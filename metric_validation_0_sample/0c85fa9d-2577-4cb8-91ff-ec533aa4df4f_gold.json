Such increase of vehicles is also related to the rise of security attacks and potential security threats. In a vehicular environment, security is one of the most important issues and it must be addressed before VANETs can be widely deployed. Conventional VANETs have some unique characteristics such as high mobility, dynamic topology, and a short connection time. Since an attacker can launch any unexpected attacks, it is difficult to predict these attacks in advance. To handle this problem, we propose collaborative security attack detection mechanism in a software-defined vehicular networks that uses multi-class support vector machine (SVM) to detect various types of attacks dynamically.

As vehicles typically afford limited processing resources, proposed solutions are rule-based or lightweight machine learning techniques. We argue that this limitation can be lifted with computational offloading commonly used for resource-constrained mobile devices. The increased processing resources available in this manner allow access to more advanced techniques. Using as case study a small four-wheel robotic land vehicle, we demonstrate the practicality and benefits of offloading the continuous task of intrusion detection that is based on deep learning. This approach achieves high accuracy much more consistently than with standard machine learning techniques and is not limited to a single type of attack or the in-vehicle CAN bus as previous work. As input, it uses data captured in real-time that relate to both cyber and physical processes, which it feeds as time series data to a neural network architecture. We use both a deep multilayer perceptron and recurrent neural network architecture, with the latter benefitting from a long-short term memory hidden layer, which proves very useful for learning the temporal context of different attacks. We employ denial of service, command injection and malware as examples of cyber attacks that are meaningful for a robotic vehicle. The practicality of computation offloading depends on the resources afforded onboard and remotely, and the reliability of the communication means between them. Using detection latency as the criterion, we have developed a mathematical model to determine when computation offloading is beneficial given parameters related to the operation of the network and the processing demands of the deep learning model.

Vehicles in VANETs share real-time information about their movement state, traffic situation, and road conditions. However, VANETs are susceptible to the cyberattacks that create life threatening situations and/or cause road congestion. Intrusion detection systems (IDSs) that rely on the cooperation between vehicles to detect intruders, were the most suggested security solutions for VANET. Unfortunately, existing cooperative IDSs (CIDSs) are vulnerable to the legitimate yet compromised collaborators that share misleading and manipulated information and disrupt the IDSs\u2019 normal operation. As such, this paper proposes a misbehavior-aware on-demand collaborative intrusion detection system (MA-CIDS) based on the concept of distributed ensemble learning. That is, vehicles individually use the random forest algorithm to train local IDS classifiers and share their locally trained classifiers on-demand with the vehicles in their vicinity, which reduces the communication overhead. Once received, the performance of the classifiers is evaluated using the local testing dataset in the receiving vehicle. The evaluation values are used as a trustworthiness factor and used to rank the received classifiers. The classifiers that deviate much from the box-and-whisker plot lower boundary are excluded from the set of the collaborators. Then, each vehicle constructs an ensemble of weighted random forest-based classifiers that encompasses the locally and remotely trained classifiers. The outputs of the classifiers are aggregated using a robust weighted voting scheme. Extensive simulations were conducted utilizing the network security laboratory-knowledge discovery data mining (NSL-KDD) dataset to evaluate the performance of the proposed MA-CIDS model.
