Disabilities affect not only children but also adults of different professions. Smart technology can assist the disabled population and lead to a comfortable life in an enhanced living environment (ELE). In this paper, we propose an effective voice pathology assessment system that works in a smart home framework. The proposed system takes input from various sensors, and processes the acquired voice signals and electroglottography (EGG) signals. Co-occurrence matrices in different directions and neighborhoods from the spectrograms of these signals were obtained. Several features such as energy, entropy, contrast, and homogeneity from these matrices were calculated and fed into a Gaussian mixture model-based classifier. Experiments were performed with a publicly available database, namely, the Saarbrucken voice database. The results demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed system in light of its high accuracy and speed. The proposed system can be extended to assess other disabilities in an ELE."}, {"bib_hash_or_arxiv_id": "171bcdbf11ff28c51194e0ead93cf972d95307bf", "row": 1, "corpus_id": 3786331, "type": "ref", "title": "Voice Pathology Detection and Classification Using Auto-Correlation and Entropy Features in Different Frequency Regions", "abstract": "Automatic voice pathology detection and classification systems effectively contribute to the assessment of voice disorders, enabling the early detection of voice pathologies and the diagnosis of the type of pathology from which patients suffer. This paper concentrates on developing an accurate and robust feature extraction for detecting and classifying voice pathologies by investigating different frequency bands using autocorrelation and entropy. We extracted maximum peak values and their corresponding lag values from each frame of a voiced signal by using autocorrelation as features to detect and classify pathological samples. We also extracted the entropy for each frame of the voice signal after we normalized its values to be used as the features. These features were investigated in distinct frequency bands to assess the contribution of each band to the detection and classification processes. Various samples of the sustained vowel /a/ for both normal and pathological voices were extracted from three different databases in English, German, and Arabic. A support vector machine was used as a classifier. We also performed u-tests to investigate if there is a significant difference between the means of the normal and pathological samples. The best achieved accuracies in both detection and classification varied depending on the used band, method, and database. The most contributive bands in both detection and classification were between 1000 and 8000 Hz. The highest obtained accuracies in the case of detection were 99.69%, 92.79%, and 99.79% for Massachusetts eye and ear infirmary (MEEI), Saarbr\u00fccken voice database (SVD), and Arabic voice pathology database (AVPD), respectively.

This study shows investigations on reducing variance for the classification of two different voice qualities (normal voice and disordered voice) using multitaper MFCC features. We also compare their performance by newly proposed windowing techniques and conventional single-taper technique. The results demonstrate that adapted weighted Thomson multitaper method could distinguish between normal voice and disordered voice better than the results done by the conventional single-taper (Hamming window) technique and two newly proposed windowing methods.

Therefore, a framework is required that facilitates collection, extraction, storage, classification, processing, and modeling of this vast heterogeneous volume of data.
