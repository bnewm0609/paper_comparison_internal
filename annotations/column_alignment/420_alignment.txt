We decompose the skeletal movements into two sub-components: global body movement and local body posture. We model the dynamics and interaction of the coupled features in our novel Message-Passing Encoder-Decoder Recurrent Network.'] | ['Compared to traditional appearance-based models, our method achieves superior outlier detection performance.']                                                                                                                                                                           |

RTFM also adapts dilated convolutions and self-attention mechanisms to capture long- and short-range temporal dependencies to learn the feature magnitude more faithfully.']                                    | ['Extensive experiments show that the RTFM-enabled MIL model outperforms several state-of-the-art methods by a large margin on four benchmark data sets.']                                                                                                                                 |
