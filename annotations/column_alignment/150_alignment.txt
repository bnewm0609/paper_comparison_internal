| paper_3  | The paper uses a helicopter dynamics model and a reward (cost) function found by a pilot. Then, it uses differential dynamic programming (DDP), an extension of the linear quadratic regulator (LQR), to find a controller that is optimized for the resulting model and reward function. | The paper shows that the learned controller enables successful autonomous completion of four aerobatic maneuvers on a real RC helicopter.                                                                                                             | The paper does not provide information about the computational cost of the learning algorithm.                                                                         | The paper provides an example where the learned controller succeeds in completing four aerobatic maneuvers, but no specific convergence values are given.                       | The paper does not provide information about the stability of the learned controller.                                                                            | The paper does not provide information about the robustness of the learned controller.                                                                            | The paper does not provide information about the generalization of the learning algorithm. |
