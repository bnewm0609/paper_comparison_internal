| Exploration of the relationship between conditional probability and under sampling | ['Under sampling one class modifies the priors of the training set and consequently biases the posterior probabilities of a classifier. The paper formalizes the problem of under sampling and explores the relationship between conditional probability in the presence and absence of under sampling.'] | ['N/A']                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | ['N/A']                                                                 |

This enables the proposed method to exploit sub-sampling to an extent that is not feasible in existing methods.'] | ['N/A']                                                                 |
