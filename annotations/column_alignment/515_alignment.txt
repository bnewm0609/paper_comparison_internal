Through developer interviews and questionnaires, we uncover findings that highlight and quantify the effects of three high-level app store themes: bridging the gap between developers and users, increasing market transparency and affecting mobile release management. These findings can help guide future research in supporting mobile app developers through a deeper understanding of the app store-developer interaction. |
