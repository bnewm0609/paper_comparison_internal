While recent CNN-based derainers have reported promising performances, deraining remains an open problem for two reasons.

Second, there are no public benchmarks for quantitative comparisons on real rain images, which makes the current evaluation less objective. The core challenge is that real world rain/clean image pairs cannot be captured at the same time. In this paper, we address the single image rain removal problem in two ways. First, we propose a semi-automatic method that incorporates temporal priors and human supervision to generate a high-quality clean image from each input sequence of real rain images. Using this method, we construct a large-scale dataset of \u223c29.5K rain/rain-free image pairs that covers a wide range of natural rain scenes.
