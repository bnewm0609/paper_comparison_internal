The need to develop and evaluate DeepFake detection algorithms calls for datasets of DeepFake videos. However, current DeepFake datasets suffer from low visual quality and do not resemble DeepFake videos circulated on the Internet. We present a new large-scale challenging DeepFake video dataset, Celeb-DF, which contains 5,639 high-quality DeepFake videos of celebrities generated using improved synthesis process. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation of DeepFake detection methods and datasets to demonstrate the escalated level of challenges posed by Celeb-DF."}, {"bib_hash_or_arxiv_id": "5d9d5cabb2f4afa43ebbf77e5f6f167e89907dd1", "row": 1, "corpus_id": 210116488, "type": "ref", "title": "DeeperForensics-1.0: A Large-Scale Dataset for Real-World Face Forgery Detection", "abstract": "We present our on-going effort of constructing a large- scale benchmark for face forgery detection. The first version of this benchmark, DeeperForensics-1.0, represents the largest face forgery detection dataset by far, with 60, 000 videos constituted by a total of 17.6 million frames, 10 times larger than existing datasets of the same kind. Extensive real-world perturbations are applied to obtain a more challenging benchmark of larger scale and higher diversity. All source videos in DeeperForensics-1.0 are carefully collected, and fake videos are generated by a newly proposed end-to-end face swapping framework. The quality of generated videos outperforms those in existing datasets, validated by user studies. The benchmark features a hidden test set, which contains manipulated videos achieving high deceptive scores in human evaluations. We further contribute a comprehensive study that evaluates five representative detection baselines and make a thorough analysis of different settings."}]}
