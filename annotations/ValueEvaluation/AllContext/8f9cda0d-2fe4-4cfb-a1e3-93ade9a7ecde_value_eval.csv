8f9cda0d-2fe4-4cfb-a1e3-93ade9a7ecde,Development,219558583,reorganization on GQA,"The GQA-OOD dataset was developed based on the existing GQA dataset. The dataset features distribution shifts for both validation and test sets. The benchmark also introduced a new set of evaluation metrics to evaluate the reasoning behavior of VQA models. The dataset was constructed using methodologies such as fine-grained reorganization of the GQA dataset, dividing questions into groups according to their contexts, and measuring group imbalance using Shannon entropy. The enhancement of the dataset involved selecting specific answer classes for each question group based on their frequencies.",1

This procedure involves iterative data collection rounds where human annotators compete against VQA models to design adversarial examples. The models used in the data collection process were trained on Faster R-CNN region features. The dataset also includes images from different domains, including web images from Conceptual Captions, user-generated images from Fakeddit, and movie images from VCR. The data collection process was conducted on Amazon Mechanical Turk.",1
