Though previous studies have provided many workable solutions for automated keyphrase extraction, they commonly divided the to-be-summarized content into multiple text chunks, then ranked and selected the most meaningful ones. These approaches could neither identify keyphrases that do not appear in the text, nor capture the real semantic meaning behind the text. We propose a generative model for keyphrase prediction with an encoder-decoder framework, which can effectively overcome the above drawbacks. We name it as deep keyphrase generation since it attempts to capture the deep semantic meaning of the content with a deep learning method. Empirical analysis on six datasets demonstrates that our proposed model not only achieves a significant performance boost on extracting keyphrases that appear in the source text, but also can generate absent keyphrases based on the semantic meaning of the text.

Key phrases that consist of one or more words and represent the main concepts of the document are often used for the purpose of indexing. In this paper, we investigate the use of additional semantic features and pre-processing steps to improve automatic key phrase extraction. These features include the use of signal words and freebase categories. Some of these features lead to significant improvements in the accuracy of the results. We also experimented with 2 forms of document pre-processing that we call light filtering and co-reference normalization. Light filtering removes sentences from the document, which are judged peripheral to its main content. Co-reference normalization unifies several written forms of the same named entity into a unique form. We also needed a \u0093Gold Standard\u0094 \u2015 a set of labeled documents for training and evaluation. While the subjective nature of key phrase selection precludes a true \u0093Gold Standard\u0094, we used Amazon's Mechanical Turk service to obtain a useful approximation. Our data indicates that the biggest improvements in performance were due to shallow semantic features, news categories, and rhetorical signals (nDCG 78.47% vs. 68.93%). The inclusion of deeper semantic features such as Freebase sub-categories was not beneficial by itself, but in combination with pre-processing, did cause slight improvements in the nDCG scores."}, {"bib_hash_or_arxiv_id": "9c50bf504c27ae87a379f8c3700981efab132a33", "row": 3, "corpus_id": 71149752, "type": "ref", "title": "PerKey: A Persian News Corpus for Keyphrase Extraction and Generation", "abstract": "Keyphrases provide an extremely dense summary of a text. Such information can be used in many Natural Language Processing tasks, such as information retrieval and text summarization.

In this paper, we introduce PerKey1, a corpus of 553k news articles from six Persian news websites and agencies with relatively high quality author extracted keyphrases, which is then filtered and cleaned to achieve higher quality keyphrases. The resulted data was put into human assessment to ensure the quality of the keyphrases.

To help users quickly capture what they need, keyphrase prediction is receiving a growing attention. Nevertheless, most prior efforts focus on text modeling, largely ignoring the rich features embedded in the matching images. In this work, we explore the joint effects of texts and images in predicting the keyphrases for a multimedia post. To better align social media style texts and images, we propose: (1) a novel Multi-Modality Multi-Head Attention (M3H-Att) to capture the intricate cross-media interactions; (2) image wordings, in forms of optical characters and image attributes, to bridge the two modalities. Moreover, we design a unified framework to leverage the outputs of keyphrase classification and generation and couple their advantages. Extensive experiments on a large-scale dataset newly collected from Twitter show that our model significantly outperforms the previous state of the art based on traditional attention networks. Further analyses show that our multi-head attention is able to attend information from various aspects and boost classification or generation in diverse scenarios."}, {"bib_hash_or_arxiv_id": "8241991e09f1b50fdea240cc17ba91b7bb246b5b", "row": 7, "corpus_id": 5210508, "type": "ref", "title": "KEA: practical automatic keyphrase extraction", "abstract": "Keyphrases provide semantic metadata that summarize and characterize documents.
