In addition, since high complexity operations such as beamforming, tracking and equalization have to be performed in IoT devices partially, both the hardware complexity and the need for high-capacity batteries of IoT devices increase. The reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) have the potential to increase the energy-efficiency and to perform complex signal processing over the transmission environment instead of IoT devices. But, RISs need the information of the cascaded channel in order to change the phase of the incident signal. This study evaluates the pilot signal as a graph and incorporates this information into the graph attention networks (GATs) to track the phase relation through pilot signaling. The proposed GAT-based channel estimation method examines the performance of the DtS IoT networks for different RIS configurations to solve the challenging channel estimation problem. It is shown that the proposed GAT both demonstrates a higher performance with increased robustness under changing conditions and has lower computational complexity compared to conventional deep learning methods. Moreover, bit error rate performance is investigated for RIS designs with discrete and non-uniform phase shifts under channel estimation based on the proposed method.

The emerging technology of reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) has recently become a potential solution to mitigate propagation-induced impairments and improve wireless network coverage. Motivated by these considerations, in this paper, we address the coverage and link performance problems of the aerial-terrestrial communication system by proposing an RIS-assisted transmission strategy. In particular, we design an adaptive RIS-assisted transmission protocol, in which the channel estimation, transmission strategy, and data transmission are independently implemented in a frame. On this basis, we formulate an RIS-assisted transmission strategy optimization problem as a mixed-integer non-linear program (MINLP) to maximize the overall system throughput. We then employ multi-task learning to speed up the solution to the problem. Benefiting from multi-task learning, the computation time is reduced by about four orders of magnitude.

The performance of the proposed method is investigated on the two-way backhauling link over the RIS-integrated HAPS.

Drones have emerged as critical assets for next-generation wireless networks to provide seamless connectivity and extend the coverage, and can largely benefit from operating in the THz band to achieve high data rates (such as considered for 6G). However, THz communications are highly susceptible to channel impairments and blockage effects that become extra challenging when accounting for drone mobility. RISs offer flexibility to extend coverage by adapting to channel dynamics. To integrate RISs into THz drone communications, we propose a novel deep learning solution based on a recurrent neural network, namely the Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU), that proactively predicts the serving base station/RIS and the serving beam for each drone based on the prior observations of drone location/beam trajectories. This solution has the potential to extend the coverage of drones and enhance the reliability of next-generation wireless communications. Predicting future beams based on the drone beam/position trajectory significantly reduces the beam training overhead and its associated latency, and thus emerges as a viable solution to serve time-critical applications.

In environments where direct communication can be impaired by, for instance, blockages such as in urban cities, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) can be considered as an alternative for providing and enhancing connectivity, particularly when IoT devices (IoTD) are constrained with their resources. Also, to conserve energy, IoTDs are assumed to alternate between their active and passive modes. This paper, therefore, considers a time-constrained data gathering problem from a network of sensing devices and with assistance from a UAV. A Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface (RIS) is deployed to further improve both the connectivity and energy efficiency of the UAV, particularly when multiple devices are served concurrently and experience different channel impairments. This integrated problem brings challenges related to the configuration of the phase shift elements of the RIS, the scheduling of IoTDs transmissions as well as the trajectory of the UAV.

In contrast to the conventional DQN algorithm, the decaying learning rate is leveraged in the proposed D-DQN based algorithm for attaining a tradeoff between accelerating training speed and converging to the local optimal. Numerical results demonstrate that: 1) In contrast to the conventional Q-learning algorithm, which cannot converge when being adopted for solving the formulated problem, the proposed D-DQN based algorithm is capable of converging with minor constraints; 2) The energy dissipation of the UAV can be significantly reduced by integrating RISs in UAV-enabled wireless networks; 3) By designing the dynamic decoding order and power allocation policy, the RIS-NOMA case consumes 11.7% less energy than the RIS-OMA case."}]}
