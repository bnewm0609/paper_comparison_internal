Prior work explores several challenges in the design of low-cost sensors, the reliability of these sensors, and their application for specific use-cases like pothole detection and pollution monitoring. However, the process of deployment of a drive-by sensing network at a city-scale is still unexplored. Despite the rise of ride-sharing services, there is still no way to optimally select vehicles from a fleet that can accomplish the sensing task by providing enough coverage of the city. In this paper, we propose Modulo -- a system to bootstrap drive-by sensing deployment by taking into consideration a variety of aspects such as spatiotemporal coverage, budget constraints. Further, Modulo is well-suited to satisfy unique deployment constraints such as colocations with other sensors (needed for gas and PM sensor calibration), etc. We compare Modulo with two baseline algorithms on real-world taxi and bus datasets. We find that Modulo marginally outperforms the two baselines for datasets with just random-routes vehicles such as taxis. However, it significantly outperforms the baselines when a fleet comprises of both taxis and fixed-route vehicles such as public transport buses. Finally, we present a real-deployment that uses Modulo to select vehicles for an air pollution sensing application."}, {"bib_hash_or_arxiv_id": "7db83cfe11d5cb530a4eb993810c0df4449a39d9", "row": 2, "corpus_id": 49329244, "type": "ref", "title": "On the Coverage of Bus-Based Mobile Sensing", "abstract": "A cost-effective approach to gather information in a smart city is to embed sensors in vehicles such as buses. To understand the limitations and opportunities of this model, it is fundamental to investigate the spatial coverage of such a network, especially in the case where only a subset of the buses have a sensing device embedded. In this paper, we propose a model to select the right subset of buses that maximizes the coverage of the city. We evaluate the model in a real scenario based on a large-scale dataset of more than 5700 buses in the city of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. Among other findings, we observe that the fleet of buses covers approximately 5655 km of streets (approximately 47% of the streets) and show that it is possible to cover 94% of the same streets if only 18% of buses have sensing capabilities embedded."}, {"bib_hash_or_arxiv_id": "c4577505bea3c8aa2dd30925bd23acb6273c685a", "row": 3, "corpus_id": 211204790, "type": "ref", "title": "Spatio-Temporal Coverage Enhancement in Drive-By Sensing Through Utility-Aware Mobile Agent Selection", "abstract": "In recent years, the drive-by sensing paradigm has become increasingly popular for cost-effective monitoring of urban areas. Drive-by sensing is a form of crowdsensing wherein sensor-equipped vehicles (aka, mobile agents) are the primary data gathering agents. Enhancing the efficacy of drive-by sensing poses many challenges, an important one of which is to select non-dedicated mobile agents on which a limited number of sensors are to be mounted. This problem, which we refer to as the mobile-agent selection problem, has a significant impact on the spatio-temporal coverage of the drive-by sensing platforms and the resultant datasets. The challenge here is to achieve maximum spatiotemporal coverage while taking the relative importance levels of geographical areas into account. In this paper, we address this problem in the context of the SCOUTS project, the goal of which is to map and analyze the urban heat island phenomenon accurately. Our work makes several major technical contributions. First, we delineate a model for representing the mobile agents selection problem. This model takes into account the trajectories of the vehicles (public transportation buses in our case) and the relative importance of the urban regions, and formulates it as an optimization problem. Second, we provide two algorithms that are based upon the utility (coverage) values of mobile agents, namely, a hotspot-based algorithm that limits the search space to important sub-regions and a utility-aware genetic algorithm that enables the latter algorithm to make unbiased selections. Third, we design a highly efficient coverage redundancy minimization algorithm that, at each step, chooses the mobile agent, which provides maximal improvement to the spatio-temporal coverage. This paper reports a series of experiments on a real-world dataset from Athens, GA, USA, to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approaches."}]}
