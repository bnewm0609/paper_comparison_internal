The chronotherapy approach, considering chronobiological drug delivery, adapts the chemotherapy profile to the circadian rhythms of the human organism. This reduces toxicity effects and at the same time enhances efficiency of chemotherapy. To personalize cancer treatment, chemotherapy profiles have to be further adapted to individual patients. Therefore, we present a new model to represent cycle phenomena in circadian rhythms. The model enables a more precise modelling of the underlying circadian rhythms. In comparison with the standard model, our model delivers better results in all defined quality indices. The new model can be used to adapt the chemotherapy profile efficiently to individual patients. The adaption to individual patients contributes to the aim of personalizing cancer therapy."}, {"bib_hash_or_arxiv_id": "d3c694e9a00ccbe7c4737bc87476738526b3251c", "row": 1, "corpus_id": 15843191, "type": "ref", "title": "A Benchmark Data Set to Evaluate the Illumination Robustness of Image Processing Algorithms for Object Segmentation and Classification", "abstract": "Developers of image processing routines rely on benchmark data sets to give qualitative comparisons of new image analysis algorithms and pipelines. Such data sets need to include artifacts in order to occlude and distort the required information to be extracted from an image. Robustness, the quality of an algorithm related to the amount of distortion is often important. However, using available benchmark data sets an evaluation of illumination robustness is difficult or even not possible due to missing ground truth data about object margins and classes and missing information about the distortion. We present a new framework for robustness evaluation. The key aspect is an image benchmark containing 9 object classes and the required ground truth for segmentation and classification. Varying levels of shading and background noise are integrated to distort the data set. To quantify the illumination robustness, we provide measures for image quality, segmentation and classification success and robustness. We set a high value on giving users easy access to the new benchmark, therefore, all routines are provided within a software package, but can as well easily be replaced to emphasize other aspects."}, {"bib_hash_or_arxiv_id": "10e6ef998c2f18ad671acf84a27cdd5834b3c765", "row": 2, "corpus_id": 17924888, "type": "ref", "title": "Nearest-Neighbor Based Non-Parametric Probabilistic Forecasting with Applications in Photovoltaic Systems", "abstract": "The present contribution offers a simple methodology for the obtainment of data-driven interval forecasting models by combining pairs of quantile regressions. Those regressions are created without the usage of the non-differentiable pinball-loss function, but through a k-nearest-neighbors based training set transformation and traditional regression approaches. By leaving the underlying training algorithms of the data mining techniques unchanged, the presented approach simplifies the creation of quantile regressions with more complex techniques (e.g. artificial neural networks). The quality of the presented methodology is tested on the usecase of photovoltaic power forecasting, for which quantile regressions using polynomial models as well as artificial neural networks and support vector regressions are created. From the resulting evaluation values it can be concluded that acceptable interval forecasting models are created."}]}
