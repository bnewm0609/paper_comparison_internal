Despite all the interest and concerted effort, the complexity and interconnectivity of the electric infrastructure have so far precluded us from understanding why certain events happened. In this paper we study the power grid from a network perspective and determine its ability to transfer power between generators and consumers when certain nodes are disrupted. We find that the power grid is robust to most perturbations, yet disturbances affecting key transmision substations greatly reduce its ability to function. We emphasize that the global properties of the underlying network must be understood as they greatly affect local behavior."}, {"bib_hash_or_arxiv_id": "48bd5488a859761ae6f5779a97e161411734cc59", "row": 1, "corpus_id": 119419887, "type": "ref", "title": "Evaluating North American Electric Grid Reliability Using the Barabasi-Albert Network Model", "abstract": "The reliability of electric transmission systems is examined using a scale-free model of network structure and failure propagation. The topologies of the North American eastern and western electric networks are analyzed to estimate their reliability based on the Barabasi-Albert network model. A commonly used power system reliability index is computed using a simple failure propagation model. The results are compared to the values of power system reliability indices previously obtained using standard power system reliability analysis methods, and they suggest that scale-free network models are useful for estimating aggregate electric network reliability."}]}
