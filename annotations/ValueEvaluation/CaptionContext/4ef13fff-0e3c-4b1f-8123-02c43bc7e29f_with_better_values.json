Accordingly, base stations (BSs) and edge servers (ESs) need to be densely deployed, leading to huge deployment and operation costs, in particular the energy costs. In this article, we propose a new framework called Mobility-Enhanced Edge inTelligence (MEET), which exploits the sensing, communication, computing, and self-powering capabilities of intelligent connected vehicles for the smart and green 6G networks. Specifically, the operators can incorporate infrastructural vehicles as movable BSs or ESs, and schedule them in a more flexible way to align with the communication and computation traffic fluctuations. Meanwhile, the remaining compute resources of opportunistic vehicles are exploited for edge training and inference, where mobility can further enhance edge intelligence by bringing more compute resources, communication opportunities, and diverse data. In this way, the deployment and operation costs are spread over the vastly available vehicles, so that the edge intelligence is realized cost-effectively and sustainably. Furthermore, these vehicles can be either powered by renewable energy to reduce carbon emissions, or charged more flexibly during off-peak hours to cut electricity bills."}, {"bib_hash_or_arxiv_id": "b22ec409f08f090a1fce8c0ac55ac08455502ebd", "row": 1, "corpus_id": 214623220, "type": "ref", "title": "UAVs as a Service: Boosting Edge Intelligence for Air-Ground Integrated Networks", "abstract": "The air-ground integrated network is a key component of future sixth generation (6G) networks to support seamless and near-instant super-connectivity. There is a pressing need to intelligently provision various services in 6G networks, which however is challenging. To meet this need, in this article, we propose a novel architecture called UaaS (UAVs as a Service) for the air-ground integrated network, featuring UAV as a key enabler to boost edge intelligence with the help of machine learning (ML) techniques. We envision that the proposed UaaS architecture could intelligently provision wireless communication service, edge computing service, and edge caching service by a network of UAVs, making full use of UAVs' flexible deployment and diverse ML techniques. We also conduct a case study where UAVs participate in the model training of distributed ML among multiple terrestrial users, whose result shows that the model training is efficient with a negligible energy consumption of UAVs, compared to the flight energy consumption. Finally, we discuss the challenges and open research issues in the UaaS."}]}
