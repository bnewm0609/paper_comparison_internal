Integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) is a promising technique that can provide integration or coordination gains for the sensing and communication services [1]. In addition, ISAC is deemed to achieve high spectral efficiency and low hardware cost via integrating two functionalities into a single system [2].\n\nIn particular, since the communication channels are highly dynamic in the vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) scenarios, it is challenging to acquire the real-time channel state information (CSI) of the vehicles. To address this issue, there have been several works studying ISAC-enabled V2I communications. The works in [3]- [5] employed the ISAC signal to realize V2I beam tracking and prediction. With the ISAC signal, various beam prediction methods were utilized, such as extended Kalman filtering in [3], factor graph in [4], and deep learning in [5]. The above works show the great superiority of the ISAC-based scheme over the conventional communicationonly scheme in terms of reducing the pilot overhead. However, They only considered the line-of-sight (LoS) link between the roadside units and the user equipment (UE), while the non-LoS (NLoS) paths that facilitate communication were not fully exploited.\n\nReconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS), consisting of a large number of reflecting elements, can independently adjust the amplitude and phase shift of each element to reconfigure the wireless environment [6], [7]. The RIS is typically deployed in the NLoS region to create a virtual LoS link between the transmitter and receiver, which is useful for both sensing and communication. There are already several works on RISassisted ISAC system. In [8], [9], the RIS was employed to minimize multi-user interference under the constraints of beampattern and Cram\u00e9r-Rao bound, respectively. Furthermore, the RIS-related CSI can be obtained with the aid of the ISAC by estimating the parameters of the UEs, which can be used for the reflective beamforming design. However, it should be noted that in the conventional mono-static sensing scenario, the base station (BS) acts as the mono-static radar and the acquisition of RIS-related CSI is based on the BS-RIStarget-RIS-BS link. Thus, the echo signals will suffer severe attenuation due to the high path loss. To address this problem, the authors in [10] designed a self-sensing RIS architecture to mitigate the impact of path loss by reducing the reflection hops, while they simply focused on the sensing performance without concern for the communication performance.\n\nIn this paper, motivated by the above works, we propose a novel RIS-assisted ISAC system serving the vehicle, where the CSI of the UE can be obtained by the received echo signals to reduce the pilot overhead and improve the communication rate. First, we design a a transmission protocol based on communication-sensing-computing integration architecture for the proposed system.  Fig. 1.

The CAP-Net is composed of the convolutional neural network (CNN) and the long short-term memory (LSTM) network, which is exploited to predict angles of arrival (AoAs) based on historical covariance matrices of the received echo signals. Finally, the transmit and reflective beamforming can be jointly optimized to achieve higher communication rate.\n\nThe remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section II provides the RIS-assisted ISAC system model and the transmission protocol. The proposed CAP-Net is described in Section III.

It has been proven to be a promising way to achieve better channel estimation performance for the IRS-aided wireless communication system than traditional methods (e.g., least-square algorithm). However, existing DL-based methods rely on ground truth (labels of the true channels) which is difficult to obtain in real networks. In this paper, we propose a self-supervised learning (SSL) method for the IRS channel estimation problem.

We also show that the developed scheme exhibits robustness to SNR ratio mismatch.", "introduction": "\n\nI NTELLIGENT reflecting surface (IRS) [1], [2], [3], [4] is one of the promising techniques for the beyond fifthgeneration (B5G) networks. It can enhance the coverage and capacity of wireless communication systems with low hardware costs and energy consumption. Usually, an IRS is composed of numerous passive reflection elements, which can obtain customized reflection signals by adjusting the electromagnetic properties such as the phase of the incident electromagnetic signal. Thus, IRS can act as an intelligent relay to increase the flexibility of the wireless network. Compared with relay-based wireless communication technology, IRS does not need to consume huge energy and does not introduce additional noise. A more detailed comparison of IRS and other communication techniques can refer to [2]. Because of the excellent properties of IRS, it has attracted a lot of research interest [5] and has been proven a promising way to enhance various wireless communication networks, e.g., non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) systems [6], unmanned aerial vehicles-based wireless communications [7], etc. To realize a high-performance IRS communication system, high-precision channel estimation is essential.\n\nThe related work [8] points out that only when perfect channel state information (CSI) is obtained, can IRS fully exert its excellent characteristics. Actually, according to [9], the acquisition of perfect CSI is quite challenging in practice. With precise CSI, advanced methods, such as the machine learning method proposed in [10], can perform well optimizing transmit and reflecting beamforming in an IRS-assisted wireless system. Different from traditional wireless systems, IRS as a kind of passive component cannot send, receive and process pilot signals, making the IRS-involved channel difficult to estimate. Thus, directly estimating the cascaded user-IRS-base station channel estimation is a typical way [11]. In addition, compared to the traditional systems, there are often a large number of passive components in IRS systems, and the dimension of the cascaded channels is large, which results in a large pilot overhead. To address these obstacles, efficient channel estimations are studied by many related works. For example, a leastsquare (LS)-based estimation method is used in [12] and [13]. In [12], the LS estimator is aimed at obtaining the unbiased cascaded channel for single-user multiple-input single-output (SU-MISO) systems. Binary reflection-controlled least-square channel estimation is proposed in [13] for IRS-aided energy transfer from a multi-antenna power beacon to a single-antenna user. This new LS-based channel estimation protocol suggests that IRS can only switch on one reflecting element and switch off the remaining reflecting elements at each time slot. The minimum mean squared error (MMSE)-based estimator is another solution to the IRS channel estimation problem. In [14], channel estimation in a coherence block is divided into two sub-stages. By turning off the entire IRS in the first sub-stage, the base station estimates the channel between itself and the user. Following this, the passive reflection elements of the IRS are turned on in turn to allow the base station to perform the estimation. MMSE method is used after estimation results of all sub-phases are taken together. The literature [14] indicates that the MMSE estimates are both analytically and numerically shown to achieve a much lower estimation error than the conventional LS estimates. As presented in [15], the performance of the available LS-based estimators still has a large gap compared with the optimal Bayesian MMSE estimator. While the optimal MMSE estimator needs to know the probability distribution of the channel (which is difficult to achieve in practice) and involves a multidimensional integration that has high complexity. The optimal MMSE estimator is also difficult to achieve in the real IRS network. Sparse matrix factorization, ambiguity elimination, and matrix completion are used in [16] to achieve a three-stage IRS channel estimation mechanism. However, a lot of iterative steps need to be performed to achieve the optimization of each stage. This limits its efficient execution in real networks. Thankfully, the development of deep learning (DL) provides support for low-complexity algorithmic inference and it promises to be a good tradeoff between channel estimation performance and complexity.\n\nDifferent from traditional methods, DL can learn the mapping from the input data to the desired output and get at least a locally optimal solution. The main reasons why it attracts a large number of researchers carrying out cutting-edge research are: 1) The neural network used in deep learning only uses simple matrix multiplication in the inference process, and does not require complex iterative optimization. 2) Deep learning has the generalization ability, that is, a trained neural network can perform well on samples that have never been seen before. Regarding the channel estimation problem as a supervised learning problem, several DL-based methods [17], [18], [19] have shown their remarkable performance in the IRS channel estimation task. The recent work [20] which proposes a model-driven deep unfolding scheme also shows that DL can achieve low-complexity online inference with a trained model.\n\nRelated works [17], [18] explore the combination of wireless communication models and deep learning to achieve channel estimation for IRS networks. In [17], the traditional multi-stage channel estimation method is used to construct the dataset to train neural networks. In [18], the compressed sensing technique is used to improve estimation accuracy. Both of the above research adopted a convolutional neural network (CNN) to solve the channel estimation problem for IRS-assisted communication systems. However, the method proposed in [17] requires turning on individual IRS elements in a sequence, which needs to deploy a hybrid passive/active IRS, thus may incur additional training overhead or hardware costs. Different from them, an end-to-end supervised learning method is proposed in [15], where a convolutional deep residual network (CDRN) is proposed to reconstruct the channel from the noisy pilot-based observations. It improves the channel estimation accuracy without the requirements of additional system deployment. Similarly, [19] proposes to use residual dense network structure to obtain better channel estimation generalization and fitting capabilities by leveraging the low-rank structure of IRS channels. In [21], enhanced residual neural networks, which leverage the rank-deficient structure of RIS channels, are proposed to obtain accurate channel state information. In [22], data-driven nonlinear solutions based on deep learning are proposed, which are two convolutional neural network-based methods to perform denoising and approximate optimal MMSE channel estimation solutions. Although these studies have shown the performance superiority of deep learning as a solution for channel estimation, these schemes all use supervised learning to complete the training of neural networks. A natural question is how the labels needed for supervised learning are obtained in practice. Obviously, if the labels are obtained by traditional channel estimation algorithms (e.g., LS estimator or multi-stage channel estimation proposed in [14]), the performance of supervised learning methods will be limited by the performance of traditional algorithms. And end-to-end training of the neural network, like the method used in [15], needs to use the ground truth channel label to calculate the loss function to update the neural network. However, it is difficult to obtain the ground truth channel in the real world. Thus, an effective and practical method that takes advantage of the good properties (generalization ability, competitive online inference ability) of DL without relying on ground truth is expected.\n\nThe motivation of our work is to propose a DL method that does not require ground-truth labels to efficiently solve the IRS channel estimation problem. In this work, we propose a self-supervised learning algorithm 1 to achieve the above goal. Self-supervised learning (SSL) can be considered a kind of unsupervised learning which learns from unlabeled samples [23]. Usually, unsupervised learning works towards clustering and dimensionality reduction, whereas SSL performs conclusive tasks like classification and regression like any supervised model. The main idea of SSL is to self-generate labeled data by defining a pretext task that guides us to a supervised loss function and empowers us to exploit a variety 1 The code to reproduce this algorithm is open-sourced: https://github.com/jhcknzzm/SSL-Based-IRS-Channel-Estimation of labels that come with the data for free. In this context, our main contributions are the following:\n\n1. We propose a novel SSL method for IRS-aided wireless network channel estimation. Specifically, first, a new neural network architecture is designed, which is inspired by existing research on residual neural networks for channel estimation. Through empirical experiments, we demonstrate that this neural network outperforms existing neural networks CDRN [15] on the considered task. Then, we design a simple denoising pretext task to train this neural network. This pretext task lets the neural network reconstruct the input from a noisy version of the received signal. It is worth emphasizing that we do not assume that the perfect channel state information or the received signal not polluted by wireless transmission noise can be obtained as training labels. Besides, our solution is an unconventional learning method where training and testing are not reciprocal, i.e., in the test phase, the input is different from that in the training phase. Specifically, the input of the neural network in the test phase is the imprecise channel estimation calculated by the LS while the input of the training is the received signal.\n\n2. An interesting double descent phenomenon is observed by using the proposed channel estimation where training and testing are not reciprocal. Specifically, we observe \"epochwise double descent\" when we increase the training time, with test performance following a classical U-like curve in the underfitting stage (the same as the fundamental biasvariance trade-off concept) and then improving with training time to be sufficiently larger (contrary to traditional statistical learning theory but in line with advanced double descent theory). This phenomenon, which has not been observed in channel estimation work before, implies that we can train neural networks without early stopping [24] to achieve good performance.\n\n3. We analyze the similarity of SSL-trained models and supervised learning-trained models through loss landscape and centered kernel alignment (CKA). The loss landscape results show that the self-supervised trained model has similar generalization performance to supervised learning can be exhibited, and the CKA results show that the feature representation by self-supervised learning is also similar to supervised trained models. The extensive empirical evaluations show the proposed self-supervised solution has competitive performance. Besides, we show that the developed scheme exhibits robustness to signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) mismatch, i.e., our algorithm is robust when there is a certain difference in the distribution of test and training data.\n\nThe novelty of our work lies in the realization of channel estimation without ground-truth labels by establishing a simple and effective self-supervised learning scheme. Although its performance cannot exceed supervised learning, it offers the possibility to apply the good generalization ability of DL in real-world situations where labels are not available.\n\nThe rest of this paper is organized as follows. In Section II, we introduce our considered system model and the cascaded channel estimation problem of the intelligent reflecting surface-aided wireless communication network. In Section III, we propose a self-supervised learning method. In this section, the loss landscape and centered kernel alignment for analyzing the similarity between models are also introduced. Finally, numerical results and discussions are presented in Section IV, and a conclusion is drawn in Section V.\n\n\n"}, {"paperid": "paper2", "title": "Deep-Learning Channel Estimation for IRS-Assisted Integrated Sensing and Communication System", "abstract": "Integrated sensing and communication (ISAC), and intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) are envisioned as revolutionary technologies to enhance spectral and energy efficiencies for next wireless system generations.

A three-stage approach is proposed to decouple the estimation problem into sub-ones, including the estimation of the direct SAC channels in the first stage, reflected communication channel in the second stage, and reflected sensing channel in the third stage. The proposed three-stage approach is based on a deep-learning framework, which involves two different convolutional neural network (CNN) architectures to estimate the channels at the full-duplex ISAC base station.

ISAC merges the sensing and communication (SAC) functionalities into a single system. The sensing functionality of ISAC collects and extracts the sensory information from noisy observations. Thus, it is envisioned as a critical enabler to measure or predict the surrounding wireless environment intelligently. On the other hand, the communication functionality processes and transfers the received noisy signals, with the ultimate goal of recovering the transmitted information accurately. Based on these concepts, to successfully integrate SAC into a single system and expand ISAC to a wide variety of wireless networks, the performance trade-off between SAC has been analyzed in the literature [4], [5], [6], [7], [8]. The authors in [4] and [5] focused on optimizing the sensing functionality, such as the target detection probability and target angle estimation accuracy, while guaranteeing an acceptable communication performance. On the other hand, the sensing-assisted communication scheme that promotes the communication performance was investigated in [6], [7], [8], including the sensing-assisted beam training, tracking, and prediction. The aforementioned works typically assumed that perfect channel state information (CSI) is available at the receiver side and rarely considered the channel estimation issue for the ISAC systems. Recently, another interesting study of sensing-assisted communication was performed in [9], which designed the precoder of the roadside units (RSU) and the received beamforming of the vehicle. With the help of the radar mounted on the RSU, the covariance matrices of both SAC channels were estimated by the echo signals to facilitate the transceiver beamforming design. However, the SAC channels in [9] were assumed to share the same dominant paths. Hence, its estimation approach is only limited to that specific case.\n\nIntelligent reflecting surface (IRS) has emerged as another promising technique to increase the coverage and capacity of next wireless system generations; it enables a programmable wireless propagation environment [10], [11], [12], [13]. In general, IRS is an artificial planar surface comprising a large number of low-cost passive reflecting elements. Each element independently configures its phase-shift according to the CSI of the surrounding environment and further controls the reflection of the incident signals [10]. By properly coordinating the phaseshifts of all the IRS elements, the signal transmission quality and system performance can be improved. This technology is referred to as passive beamforming [14], [15], [16]. Note that the above beamforming gain is based on an accurate CSI of the IRS-assisted wireless communication system. As such, estimating the channels is crucial in such a system. Since the reflected channel matrix (e.g., user equipment (UE)-IRS-base station (BS) link) has a large dimension and does not follow the traditional Rayleigh distribution, two challenges come up to the channel estimation [17], [18]. One challenge is the limited estimation accuracy, while the other one is the large training overhead. To overcome these challenges, model-driven channel estimation approaches have been widely researched recently, such as the reflection pattern controlled [19], [20] and element grouping schemes [21], [22]. Despite the vital contributions of these works, the above challenges have not been sufficiently addressed yet. Therefore, the data-driven deep-learning (DL) estimation approaches are further investigated in [23], [24], [25], [26]. These DL-based approaches reflect the potential to balance the estimation accuracy and training overhead in the IRS-assisted communication systems. The mapping between the received signals and channels is successfully characterized by adopting various DL networks, such as convolutional neural network (CNN) [23], [24], recurrent neural network [25], and deep residual learning [26].\n\nSince IRS has shown great prospects in enriching communication coverage and spectral/energy efficiency, it is expected to assist the ISAC system in providing better SAC performance. Recently, ISAC and IRS have been jointly explored, taking into account their cooperation merits [27], [28], [29], [30]. Due to the fact that the SAC signals coexist in the IRS-assisted ISAC systems, inherent interference occurs and affects the SAC performance. Then, the ISAC BS and IRS beamforming, as well as the ISAC waveform, are required to be properly designed for such systems. The authors in [27] and [28] concentrated on the beamforming designs for both the ISAC BS and IRS to provide a tradeoff between SAC performance, considering the effect of inherent interference. On the other hand, the joint ISAC waveform and IRS beamforming designs were investigated for the IRS-assisted ISAC systems in [29] and [30], aiming to mitigate the inherent interference while improving the communication performance under the constraints of sensing metrics. It is worth noting that an accurate CSI is necessary for all the aforementioned designs. The channel estimation problem in such IRS-assisted ISAC systems is challenging due to the inherent interference; to the best of the authors' knowledge, this problem has not been investigated yet. Considering the research gap in the existing literature, this paper proposes a novel three-stage channel estimation approach for an IRS-assisted ISAC multiple-input single-output (MISO) system. Each stage is devised at the full-duplex (FD) ISAC BS, and then a DL estimation framework is developed correspondingly, along with input-output pairs designs. In particular, the contributions of this paper are summarized as follows:\n\n1) A three-stage estimation approach is proposed to estimate the SAC channels of the IRS-assisted ISAC system. It decouples the overall estimation problem into sub-ones by controlling an on/off state of the IRS or BS transmission. The proposed estimator successively estimates the direct SAC, reflected UE-IRS-BS, and reflected BS-target-IRS-BS channels. The proposed approach is the first attempt to provide a practical channel estimation for such a system and successfully solves the estimation difficulty caused by the inherent interference. 2) The pilot transmission protocol for each stage is precisely designed to facilitate the SAC channels estimation. It involves the design of the pilot sequences adopted at the FD ISAC BS, pilot sequences employed at the UE, and IRS phase-shift vectors.\n\n\n"}]
