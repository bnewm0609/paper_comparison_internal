The small wavelength (\u223c 5mm) enables miniature antenna-arrays that can form highly directional \"pencil beams\" to boost link quality and spatial reuse. mmWave is thus considered as an enabling technology for 5G wireless broadband [1]. Recent commercialization of 60 GHz devices (e.g., by Qualcomm [2] and Intel [3]) also triggers low-cost mmWave sensing applications, which used to be available only in dedicated environment for medical/security inspection. Together, short wavelength and high directionality translates into high sensitivity, enabling subtle object localization/tracking [4], vital-sign detection and mobile mmWave imaging [5].\n\nRealizing the vision of mmWave networking and sensing necessitates a reconfigurable experimental platform that allows prototyping before the protocols/applications are deployed. Ideally, one would need a mmWave software-radio platform that allows reconfiguration from the PHY layer up to applications, can transmit customized waveforms and acquire RSS/phase information for sensing applications [4,[6][7][8]. On the 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz microwave spectrum, counterpart devices such as USRP [9], WARP [10] and Sora [11] have reshaped the landscape of wireless experimentation in the past decade, speeding up the ratification of nextgeneration wireless standards (e.g., 802.11ax [12]) and sensing appliances [13]. However, to our knowledge, there exists no reconfigurable platform that can capture the unique features of 60 GHz wireless systems, particularly the Gsps sampling bandwidth and electronically steerable phased-array antennas.\n\nIn this paper, we propose OpenMili, an open-access 60 GHz software-radio, which fills the gap and opens up new directions for mmWave sensing and protocol development. OpenMili has a software-defined mmWave network stack spanning PHY layer signal processing to applications. It can also act as a programmable 60 GHz radio sensor with a custom-built phased-array. From the hardware architecture perspective, OpenMili integrates off-the-shelf baseband processing unit (BPU), ADC/DAC and 60 GHz RF front-end (frequency up/down-converters), and develops a signal chain to enable Gsps of sampling bandwidth. It allows flexible channelization and reclocks the 60 GHz front-end to overcome its inherent phase-noise problem. OpenMili's baseband processing unit (BPU) centers around a Kintex Ultra-Scale FPGA, and uses a customized PCIe module to realize 1 Gsps real-time sample streaming from/to a PC host. The PC host can reconfigure/monitor the RF front-end and signal processing modules in real-time. OpenMili's most out-standing feature is a reconfigurable phased-array antenna that can switch between 16 beam patterns at \u03bcs granularity, under the control of the BPU. We design the phased-array specifically to fit the WR-15 waveguide (a standard antenna interface on 60 GHz radios), ensuring it can retrofit both OpenMili's RF front-end and other commercial mmWave radios that are typically equipped with WR-15 horn antennas [14].\n\nFrom the software architecture perspective, OpenMili takes advantage of the massive parallelization on the FPGA to enable Gsps sample processing. It eases prototyping by using C++ to define signal processing blocks, and using AXI [15] as inter-block gluing mechanism, which facilitates modularity and eliminates the need for inter-block rate matchinga well-known headache in FPGA programming. We choose this programming model also because the complexity of intrablock parallelization can be hidden from application developers, although coarse-grained inter-block parallelization still need to be explicitly expressed.\n\nOpenMili provides three reference designs which we believe to capture the unique aspects of mmWave and can be instrumental for a wide range of 60 GHz network protocols and wireless sensing applications [4,[6][7][8]. (i) Gbps baseband communication module: allowing a wide range of network protocol development on the FPGA or PC host; (ii) Real-time RSS/phase sensing: using an 802.11ad-like preamble to sense the channel state information (CSI), with around 300K CSI readings per second across 1 GHz bandwidth, enabling many real-time sensing applications [8]. (iii) Real-time phased-array controller: allowing 16 beamforming patterns based on a discrete codebook. Codebook entry selection is made in real-time on a Microblaze processor, programmable in C. This module can also access the real-time CSI statistics, allowing beam adaptation based on channel conditions.\n\nTo showcase the use of OpenMili in prototyping 60 GHz systems, we propose and implement two new 60 GHz location sensing and beamforming adaptation mechanisms, which are of independent interest. (i) Pairwise relative localization of phased-arrays. Many recent systems have used 2.4 GHz phased-arrays [16,17] for angle-of-arrival (AoA) estimation, but they need multiple phased-arrays to triangulate a target radio, and they assume the phase-shift values are continuously adjustable, which is not applicable to practical 60 GHz phased-arrays that use hard-wired phase-shifters. We propose a simple algorithm that leverages the discrete phaseshifting to estimate the AoA as well as distance between a pair of phased-arrays, enabling pairwise localization instead of triangulation. (ii) Learning-assisted real-time beam adaptation. The short-wavelength at 60 GHz enables compact phased-array design, with many antenna elements but correspondingly a large number of beamforming codebook entries to choose from, which entails huge adaptation overhead at run time. We propose a new principle to make this tradeoff: we allow a pair of phased-array nodes to learn the correlation between beam patterns offline, and then prune the adaptation space at run-time, which substantially saves the beam searching overhead.\n\nContributions. To prepare for an open-source release, we have intentionally used off-the-shelf hardware modules to build OpenMili (except for the programmable phasedarray). Our main contribution lies in tasking these modules into a reconfigurable architecture, designing the soft- ware framework and common interfaces to enable the development of new mmWave communication and sensing applications. This contribution breaks down into the following aspects: (i) Hardware architecture (Sec. 2 and 4): We develop the first 60 GHz reconfigurable radio architecture that achieves Gsps sampling bandwidth, Gbps wireless bit-rate, and Gsps real-time sample streaming from/to a PC host. The hardware architecture builds on customized clocking, channelization and interfacing modules. Most remarkably, it incorporates the first programmable 60 GHz phased-array design.\n\n(ii) Software framework (Sec. 3): We explore FPGA programming models that ease development, through automatic parallelization inside signal processing blocks, and modular, rate-insensitive interfaces across blocks. We also provide reference designs to bootstrap the development of protocols and sensing applications, featuring the Gbps communications and beam steering capabilities of 60 GHz radios.\n\n(iii) New network protocol and sensing modality (Sec. 6): We design a new 60 GHz beam adaptation protocol and a simple pairwise location application. We further showcase the usefulness of the reconfigurable platform in prototyping and experimenting with such mechanisms.\n\nThe software code and hardware schematics of OpenMili will be available on our project website [18].\n\n\n"}, {"paperid": "paper1", "title": "M-Cube: a millimeter-wave massive MIMO software radio", "abstract": "Millimeter-wave (mmWave) technologies represent a cornerstone for emerging wireless network infrastructure, and for RF sensing systems in security, health, and automotive domains. Through a MIMO array of phased arrays with hundreds of antenna elements, mmWave can boost wireless bit-rates to 100+ Gbps, and potentially achieve near-vision sensing resolution. However, the lack of an experimental platform has been impeding research in this field. This paper fills the gap with M3 (M-Cube), the first mmWave massive MIMO software radio. M3 features a fully reconfigurable array of phased arrays, with up to 8 RF chains and 288 antenna elements. Despite the orders of magnitude larger antenna arrays, its cost is orders of magnitude lower, even when compared with state-of-the-art single RF chain mmWave software radios. The key design principle behind M3 is to hijack a low-cost commodity 802.11ad radio, separate the control path and data path inside, regenerate the phased array control signals, and recreate the data signals using a programmable baseband. Extensive experiments have demonstrated the effectiveness of the M3 design, and its usefulness for research in mmWave massive MIMO communication and sensing.", "introduction": "\n\nMillimeter-wave (mmWave) networking technologies are widely recognized as the most promising solution to confront the mobile data explosion. However, commercially viable use cases, e.g., 60 GHz 802.11ad and 70 GHz backhaul, have been limited to short-range, static, point-to-point settings. The fundamental reason lies in the use of highly directional beams as the communication medium, which can be easily disturbed by obstacle blockage and device movement. These challenges become most severe when a large phased array is used, with a massive number of antenna elements (and hence a large number of directional beams to manage).\n\nIn addition, mmWave devices can serve as RF sensors to achieve high spatial resolution, owing to their intrinsically shorter wavelength, wider bandwidth, and larger antenna aperture [32]. Besides conventional use cases such as vehicular radar ranging and security/medical imaging, mmWave sensing is becoming available on pervasive mobile devices. For example, the 5G NR standard has incorporated mmWave location sensing [59]. Meanwhile, the emerging 802.11ay standard also introduces a WLAN radar mode which repurposes the mmWave radio as a MIMO radar [1].\n\nTo fully explore the challenges and opportunities in mmWave technologies, it is critical to have a programmable experimental platform with the following capabilities: (i) Equipped with low-cost and large-scale phased arrays which allow real-time beam switching, to accommodate high mobility vehicular networking/sensing scenarios; (ii) Supporting the mmWave MIMO architectures to be used in 5G NR and 802.11ay radios [22,37]; (iii) Allowing reconfiguration of beam patterns, communication/sensing algorithms and network stack. Existing mmWave experimental platforms are either too costly (around $200K per link [33,39]), or lack a reconfigurable phased array antenna with reasonable size [39,48,65]. Moreover, such devices are often bulky and can barely support mobile experiments. None of the existing platforms include support for both multiple RF chains and reconfigurable phased arrays, which are critical for research into mmWave MIMO.\n\nIn this paper, we describe the design and implementation of M 3 , the first mmWave massive MIMO experimental platform to meet the aforementioned requirements. M 3 is a low-cost softwaredefined radio/radar comprised of up to 256 antenna elements and up to 8 RF chains. The key research thrust in M 3 is to repurpose a commodity 802.11ad phased array as a programmable phased array, and to interface it with an existing baseband processing unit (BPU), such as an FPGA with data converters, or a low-frequency software radio. M 3 's software radio/radar design cuts the per-node cost significantly, e.g., down to $3.8K for a narrowband (  2 RF-chain 72-antenna mmWave MIMO, and below $15K for a wideband (4 GHz) 4 RF-chain 128-antenna version.\n\nThe key observation behind the M 3 design is that many modern mmWave radios [9,42] adopt a split-IF (intermediate frequency) architecture as shown in Fig. 1. The baseband-to-IF and IF-to-RFplus-antenna modules, henceforth referred to as baseband module (BM) and phased array module (PM), are realized in two separate chips, connected through a single coaxial cable that carries both data and control signals. By reverse engineering the control channel, and regenerating the control signals using an external FPGA, we gain full access to the phased array, including reconfiguring its codebook entries (beam patterns), triggering beam scanning, selecting and switching between the beam patterns in real-time, and tuning the individual antenna element gain. For the data channel, we replace the original 802.11ad BM with a customized BPU, along with a bridge board that interfaces the BPU and the PM. The bridge board is designed such that it can take as input/output either baseband I/Q signals or modulated RF signals below 4 GHz. With this board, the low-cost commodity phased array can be attached to any existing BPU, such as a USRP, WARP, or customized FPGAs.\n\nTo extend this architecture to a mmWave MIMO setup, we found that recently emerged multi-phased-array 802.11ad radios [3,30] provide the same data channel to multiple carrier-synchronized phased arrays, and can switch on one or more of them simultaneously. By interfacing each phased array to a separate bridge board and separate ADC/DAC channel on the BPU, we can construct a hybrid beamforming architecture with up to 8 RF chains, each attached to a 6\u00d76 phased array. Furthermore, by clock-sharing between the transmitter and receiver path, we can convert an M 3 node into a software-defined mmWave MIMO radar with a massive number of phased array elements. In addition, the phased arrays can be rearranged into a ring or cube layout, to expand the field-of-view to the entire 3D space.\n\nWe have conducted comprehensive measurement and testing to validate the feasibility and effectiveness of the M 3 design. Our key findings include: (i) Reconfigurability. After a one-time calibration, the multiple phased arrays on M 3 can be reconfigured separately to generate desired beam widths and directions. M 3 enables realtime mmWave MIMO communication, channel measurement, and radar sensing. (ii) Control path performance. M 3 can control the beam switching in real-time with a latency of 412 ns, which is commensurate with commodity 802.11ad radios. (iii) Data path performance. The bridge board design in M 3 does not degrade the phase noise and signal to noise ratio (SNR) level. Depending on the sampling frequency of the BPU, it can achieve an end-to-end SNR of 19 dB.  Figure 2: Measurement setup to anatomize a commodity split-IF 802.11ad radio.\n\nFurthermore, we conducted two case studies to demonstrate the application of M 3 in exploring mmWave MIMO networking and sensing systems. (i) Context-aware mmWave MIMO hybrid beamforming. We implement a mmWave MIMO OFDM framework to characterize the single-user MIMO and multi-user MIMO performance in indoor/outdoor environments. Our experiments reveal the need for multipath context-aware MIMO mode adaptation. (ii) mmWave MIMO radar with uniform and non-uniform array layout. We implement a multi-phased-array radar with non-uniform array layout, and demonstrate its higher angular resolution in comparison with single array or uniform arrays.\n\nThe key contributions of M 3 can be summarized as follows: (i) Designing the data path to bridge programmable baseband processors with low-cost commodity phased array modules. (ii) Designing the control path to reconfigure and control the phased array with sub-\u00b5s latency. (iii) Restructuring the commodity 802.11ad radio into a massive MIMO mmWave radio/radar. (iv) Experimental verification of the M 3 architecture and performance, along with new measurement insights for mmWave MIMO radio/radar systems. To our knowledge, M 3 represents the first-of-its-kind programmable mmWave MIMO platform. We will follow the WARP project model [54] to make M 3 available to the wireless research community, through open-source hardware and paid fabrication/assembly services. The code, documentation and further information will be released through the project website, http://m3.ucsd.edu/sdr/.\n\n\n"}, {"paperid": "paper2", "title": "mm-FLEX: an open platform for millimeter-wave mobile full-bandwidth experimentation", "abstract": "Millimeter-Wave (mm-wave) technology is increasingly being considered for mobile devices and use cases such as vehicular communication. This requires suitable experimentation platforms to support systems-oriented research to tackle the multitude of problems and challenges of mm-wave communications in such environments. To this end, we introduce mm-FLEX, a flexible and modular open platform with real-time signal processing capabilities that supports a bandwidth of 2 GHz and is compatible with mm-wave standard requirements. mm-FLEX integrates an FPGA-based baseband processor with full-duplex capabilities together with mm-wave RF front-ends and phased antenna arrays that are fully configurable from the processor in real-time. To demonstrate the capabilities of mm-FLEX, we implement a scalable, ultra-fast beam alignment mechanism for IEEE 802.11ad systems. It is based on compressive estimation of the signal's angle-of-arrival by means of switching through multiple receive beam patterns on a nano-second time-scale while receiving a packet preamble. Our implementation is open source and is made publicly available to the research community.", "introduction": "\n\nMillimeter-Wave (mm-wave) network technology such as the IEEE 802.11ad [33] and the upcoming IEEE 802.11ay [34] standards for 60 GHz Wireless Local Area Networks (WLANs) can provide vastly higher data rates than networks operating below 6 GHz, due to the large amount of bandwidth available at mm-wave frequencies.\n\nMm-wave devices typically implement directional communication using phased arrays, so that the beam-forming gains of the antenna compensate for the higher path loss due to the small wavelength [22]. This not only ensures a good link range but also reduces interference and thus improves spatial reuse. Operating networks at mm-wave frequencies introduces new problems not only due to the RF front-end components but also due to the need for high gain directional communication and the associated beam training or channel estimation. Especially for mobile scenarios, further practical research is needed. For instance, fast device tracking is essential for continuous antenna beam alignment, but current beam training mechanisms introduce a high overhead and latency when used in highly mobile environments. At the same time, there is a lack of suitable experimentation platforms that allow for realtime packet processing and antenna reconfiguration, and that are flexible enough to support modifications of the physical and MAC layers. To address the challenges of mobile mm-wave communication networks, it is crucial to provide the research community with such an experimentation platform, that ideally should have the following features: i) giga-sampling rate capability, to be able to accurately study the characteristics of the wide-band channels and be compatible to current standards, ii) access to physical layer data, which brings invaluable information to researchers to measure the channel and develop new signal processing algorithms, iii) simplicity, flexibility and configurability, such that researchers can easily modify the behavior of the system, iv) fast antenna reconfiguration to support high-mobility scenarios, and v) affordability, to enable also smaller research groups to carry out mobile systems research. The latter is a problem specific to mm-wave systems and their large bandwidth, since the cost of the A/D converters and the FPGA are directly related to the maximum sampling frequency and the number of logic elements/speed grade, respectively. Different solutions in the literature aim to address the need for experimentation platforms. The MiRa platform [2] uses Universal Software Radio Peripheral (USRP) devices as baseband equipment attached to a custom 28 GHz RF front-end. It only supports narrowband channels due to the USRP's bandwidth limitations. The X60 testbed [23] is based on National Instruments (NI) hardware and a phased array antenna kit. While it meets the bandwidth requirements of the IEEE 802.11ad standard, it is expensive and the high complexity of the design makes low-level modifications more difficult. OpenMili [35] aims to increase performance compared to [2] at a more manageable cost compared to [23]. It does provide better performance than [2] but still does not meet the bandwidth requirements of mm-wave standards. Our system is complementary to [36] which provides a MIMO-capable RF front-end, whereas our focus is on a full-bandwidth baseband design. In addition, the solutions listed above lack support for high-mobility scenarios, which require fast control over the antenna array to enable real-time beam steering with very low antenna reconfiguration latency.\n\nIn this paper we propose a Millimeter Wave Mobile FulL-Bandwidth EX perimentation Platform (mm-FLEX). It is a flexible, modular and highly configurable testbed that exceeds the requirements of current mm-wave standards, supporting more than 2 GHz of bandwidth. mm-FLEX is an open source research platform that offers a unique set of features. At approximately twice the cost of a high-end narrow-band USRP (an order of magnitude less than [23]), it offers more than ten times the performance and does not sacrifice standard compliance as [2,35]. Furthermore, we add important features such as fast real-time antenna steering that are a key enablers for research targeting high mobility scenarios.\n\nThe testbed is composed of a powerful baseband system including a high performance FPGA and processor boards with the necessary components for real-time signal processing, as well as a 60 GHz RF front-end using a 16+16 element phased array antenna with high resolution phase shifters that can be fully controlled from the system. We design mm-FLEX to be modular and flexible with the necessary IP blocks that facilitate real-time experimentation with mobile mm-wave systems. Furthermore, the designed blocks have a flexible AXI interface that allows different Super Sample Rate (SSR) configurations such that they can even be used on different FPGA platforms, such as the narrow-band X310 USRP system. We implement the signal processing blocks for real-time capture and frame processing directly on the FPGA 1 , together with the fast beam sweeping of the phased-array antenna at nano-second time scale. Our testbed also supports a hardware-in-the-loop mode where part of the functionality is software modeled while the time-critical ones are hardware-implemented, facilitating the development and validation of signal processing applications for the mm-wave community.\n\nWhile our experimentation platform is currently designed for IEEE 802.11ad, it is flexible enough to be used with 28GHz equipment [27] for 5G New Radio (NR) and beyond research.\n\nTo showcase the capabilities of mm-FLEX, we use it to address the important problem of fast beam alignment in dense, mobile mm-wave scenarios. Conventional IEEE 802.11ad [33] beam training is done by transmitting frames using each of the available antenna configurations, while the target device listens with a quasiomnidirectional beam pattern. This avoids the complexity of training both ends of the link simultaneously. The target device then provides feedback which sector resulted in the highest Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) [14]. Such brute force or simple hierarchical beam training (in case beam refinement is used) works well for relatively static deployments of moderate density. However, the overhead may become prohibitive when frequent beam training is required in more dynamic environments with device mobility or link interruptions through blocking obstacles.\n\nWe propose a design that eliminates dedicated station beam training to allow the network to handle very high network dynamics and client densities. Our mechanism works with unmodified standardcompliant IEEE 802.11ad Access Points (APs). While an AP sends multiple frames for the standard beam training, the stations perform quick signal strength measurements with different receive beam patterns during preamble reception of these frames after packet detection. We then use a fast sparse estimation algorithm to determine the Angle of Arrival (AoA) and select the best beam pattern to be used at the station. Our mechanism only requires minor changes in the firmware of the stations, since the fast beam-pattern sweeping capability is already included in 802.11ad standard compliant devices for the Beam Refinement Phase (BRP). We perform an extensive measurement campaign and show that our mechanism can switch through 10 receive beam patterns during the preamble without compromising detection accuracy for typical SNR values, whereas only 5 beam patterns are required to accurately estimate the AoA with an error of around 1 \u2022 .\n\nOverall, our paper provides the following contributions: \u2022 We design mm-FLEX, a flexible and configurable testbed that is able to perform real-time signal processing at multi-GHz bandwidths and is compatible with current mm-wave standards. At the same time, the hardware on which the system is based is affordable for such a high performance system. \u2022 We implement the baseband system on a powerful FPGA and processor board with dual AXI-stream data paths for separate transmitter and receiver chains. This brings modularity to the design and enables full-duplex applications. Our hardware processing blocks to detect and process the preamble of standard-compliant IEEE 802.11ad frames operates with the full bandwidth of 1.76 GHz. The code and specification of our testbed are publicly available [6].\n\n\u2022 We augment the testbed functionality to provide fast real-time antenna array reconfigurability, implementing a hardware block to directly switch beam patterns on a nano-second time scale, using a configurable input trigger. This is a crucial feature not only to support standard-compliant IEEE 802.11ad beam training, but more importantly to enable symbol-level beam reconfiguration for research targeting high-mobility scenarios.\n\n\u2022 We demonstrate the capabilities of the testbed platform by implementing a mechanism for passive station beam alignment for dense, mobile millimeter-wave networks, that significantly outperforms current standards and prior work.\n\n\n"}, {"paperid": "paper3", "title": "E-Eye: Hidden Electronics Recognition through mmWave Nonlinear Effects", "abstract": "While malicious attacks on electronic devices (e-devices) have become commonplace, the use of e-devices themselves for malicious attacks has increased (e.g., explosives and eavesdropping). Modern e-devices (e.g., spy cameras, bugs or concealed weapons) can be sealed in parcels/boxes, hidden under clothing or disguised with cardboard to conceal their identities (named as hidden e-devices hereafter), which brings challenges in security screening. Inspection equipment (e.g., X-ray machines) is bulky and expensive. Moreover, screening reliability still rests on human performance, and the throughput in security screening of passengers and luggages is very limited. To this end, we propose to develop a low-cost and practical hidden e-device recognition technique to enable efficient screenings for threats of hidden electronic devices in daily life. First, we investigate and model the characteristics of nonlinear effects, a special passive response of electronic devices under millimeter-wave (mmWave) sensing. Based on this theory and our preliminary experiments, we design and implement, E-Eye, an end-to-end portable hidden electronics recognition system. E-Eye comprises a low-cost (i.e., under $100), portable (i.e., 11.8cm by 4.5cm by 1.8cm) and light-weight (i.e., 45.5g) 24GHz mmWave probe and a smartphone-based e-device recognizer. To validate the E-Eye performance, we conduct experiments with 46 commodity electronic devices under 39 distinct categories. Results show that E-Eye can recognize hidden electronic devices in parcels/boxes with an accuracy of more than 99% and has an equal error rate (EER) approaching 0.44% under a controlled lab setup. Moreover, we evaluate the reliability, robustness and performance variation of E-Eye under various real-world circumstances, and E-Eye can still achieve accuracy over 97%. Intensive evaluation indicates that E-Eye is a promising solution for hidden electronics recognition in daily life.", "introduction": "\n\nHidden electronic devices (hereafter, e-devices) bring both security and privacy threats in our daily life. For instance, explosion tragedies continuously occur due to the ineffective detection of remote-controlled disguised bombs [1,3,7,14], which can be triggered by electronic initiators. Apart from these life-threatening hazards, e-devices (e.g., smartphones and spy camera) can also be used for eavesdropping, cheating in private zones [13] or accessing other areas that restrict electronics [4,15,16]. The fact that these e-devices (hereafter, hidden e-devices) can be sealed in parcels or boxes, hidden insides in clothing and disguised in appearance increases the risk that they can easily pass undetected through security check points.\n\nEntry security check is the current method for defending against malicious, hidden e-devices requiring an X-ray machine [58] at safety-critical sites (e.g., airports and embassy offices). Unfortunately, their expensive cost and poor portability make it an infeasible solution against the proliferation and the deployment of portable e-devices [45]. Moreover, the radiation emitted from X-rays is harmful to workers and persons passing through the checkpoints. Other scanning methods based on metal scanners can only detect the existence of the e-device rather than recognize the specific type directly (see Sec. 9.1). Conventional computer vision methods cannot be applied because the camera can not see through containers or bodies. Thermal imaging also fails because it only can detect the temperature of the hidden e-device [39], which can be easily interfered with by other heat sources. As a result, how to recognize hidden e-devices in a cost-efficient, user-friendly and non-invasive manner remains an unsolved challenge for public security and privacy.\n\nRecently, there is a rising trend of applying radio-frequency signals, such as millimeter wave (mmWave [10]), in sensing and tracking applications, because mmWave can penetrate obstacles and \"image\" hidden objects due to its highly-directional beamforming and strong reflection properties on objects [64]. For example, Adib et al. studied the possibility of sensing human occurrence and vitals through WiFi signals [17]. Zhu et al. developed a 60GHz mmWave imager for object detection and classification [66]. Wei et al. designed mTrack, a mmWave instrument for precision object tracking [64]. However, existing works mainly target either human or non-electronic object detection and tracking. The capability of accurately recognizing hidden electronic devices through mmWave sensing is unknown.\n\nTo this end, we propose our system, E-Eye, to facilitate hidden e-device recognition in public security inspections. Its features are (1) cost-efficient: the cost of the solution is affordable in daily life for large scale deployment; (2) portable: it is easy to use in the inspection of different containers (e.g., delivery boxes, checkin luggages or even human body) and various environments (e.g., postal offices, airports or factories); (3) non-invasive: it can avoid the obtrusive (even illegal) opening of the container in real practice which sacrifices efficiency and may cause privacy issues.\n\nThe foundation of E-Eye rests on the nonlinear response effect from electronic circuits when probed by the mmWave. The intrinsic difference in circuits' hardware characteristics (e.g., a circuits' components and circuit layout) generates a distinct nonlinear response, which can serve as the identity of a certain e-device brand. This way, we enable a novel sensing modality for noninvasive and cost-effective hidden e-devices recognition based on the mmWave field. Specifically, we design and prototype a portable (11.8cm \u00d7 4.5cm \u00d7 1.8cm) and light-weight (45.4\u0434) 24GHz mmWave probe device which is enabled to probe the mmWave and capture the returned nonlinear responses. We address the challenges in noiseisolation and coherence to achieve high-quality signal with low complexity and cost (less than US $100). Afterwards, the signal is transferred to the smartphone and we propose the wavelet-based analysis module taking into consideration the unavoidable variance in the signal's scaling and magnitude in practical usage. Eventually, we develop a fine-tuned support vector machine (SVM) classifier for robust recognition under various conditions. In the experiment, we employ 46 e-devices and the comprehensive results show that E-Eye can accurately recognize each e-device brand under different scenarios.\n\nOur contributions are summarized as follows:\n\n\u2022 We propose a novel form of recognizing hidden e-devices by exploring the nonlinear response effect of mmWave of e-devices. We find that the circuit inside an e-device acts as a passive signal modulator which reflects back radio frequency (RF) signals with intrinsic identity information. \u2022 We develop E-Eye, an end-to-end system to facilitate the low-cost, non-invasive and robust hidden electronics recognition. We prototype the sensing hardware and implement the recognition algorithm for efficient and effective classification. There are usually two following forms of radio frequency (RF) response when probing a continuous wave (CW) with the transmit frequency f 0 towards a target.\n\nLinear Effects: The main carrier frequency of the received signal is the same as that of the transmitted signal. The phase change in the linearly demodulated signals is related to the geometrical information, such as object distance, shape and size [42]. However, these linear effects do not reflect the material properties and we need to seek other information in the application of e-device detection and recognition.\n\nNonlinear Effects: Besides the main carrier frequency, the received signal wave is also modulated with a set of the sub-carrier frequencies with more side lobes in the spectrum. These sub-carrier frequencies are generated due to the nonlinear properties of the target (e.g., material reflection efficiency) [48,49]. In the remaining part of this section, we provide an in-depth analysis of non-linear effects in recognizing electronics.\n\nNonlinear Effects from E-device: As shown in Figure 2, when the e-device enters the RF beam field, chips, connectors and metal traces of printed circuit board (PCB) on an e-device are viewed as an array of antennas in the resolution of mmWave, and these antenna with inductance (L), capacitance (C) and resistance (R) act as a passive processor and manipulates the transmit mmwave signals. More specifically, antennas can conduct and transform the mmWave signal to a high-frequency current along the conductors between the electronic components within the device [38]. The components (e.g., a diode) or parasitic parameters (e.g., a parasitic circuit) on the PCB modulate the response signal and generate the nonlinear distortion [33], formulated as Equation (1):\nr (t) = m(z(t),\u00e2(t)) \u2297 h f (t),(1)\nwhere z(t) is the response signal, m(\u00b7,\u00e2(t)) is the nonlinear modulation function of the PCB,\u00e2(t) is the complex power-series for the nonlinear system, \u2297 stands for convolution computing and h f (t) is the ideal bandpass filter function for the carrier bandwidth [26,27]. After the modulated signal radiate from the e-device, they would be captured by the probe receive (Rx) antenna. Thus, this nonlinear response of the e-device contains rich information of its physical characteristic and holds the potential to serve as the device's identity. Figure 2: The e-device generates a nonlinear response signature under the RF beam. The response is determined by its intrinsic physical characteristics.\n\n\n"}, {"paperid": "paper4", "title": "Soli: ubiquitous gesture sensing with millimeter wave radar", "abstract": "This paper presents Soli , a new, robust, high-resolution, low-power, miniature gesture sensing technology for human-computer interaction based on millimeter-wave radar.

Radar operates on the principle of reflection and detection of radio frequency (RF) electromagnetic waves [Skolnik 1962]. The RF spectrum has several highly attractive properties as a sensing modality for interactive systems and applications: the sensors do not depend on lighting, * This research was supported by a Multi-University Research Agreement with Google while the author was a student at Stanford University.

When implemented at millimeter-wave RF frequencies, the entire sensor can be designed as a compact solid-state semiconductor device: a radar chip that is a miniature, low-power device having no moving parts and can be manufactured inexpensively at scale. The resulting Soli sensor delivers the promise of truly ubiquitous gesture interaction across a very broad range of applications, including but not limited to virtual reality (VR), wearables and smart garments, Internet of Things (IoT) and game controllers, as well as more traditional devices such as mobile phones, tablets and laptops.\n\nIt is important to point out that the first radar systems were developed as early as the 1930s [Watson-Watt 1945], and that RF sensing has since become a well established and mature field of engineering and applied science. The current radar hardware and computational methods, however, were primarily developed for mainstream radar applications, which usually involve detection and tracking of large moving objects at large distances, such as air and terrestrial traffic control, marine radar, aircraft anti-collision systems and outer space surveillance, and geophysical monitoring, among many others. The engineering requirements for such applications are not compatible with modern consumer applications in which sensors must fit into tiny mobile and wearable devices, run on limited computational resources, work at ultra-short distances (i.e. less than 5 mm), consume little power, and track the dynamic configuration of complex, highly deformable elastic objects, such as a human hand as opposed to a rigid airplane, at sub-millimeter accuracy. We are not aware of any existing radar system that could satisfy the above requirements. Our investigation suggests that developing a radar-based sensor optimized for human-computer interaction (HCI) requires re-thinking and re-building the entire sensor architecture from the ground up, starting with basic principles.\n\nIn this work, we present the first end-to-end radar sensing system specifically designed for tracking and recognizing fine hand gestures. Our work builds upon a large existing body of knowledge in the radar domain and, for the first time, explores the comprehensive design principles, implementation, and optimization of these tools for scalable gesture sensing within the constraints and requirements of modern HCI. We show that ubiquitous and intuitive gesture in-teraction is made possible through tailored, interdependent design of the entire sensor architecture, from the radar sensing paradigm (Sections 3 and 4) to hardware and solid-state radar chips (Section 5), interaction models (Section 6), gesture tracking techniques and vocabularies ( Figure 1 and Section 7), and software pipelines (Section 8). The complete end-to-end design, development, and evaluation of this new gesture sensing modality is the major achievement and contribution of this work, opening new research frontiers in non-imaging sensors for interaction.\n\n\n"}]
