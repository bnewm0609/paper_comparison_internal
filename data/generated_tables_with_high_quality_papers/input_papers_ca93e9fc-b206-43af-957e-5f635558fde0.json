[{"paperid": "paper0", "title": "Multi-Behavioral Sequential Prediction with Recurrent Log-Bilinear Model", "abstract": "With the rapid growth of Internet applications, sequential prediction in collaborative filtering has become an emerging and crucial task. Given the behavioral history of a specific user, predicting his or her next choice plays a key role in improving various online services. Meanwhile, there are more and more scenarios with multiple types of behaviors, while existing works mainly study sequences with a single type of behavior. As a widely used approach, Markov chain based models are based on a strong independence assumption. As two classical neural network methods for modeling sequences, recurrent neural networks cannot well model short-term contexts, and the log-bilinear model is not suitable for long-term contexts. In this paper, we propose a Recurrent Log-BiLinear (RLBL) model. It can model multiple types of behaviors in historical sequences with behavior-specific transition matrices. RLBL applies a recurrent structure for modeling long-term contexts. It models several items in each hidden layer and employs position-specific transition matrices for modeling short-term contexts. Moreover, considering continuous time difference in behavioral history is a key factor for dynamic prediction, we further extend RLBL and replace position-specific transition matrices with time-specific transition matrices, and accordingly propose a Time-Aware Recurrent Log-BiLinear (TA-RLBL) model. Experimental results show that the proposed RLBL model and TA-RLBL model yield significant improvements over the competitive compared methods on three datasets, i.e., Movielens-1M dataset, Global Terrorism Database and Tmall dataset with different numbers of behavior types.", "introduction": "\n\nN OWADAYS, Collaborative Filtering (CF) [14] plays an important role in a large number of applications, e.g., recommender systems, information retrieval and social network analysis. Conventional CF methods focus on modeling users preference based on their historical choices of items and always ignore the sequential information. It is reasonable to assume that user preferences change with his or her behavioral sequence. Meanwhile, rather than with merely one type of behaviors, e.g., purchasing in e-commerce and clicking on websites, there are many sequential scenarios with multiple types of behaviors towards items, e.g., clicking, purchasing, adding to favorites in e-commerce and downloading, using, uninstalling in app usage. Accordingly, it is necessary to model multi-behavioral sequences and collaboratively predict what a user will prefer next under a specific behavior. For instance, multiple types of behaviors, i.e., posting, sharing and commenting, on social media has been separately modeled and studied recently, which makes great contribution to user interest detection [47]. Besides ecommerce and other Internet applications, multi-behavioral sequential prediction can be implemented for social good, such as predicting security events in a specific area [21] [41] or predicting air quality [48]. Nowadays, some efforts have been put into developing CF methods with sequential information [3] [21] [33] [40] [46]. To the best of our knowledge, none of existing methods are designed for modeling sequences with multiple types of behaviors. And if we directly treat different behaviors towards one item as different elements in sequences, or simply ignore the differences among behaviors, conventional methods will have difficulty in revealing the correlations among behaviors and items. As shown in the example of app usage in Figure 1, different behaviors reveal users' different attitudes towards apps. Downloading and using means you may like the app, while uninstalling means you do not like the app and similar ones should not be recommended. So, it is essential to find a proper way to reveal the correlations among behaviors and items.\n\nMoreover, existing methods still have their own limitations even for single-behavioral sequences. Markov Chain (MC) based models [44] [33] [30] have become the most popular methods for sequential prediction. MC based models aim to predict the users' next behavior based on the past behaviors. A transition matrix is estimated, which can give the probability of an action based on the previous ones. However, a major problem of MC based models is that all the components are independently combined, indicating that it makes strong independence assumption among multiple factors [40].\n\nRecently, Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) have been successfully employed to model temporal dependency for different applications, such as sentence modeling tasks [23] [24] [25], video modeling [8], sequential click prediction [46] and location prediction [21]. When modeling the sequential data, RNN assumes that the temporal dependency changes monotonously along with positions in a sequence. This Taking app usage prediction as an example of multi-behavioral sequential prediction. This example shows a user's behaviors towards apps in an hour, including downloading, using and uninstalling. We can predict what app the user is going to download or use next. means that, one element, e.g., a word, a frame and a product, in a sequence usually has more significant effect than the previous one for prediction. Such rules may well model words in a sentence or frames in a video, since adjacent words or frames have significant correlation. The larger the distance between two words or two frames, the smaller the correlation. However, for behavior prediction tasks, this assumption does not confirm to complex real situations, especially for the most recent elements in historical sequences. Sometimes, several most recent elements have similar effects on users' next behavior. For instance, if you went to a gym, a restaurant and a shopping market yesterday morning, afternoon and evening respectively, these three behaviors may have similar effects on your behaviors today. Sometimes, most recent elements have more complex effects on the future. For instance, going to a gym yesterday has dominant effects on how you exercise today, and what you ate at a restaurant yesterday or what you bought at a shopping market yesterday can affect what you want to eat today a lot. There is no guarantee that one element has more or less significant effect than the previous one. The effects of most recent elements in modeling human behaviors are much more complicated than that in modeling sentences or videos. But RNN can only tell us that behaviors in yesterday morning have more significant effects than behaviors in yesterday afternoon, and behaviors in yesterday afternoon have more significant effects than behaviors in yesterday evening. Accordingly, we can say that, RNN cannot well model short-term contexts in a sequence.\n\nDifferent from the recurrent architecture in RNN based language models [23] [24] [25], the Log-BiLinear (LBL) model [27] represents each word in a sentence, i.e., each position in a sequence, with a specific matrix. It can better model the complex situations of local contexts in sequences. But when the sequence is too long, a maximal length is usually set. And in real behavior prediction scenarios, length of behavioral sequences is usually not fixed. So, LBL cannot well model long-term contexts in a sequence. Furthermore, time difference between input elements, e.g., continuous time difference between apps that the user has behaviors on in Figure 1, is another key factor in sequential modeling. However, to our best knowledge, none of existing models, including above MC based methods, RNN and LBL, can jointly model sequential information and time difference information in one framework.\n\nIn this paper, to overcome above shortcomings of conventional methods and model multi-behavioral sequences, we propose two novel sequential prediction methods, i.e., Recurrent Log-BiLinear (RLBL) model and Time-Aware Recurrent Log-BiLinear (TA-RLBL) model. First, to capture the properties of different types of behaviors in historical sequences, we employ behavior-specific transition matrices in our model. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work which is designed for predicting multi-behavioral sequences Second, we design RLBL model as a recurrent architecture to capture long-term contexts in sequences. It models several elements in each hidden layer and uses position-specific transition matrices to capture short-term contexts of the historical sequence. Our RLBL not only can model the subtle characteristics of the most recent items in a sequence, but also can deal with long-term contexts with a recurrent structure. Third, we further extend the RLBL model based on time difference information, and propose the TA-RLBL model. Rather than specific matrices for each position in RLBL, we use specific matrices, i.e., time-specific transition matrices, for each time difference value between input elements in TA-RLBL. Since it is difficult to estimate matrices for all the continuous time difference values, we divide all the possible temporal values into discrete bins. For a specific time difference value in one time bin, we can calculate the corresponding transition matrix via a linear interpolation of transition matrices of the upper bound and lower bound. Incorporating continuous time difference information, TA-RLBL can further improve the performance of RLBL.\n\nThe main contributions of this work are listed as follows:\n\n\u2022 We firstly address the problem of multi-behavioral sequential prediction, which is a significant problem in sequential prediction. And we use behaviorspecific matrices to represent the effects of different types of behaviors.\n\n\n"}, {"paperid": "paper1", "title": "Micro Behaviors: A New Perspective in E-commerce Recommender Systems", "abstract": "The explosive popularity of e-commerce sites has reshaped users\u00bb shopping habits and an increasing number of users prefer to spend more time shopping online. This evolution allows e-commerce sites to observe rich data about users. The majority of traditional recommender systems have focused on the macro interactions between users and items, i.e., the purchase history of a customer. However, within each macro interaction between a user and an item, the user actually performs a sequence of micro behaviors, which indicate how the user locates the item, what activities the user conducts on the item (e.g., reading the comments, carting, and ordering) and how long the user stays with the item. Such micro behaviors offer fine-grained and deep understandings about users and provide tremendous opportunities to advance recommender systems in e-commerce. However, exploiting micro behaviors for recommendations is rather limited, which motivates us to investigate e-commerce recommendations from a micro-behavior perspective in this paper. Particularly, we uncover the effects of micro behaviors on recommendations and propose an interpretable Recommendation framework RIB, which models inherently the sequence of mIcro Behaviors and their effects. Experimental results on datasets from a real e-commence site demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework and the importance of micro behaviors for recommendations.", "introduction": "\n\nThe modern e-commerce sites such as Amazon 1 and eBay 2 offer hundreds of millions of products for sale. For example, as on June 20th, 2017, Amazon has more than 372 million products 3 . It has become increasingly challenging for consumers to find their interested items. Recommender systems play a crucial role in mitigating this information overload problem by suggesting products that have potentials to fit consumers' needs. They have been proven to not only help increase customer satisfaction and create customer loyalty [34] but also boost many aspects of e-commerce services such as revenue and growth [24].\n\nMeanwhile, the popularity of e-commerce sites has reshaped users' shopping habits and users prefer to spend more time shopping online. For example, on average, American parents spend 7 hours per week on e-commerce sites 4 . This evolution enables ecommerce sites to observe rich data about their users. Figure 1 illustrates a real example of observed data on a user from an ecommerce site in a short period. The user first enters a page of iPhone 7 from searching result page. She reads the detailed description, as well as others' comments and adds it to the cart. Then she shifts to a page of iPhone 6 from the searching result page and reads the comments. After that, she browses a page of iPhone 7 cases from the sale page and orders the case. Finally, she jumps to a page of Samsung Galaxy from the home page of the e-commerce site. From a macro perspective as shown in the top subfigure in Figure 1, the user interacted with iPhone 7, iPhone 6, iPhone 7 cases and Samsung Galaxy. While from a micro perspective as shown in the bottom subfigure, each macro interaction includes a sequence of behaviors that can indicate how the user located the product page (e.g., the search engine or the sale promotion), whether the user clicks detailed information about a product (e.g., comments, or specifications), whether a user carts or orders a product, and how long the user dwells on a product. In this work, we refer these behaviors in macro interactions as micro-behaviors. These micro behaviors can provide fine-grained understandings about users. For example, locating a product from searching could indicate stronger intents than from the e-commerce homepage; and longer dwell time on a product suggests more interests in the product than shorter dwell time. Hence, exploiting micro behaviors has immense potential to advance recommender systems. However, such research is rather limited in the literature.\n\nIn this paper, we investigate e-commerce recommendations from the micro-behavior perspective where (a) data of a user is inherently viewed as a sequence of macro interactions between users and items; and (b) each macro interaction between a user and an item includes a sequence of micro behaviors as shown in Figure 1. One major advantage of the new perspective is -it provides a unified setting that makes various settings of existing recommender systems become its special cases:\n\n\u2022 if we completely ignore the sequential information of macro interactions and their micro-behaviors, macro interactions can be denoted as an user-item matrix, which is the typically setting for traditional collaborative filtering [29]; \u2022 when we completely ignore the sequential information of macro interactions but consider certain micro behaviors in macro interactions, our setting is boiled down to traditional collaborative filtering with implicit feedback from certain micro behaviors such clicks [12] and dwell time [35]; and \u2022 when we only consider the sequential information of macro interactions in a session and ignore micro-behaviors within macro interactions, the studied problem become sessionbased recommendations [14,15,31].\n\nOn the other hand, it also poses tremendous challenges including (1) how to model sequential information and (2) how to capture effects from a variety of micro behaviors. Solutions to these two challenges lead to a novel recommendation framework. Our major contributions are summarizas follows:\n\n\u2022 We uncover the effects of micro behaviors on e-commerce recommendations; \u2022 We provide a principled approach to capture the sequence of various micro behaviors mathematically; \u2022 We propose an interpretable Recommendation framework from the mIcro Behavior perspective RIB, which incorporates the sequence of micro behaviors and their corresponding effects into a coherent model; and\n\n\u2022 We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework and the importance of micro behaviors on data from a real e-commerce site. The rest of this paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we formally define the problem. We perform preliminary data analysis on micro behaviors in Section 3. In Section 4, we detail the proposed framework RIB. Experimental results with discussions are presented in Section 5. In Section 6, we briefly review related work. Finally we conclude our work and discuss the future work in Section 7.\n\n\n"}, {"paperid": "paper2", "title": "Learning from History and Present: Next-item Recommendation via Discriminatively Exploiting User Behaviors", "abstract": "In the modern e-commerce, the behaviors of customers contain rich information, e.g., consumption habits, the dynamics of preferences. Recently, session-based recommendations are becoming popular to explore the temporal characteristics of customers' interactive behaviors. However, existing works mainly exploit the short-term behaviors without fully taking the customers' long-term stable preferences and evolutions into account. In this paper, we propose a novel Behavior-Intensive Neural Network (BINN) for next-item recommendation by incorporating both users' historical stable preferences and present consumption motivations. Specifically, BINN contains two main components, i.e., Neural Item Embedding, and Discriminative Behaviors Learning. Firstly, a novel item embedding method based on user interactions is developed for obtaining an unified representation for each item. Then, with the embedded items and the interactive behaviors over item sequences, BINN discriminatively learns the historical preferences and present motivations of the target users. Thus, BINN could better perform recommendations of the next items for the target users. Finally, for evaluating the performances of BINN, we conduct extensive experiments on two real-world datasets, i.e., Tianchi and JD. The experimental results clearly demonstrate the effectiveness of BINN compared with several state-of-the-art methods.", "introduction": "\n\nRecommender system, as an essential component of modern ecommerce websites, tries to predict what the most suitable products or services are of users, based on the users' preferences [30]. With the mechanism development of e-commerce, a massive amount of customer interactions (e.g., browse, click, collect, cart, purchase) have been logged, which imply luxuriant consumption patterns. These information-rich logs provide opportunities for understanding customers' historical stable preferences and also their present consumption motivations, which may further contribute to smarter recommendations.\n\nAlong this line, there is a particular interest in understanding interactive behaviors of customers. Existing works can be concluded into two main paradigms. The first paradigm is the general recommenders. These works focus on mining the static relevancy between users and items from interactions, which are represented by the traditional collaborative filtering models [18,22,40]. For example, Zhang et al. made recommendations through a factorization model with different item semantic representations from the knowledge base [40]. However, most of these works have taken user-item specific relationships into consideration from the static views but neglect the dynamics and evolutions of users' preferences implied in sequential interactions. The other paradigm is recommending next items based on sequential pattern mining [34,39] or transition modeling [29,42]. Along this line, researchers recently show more interest in an e-commerce scenario where user profiles are invisible so that recommender systems are developed based on the user interactions in short sessions [15,19,27]. These session-based models have provided the comprehension about users' decision-making process in a short term, but the dynamics of preferences [38] and how to perfectly integrate both the historical stable preferences with present consumption motivations are still largely unexplored.\n\nActually, as a user's interactive behaviors naturally form a behavioral sequence over time, the user's historical preferences from the long-term view and present motivations or demands from the short-term view can be dynamically revealed. For instance, Figure 1 illustrates a typical online shopping scenario. The user's historical interactions imply that this user might be a \"Star Wars\" fan since that the user has bought or collected various spin-off products of the \"Star Wars\". Moreover, we infer that this user would like to buy dark T-shirts because a black shirt is included in the personal cart and the user has browsed many short sleeve shirts. However, following the general collaborative filtering approaches, another spin-off product may be recommended since all the preference behaviors of the user's entire history are exploited in the static manners as shown in the blue chart of Figure 1. By contraries, if we only consider the current session behaviors of this user in accordance with what the session-based models do, another similar or popular shirt would be recommended as shown in the green chart of Figure 1. Actually, by exploiting both the historical stable preferences and present consumption motivations of this user, more attention should be paid to short sleeve shirts and the \"Star Wars\" graphic T-shirts perfectly match user's tastes. Therefore, we can conclude that a smarter recommender system should not only consider users' historical stable preferences but also take into account the present consumption motivations by discriminatively exploiting different terms or types of user behaviors.\n\nBased on the intuition and observations, we propose a novel solution framework called Behavior-Intensive Neural Network (BINN) to address the next-item recommendation problem. Our BINN framework contains two main components: Neural Item Embedding and Discriminative Behaviors Learning. Specially, we propose a novel neural item embedding method to obtain a unified item representation space for learning latent vectors which could capture the sequential similarities between items. Different from the traditional item embedding methods which are based on inherent features such as item images or text descriptions, our neural item embedding method generates item representations by means of exploiting users' collaborative sequential interactions over items directly. Then, with the item embedded, we design two different behavior alignments, i.e., Session Behaviors Learning and Preference Behaviors Learning to respectively model users' present consumption motivations and historical stable preferences by discriminatively exploring interactive behaviors of users. Specific to the alignments, we respectively develop two deep neural network architectures to jointly learn the session behaviors and preference behaviors. Finally, by matching the potentially preferred items in the latent space, BINN generates recommendations for the target users. For evaluating the performances of BINN, we conduct extensive experiments on two real-world datasets. The experimental results clearly demonstrate the effectiveness of BINN compared with several state-of-the-art methods. In summary, the main contributions of this study can be summarized as follows.\n\n\u2022 We propose to make item-recommendation by integrating both the historical preferences and present motivations of users, which are all learned from the users' interactive behaviors.\n\n\u2022 We propose a novel Behavior-Intensive Neural Network (BINN) which includes embedding items by users' interactions and discriminative behavior alignments accompanied by two applicable neural network architectures.\n\n\u2022 We conduct extensive experiments on two real-world datasets.\n\nThe results show that BINN model outperforms other state-ofthe-art methods from various aspects.\n\n\n"}, {"paperid": "paper3", "title": "Modeling Contemporaneous Basket Sequences with Twin Networks for Next-Item Recommendation", "abstract": "Our interactions with an application frequently leave a heterogeneous and contemporaneous trail of actions and adoptions (e.g., clicks, bookmarks, pur-chases). Given a sequence of a particular type (e.g., purchases)\u2013 referred to as the target sequence, we seek to predict the next item expected to appear beyond this sequence. This task is known as next-item recommendation. We hypothesize two means for improvement. First, within each time step, a user may interact with multiple items (a basket), with potential latent associations among them. Second, predicting the next item in the target sequence may be helped by also learning from another support-ing sequence (e.g., clicks). We develop three twin network structures modeling the generation of both target and support basket sequences.

We shop at marketplaces such as Amazon or Alibaba; order meals from Uber Eats, stream music over Spotify or Pandora; get our screen time fix from Netflix or YouTube; etc. Consequently, some of us knowingly, while others unwittingly, are leaving our digital footprints, tracing the pages or activities where we have been. Some services, such as Foursquare, might in some cases even be able to approximate literal (walking) footprints based on check-ins.\n\nImportantly, these traces from the past may well contain prescient signals of where we are headed in the future, in terms of our adoptions or consumptions. Hence, an important problem of wide interest and implication in both industry and academia is that of next-item recommendation. Based on historical data of consumers' activities, we would like to predict a new item that a consumer will likely adopt next.\n\nBroadly, there are several main directions in the literature. One direction is collaborative filtering, whereby recommen-dations are driven by users' personalized preferences [Koren et al., 2009]. Another direction is content-based recommendation, whereby recommendations are driven by similarity in content among items [Pazzani and Billsus, 2007]. Yet another direction is sequential preference, whereby recommendations are driven by latent dependencies between the next item and other items that a user has adopted at previous occasions.\n\nProblem. We focus on sequential preference. There are scenarios where future actions are influenced by past actions. For one example, music streaming services are interested in generating coherent playlists, which requires paying attention to sequential transitions between songs [Chen et al., 2012]. For another, the topics that Tweeters post tend to exhibit a sequential nature [Li et al., 2016]. So is recommending courses, where there are progression over time and precedence relationships [Parameswaran et al., 2010]. As each user is commonly associated with a sequence, the essence of this paradigm is learning sequentiality among items across users' sequences, rather than personalization per se.\n\nRecent works on sequential recommendation are based on Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) [Lipton et al., 2015] (see Section 2). However, direct application of RNN to sequential recommendation suffers from two major limitations in modeling choices. First, it models a sequence of one type of actions (e.g., only purchases). Second, it assumes that at each time step, there is only one action (e.g., one item purchased). However, these assumptions may not bear out in some scenarios. For one, there are multiple types of actions resulting from user interaction with a system. In an online marketplace, a user may click on various items under consideration, abandon most, add some to a shopping cart, and puts others on a wish list, before an eventual purchase takes place. In a video streaming service, a user may watch some trailers, follow through to watch some shows fully, and later on may rate or review some movies, of which a few might be rated highly. In each case, we are dealing with multiple sequence types (e.g., sequence of clicks and sequence of purchases). Importantly, these sequence types are contemporaneous, occurring within a common period of time, and may well be capturing some related underlying behaviors. For instance, to predict what one would purchase, it may be instructive to pay attention to not only what a user has purchased previously, but also what she has clicked in the past. Therefore, we postulate the need for modeling these contemporaneous sequences jointly.\n\nFor another, we are not always dealing with a strict ordering of individual items. More frequently, we deal with groups or sessions, whereby there may be sequentiality from one session to another, but the ordering within a session may not be informative. For example, when planning travel, one day we may be searching for airfare, while on another day we may be booking accommodations. When grocery shopping, we may buy for different meal plans on different days. Though not necessarily sequentially ordered, items within a session are probably correlated to some degree, e.g., items of the same meal plan. We refer to such a group or session as \"basket\".\n\nApproach. To address those limitations, we propose to model contemporaneous basket sequences. In this work, we focus on a pair 1 of sequence types: target and support. The target sequence refers to high-quality, high-value, and possibly sparser interactions (e.g., purchases) for which we wish to predict the next interaction (e.g., next purchase). The support sequence refers to more frequent and informative interactions (e.g., clicks) that would be relevant for predicting the next target item. For example, if purchasing is the target, and clicking is the support, then we are predicting the next purchase by modeling sequence of purchases and sequence of clicks.\n\nWe explore dual-RNN structure to represent the two sequence types. Having been generated contemporaneously from the same ecosystem of interactions, the sequence types likely model related phenomena. Instead of two completely different RNN's, we base our Contemporaneous Basket Sequences or CBS framework on the concept of twin networks. Analogously to biological twins, they share some commonalities, but to different degrees in different cases. We develop three CBS architectures along the spectrum of commonalities. In all, the two sequence types share a basket encoder to capture in-basket associations among items. They vary in how much sharing occurs at the recurrent units. For CBS-SN (Siamese Networks), the sequence types share a recurrent encoder. For CBS-CFN (Concordant Fraternal Networks), they each have a different recurrent encoder with the same recurrent units. For CBS-DFN (Discordant Fraternal Networks), one sequence type has a recurrent encoder and the other does not, to model different scopes of sequential effects.\n\nContributions. As our first contribution, we hypothesize that modeling contemporaneous basket sequences could be beneficial for next-item recommendation due to synergies between the target and support sequences. As our second contribution, we develop three neural network architectures: CBS-SN, CBS-CFN and CBS-DFN, describe their design in Section 3, and note some learning details in Section 4.1. Our third contribution is to investigate research questions on the effectiveness of modeling contemporaneous basket sequences jointly on public datasets (see Section 4).\n\n\n"}, {"paperid": "paper4", "title": "Buying or Browsing?: Predicting Real-time Purchasing Intent using Attention-based Deep Network with Multiple Behavior", "abstract": "E-commerce platforms are becoming a primary place for people to find, compare and ultimately purchase products. One of the fundamental questions that arises in e-commerce is to predict user purchasing intent, which is an important part of user understanding and allows for providing better services for both sellers and customers.

As an important part of user understanding, it is crucial to know whether a customer is buying or just browsing on an e-commerce application, as it allows for providing better services for both sellers and customers. From the perspective of the sellers, knowing users' current purchasing intent can increase their sales volume and profit margin. When the e-commerce platform has increased confidence that a subset of users are more likely to purchase, it can perform some proactive actions to maximize conversion based on this information. The platform may offer time-limited coupons or create bundles of complementary products to push the users to complete their purchases. From the perspective of the customers, recognizing users' current buying or browsing intent is vital for the e-commerce platform to set appropriate strategies for the recommendation system and search engine to improve user experience.\n\nPrevious studies focus on leveraging traditional user behavior, which we call browse-interactive behavior, to predict users' purchasing intent [15,18,19,23]. However, limited by the representation capability and frequency of occurrence of the browse-interactive behavior, e.g., browse, search or collect a product, it is hard to predict users' real-time purchasing intent depending solely on these actions. In other words, these actions contain insufficient information about user behavior patterns that would lead to a purchase in a short time. The purchase intent of a customer may slowly build over time and may not instantaneously lead to a purchase. As a result, it is challenging to identify the moment when the customer finally places the order. To this end, we need some more fine-grained behavior data to model user purchasing behavior patterns. In order to capture users' real-time purchasing intent, we collect a new type of interactive behavior data, which we call touchinteractive behavior. With the rapid development of hardware and software on mobile devices, we take advantage of the sensors and accelerometers of the mobile devices to automatically glean the real-time context of user interactions, such as the swipe and tap actions. Compared with the browse-interactive actions, the touchinteractive actions occur more frequently. As shown in Table 1, the number of swipe actions and tap actions generated per user per day are 37.7 times and 9.3 times more than that of the browseinteractive actions, respectively. As a result, the touch-interactive behavior contains more rich information about user behavior patterns. For example, we find that some customers would browse the product comments for a long time before they place the order. Such typical patterns can be easily captured by using the touchinteractive behavior. By combing the traditional browse-interactive behavior and the new touch-interactive behavior, we are able to model the user behavior patterns more comprehensively.\n\nHowever, there exist several challenges in predicting users' realtime purchasing intent. First, the touch-interactive behavior contains less semantic information than the browse-interactive behavior. Therefore, it is challenging to extract useful features from these data to improve the prediction performance. Second, it is necessary to figure out an effective fusion mechanism to combine the browseinteractive behavior and the touch-interactive behavior in order to bring their advantages into full play. Third, due to the complexity of the browsing behavior where the customers with different purchasing intent can appear to be very similar, it is essential to capture common features that can well depict the customers and unique features that would lead to different purchasing behavior.\n\nIn this paper, we propose a novel end-to-end deep network, named Deep Intent Prediction Network (DIPN), for the real-time purchasing intent prediction. In DIPN, the user behavior features are automatically learned from the raw data without the need of extensive feature engineering. In particular, we propose a hierarchical attention mechanism to fuse the views extracted from different interactive behavior sources. In the bottom attention layer, we design an intra-view attention mechanism which focuses on the inner parts of the behavior sequence. In the top attention layer, we propose an inter-view attention mechanism that learns the inter-view relations between different behavior sequences. In addition, we propose to train the real-time and long-term purchasing intent simultaneously with the same model. With the multi-task learning, DIPN can capture common features that well depict the customers and unique features that would lead to different purchasing behavior. The contribution of the paper can be summarized as follows:\n\n\u2022 We collect a new type of user behavior, the touch-interactive behavior, which contains rich information about user behavior patterns. Together with the traditional browse-interactive behavior, we are able to depict a user from different views for better performance of purchasing intent prediction. \u2022 We propose a deep network DIPN for real-time purchasing intent prediction. A novel hierarchical attention mechanism is proposed to fuse multiple views extracted from different interactive behavior sources. In addition, multi-task learning is introduced to better distinguish user behavior patterns. \u2022 We conduct extensive experiments to evaluate the performance of DIPN in both offline and online settings. Experimental results on a large-scale industrial dataset shows the superiority of DIPN in predicting purchasing intent. In particular, DIPN has been deployed in the operational system of Taobao and adopted in the coupon allocation task at a shopping festival.

On one hand, items (i.e. products) are usually organized hierarchically in categories, and correspondingly users' interests are naturally hierarchical on different granularity of items and categories. On the other hand, multiple granularity oriented recommendations become very popular in E-commerce sites, which require hierarchical user profiling in different granularity as well. In this paper, we propose HUP, a Hierarchical User Profiling framework to solve the hierarchical user profiling problem in E-commerce recommender systems. In HUP, we provide a Pyramid Recurrent Neural Networks, equipped with Behavior-LSTM to formulate users' hierarchical real-time interests at multiple scales. Furthermore, instead of simply utilizing users' item-level behaviors (e.g., ratings or clicks) in conventional methods, HUP harvests the sequential information of users' temporal finely-granular interactions (micro-behaviors, e.g., clicks on components of items like pictures or comments, browses with navigation of the search engines or recommendations) for modeling. Extensive experiments on two real-world E-commerce datasets demonstrate the significant performance gains of the HUP against state-of-the-art methods for the hierarchical user profiling and recommendation problems. We release the codes and datasets at https://github.com/guyulongcs/WSDM2020_HUP.", "introduction": "\n\nIn the era of Internet, recommender systems are playing crucial roles in various applications such as E-commerce portals (e.g. Amazon, JD.com, Alibaba), social networking websites like Facebook, video-sharing sites like Youtube, visual discovery sites like Pinterest and so on. In practice, User Profiling [5,11,18,24,33,38] is one of the most important phases in recommender systems. It yields profile vectors, which formally represent users' interests by deeply understanding their historical interactions, can be used for candidate generation [31,42], click-through rate prediction [4,39,40], conversion rate prediction [3,16] and long-term user engagement optimization [34][35][36][37][44][45][46].\n\nRecently, modeling users' hierarchical real-time interests is emerging to be a crucial issue in E-commerce recommender systems. Firstly, items (i.e. products) in E-commerce sites are typically organized in hierarchical catalogue. Correspondingly, users' interests naturally lie hierarchically on multiple granularity of items and categories. Secondly, different granularity of recommendations (e.g. item, topic and category) become very popular in E-commerce sites, and such scenarios require hierarchical user profiling in different  Figure 2: Hierarchical views of Micro behaviors of a user in JD.com granularity as well. For instance, Figure 1 illustrates a real example of hierarchical recommendations in Amazon. The left side of the figure recommends some items (mobile phones) to a user, while the right side shows a list of recommendations on the categories of \"phone accessories\", \"chargers\" and so on. Category recommendation can help the recommender systems quickly figure out the main interest of the user and make better recommendations.\n\nExisting user profiling methods mainly focus on item recommendations, usually based on users' item-level responses like ratings [20] or clicks [14]. Among existing methods, latent factor modeling is a popular branch, including matrix factorization [13,20,38], neural embedding [8,10], etc. Generally they learn a unified embedding for the target user to represent her interests on the items based on her historical behaviors. Recently, recurrent neural networks (RNN) have achieved state-of-the-art performance in session-based recommendations [14,29].\n\nExisting methods have the following limitations. First, when facing different granularity of recommendation tasks, most of them usually need to run a similar algorithm multiple times on different granularity of item organizations, where each run builds users' certain level profile vectors for the corresponding recommendation task, i.e., item-level profiles for item recommendations and categorylevel profiles for category recommendations. Correspondingly, the training process of each level's profile vectors is completely independent from the others. However, users' multiple-level interests are closely correlated. Figure 2 illustrates a user's hierarchical interests, including an item level and two category levels, with her historical behaviors. Resulting from the correlations between items and categories, improvement on one recommendation task might benefit others. However, to the best of our knowledge, such privilege has not been explored in existing methods.\n\nSecond, only harvesting the signals of users' item-level interactions like ratings and clicks is insufficient. In most of the Ecommerce portals, users provide finely-granular responses such as clicking and browsing different modules (e.g., comments and pictures) of items, adding to shopping carts and purchases, which are referred to as \"micro-behaviors\" [30,41]. For example, the bottom layer of Figure 2 presents a user's historical micro-behaviors in JD.com (one of the largest e-commerce site in the world), including browsing a pair of Nike shoes from the homepage, searching and reading specifications of iPhone 8, browsing Google Pixels 2 from the promoting page, searching iPhone X, reading comments and adding it into the shopping cart for purchasing, etc. Obviously, in comparison with users' item-level responses, micro-behaviors provide more detailed information, and preliminary studies [30,41] have demonstrated the advantage of modeling such detailed behaviors. However, to our best knowledge, none of existing methods has leveraged such advantages to improve the performance of multiplelevel user profiling.\n\nThird, generally users' interests are dynamic and continuously shifting. Some state-of-the-art methods like Time-LSTM [43] usually incorporate time intervals to track the interests shifting. However, we argue that besides the time intervals, the types of behaviors and their dwell time are also extremely important. As shown in Figure 2, we know that iPhone X is preferable to others, since various micro-behaviors are performed on iPhone X with long dwell time. We also observe that triggered by making an order on iPhone X, the user's interests on mobile phones drop sharply. Neglecting to model behavior types and dwell times, Time-LSTM would be in trouble to capture users' detailed preferences and interests shifting.\n\nTo cope with these challenges, we present HUP, a hierarchical user profiling framework to precisely formulate users' real-time interests on multiple organizations of items, targeting significant performance gains in recommendation accuracy. In particular, it models users' multiple-level interests with a Pyramid Recurrent Neural Networks, which typically consist of a micro layer, an item layer, and multiple category recurrent neural network layers. The micro layer harvests the detailed behavioral information and passes it to the higher layers, which could abstract users' hierarchical interests on the corresponding levels of the item organizations simultaneously. Furthermore, to sensitively track users' real-time interests, we introduce Behavior-LSTM in each layer, where a behavior gate is designed to model the types and dwell time of behaviors. Extensive experiments for item recommendation and category recommendation tasks have been conducted on two large-scale real e-commerce datasets to demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed approach.\n\nTo sum up, our major contributions are listed as follows:\n\n\u2022 We formulate a novel hierarchical user profiling problem, which aims to precisely model users' multiple level interests simultaneously in E-commerce recommender systems. \u2022 We present HUP, which exploits a Pyramid Recurrent Neural Networks for hierarchical user profiling based on users' historical micro-behaviors. \u2022 We propose Behavior-LSTM, which utilizes a behavior gate to model the types and dwell time of behaviors for effectively formulating users' real-time interests. \u2022 We conduct extensive experiments and prove that our method outperforms state-of-the-art baselines greatly on both item recommendation and category recommendation tasks.\n\n\n"}, {"paperid": "paper6", "title": "Modeling Multiple Coexisting Category-Level Intentions for Next Item Recommendation", "abstract": "Purchase intentions have a great impact on future purchases and thus can be exploited for making recommendations. However, purchase intentions are typically complex and may change from time to time. Through empirical study with two e-commerce datasets, we observe that behaviors of multiple types can indicate user intentions and a user may have multiple coexisting category-level intentions that evolve over time. In this article, we propose a novel Intention-Aware Recommender System (IARS) which consists of four components for mining such complex intentions from user behaviors of multiple types. In the first component, we utilize several Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) and an attention layer to model diverse user intentions simultaneously and design two kinds of Multi-behavior GRU (MGRU) cells to deal with heterogeneous behaviors. To reveal user intentions, we carefully design three tasks that share representations from MGRUs. The next-item recommendation is the main task and leverages attention to select user intentions according to candidate items. The remaining two (item prediction and sequence comparison) are auxiliary tasks and can reveal user intentions. Extensive experiments on the two real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our models compared with several state-of-the-art recommendation methods in terms of hit ratio and NDCG.", "introduction": "\n\nRecommender systems have become an essential component of online retail websites and aim to recommend items that a user will most likely to purchase in the future. With the fast development of e-commerce, these websites recorded a massive amount of heterogeneous interaction behaviors 23:2 Y. Xu et al. (e.g., view, cart, and purchase) between users and items. These interaction records provide opportunities for understanding user purchase intentions.\n\nAlong this line, recommendation with data of behaviors of multiple types (multi-behavior data for short) has attracted wide concerns. Existing studies leveraging multi-behavior data can be divided into two main categories. The first category is extending matrix factorization models. These studies aim to learn the relevance between users and items based on multiple interaction matrices [7,9,18,34]. However, these methods take user-item relationships into consideration from static views and neglect the evolution of users' intentions and the context of purchase behavior. The second kind of work recommends next items by mining sequential patterns or modeling dependency between items [17,35]. In these studies, researchers show more interest in mining the user intentions in short sessions for recommendation. But they model behaviors of different types independently and convert a sequence to a single latent vector which may fail to handle complex intentions.\n\nIn this article, we aim to exploit the multi-behavior data to mine user purchase intentions for the next-item recommendation. Behaviors are the ways (e.g., click, add-to-cart, purchase) that users interact with items on websites. Users usually have multiple kinds of behaviors (e.g., click many related items) before they finally buy a product. We find that behaviors of multiple types can indicate user intentions and users may have multiple coexisting purchase intentions on items of several categories through an empirical study (see details in Section 3). Intentions denote the purpose or goal of one purchase interaction. For example, a user wants to buy both a T-shirt and a pair of shorts (i.e., two kinds of intentions) when summer comes (see Figure 1). He may have click behaviors on products of the two categories alternately before he buys them. Therefore, users can have more than one intention simultaneously. If we can learn such latent complex user intentions from multi-behavior data with item category information and dynamically determine which intention is the most important for the purchase of next item, we will improve the recommendation performance greatly. For better modeling such multiple coexisting intentions based on interaction behaviors, our proposed model should satisfy the following several characteristics:\n\n\u2022 Exploiting Different Behaviors Discriminately. Behaviors of various types have different importance for indicating user intentions. Casual viewing behaviors may be generated with curiosity while purchasing behaviors usually confirm users' preference on items. Therefore, they should be exploited discriminately.\n\n\u2022 Reserving the Dependency among Behaviors of Diverse Types. On the one hand, the interaction data should be seen as sequences for retaining the dependency among items and evolving trends of user intentions. On the other hand, behaviors of different types should be seen as the context of adjacent behaviors rather than be utilized independently. \u2022 Modeling Multiples User Purchase Intentions Simultaneously. Previous research presents user intentions with a single latent vector which lacks the ability for modeling multiple intentions. Our approach should learn several intentions on item category levels simultaneously. Previous research usually mines user hidden intentions from interaction sequences of item IDs. But categories of items in interaction records can explicitly reflect user intentions which need to be further studied.\n\nTo achieve the above goals, we propose a novel neural network model named IARS to model user purchase intentions with the sequences of multiple kinds of behaviors. The model consists of four components, i.e., one RNN-based module and three task modules. The RNN-based module is used as one encoder to learn latent representations encoding user intentions from sequences of behaviors. It discriminately processes different behaviors using two proposed Multi-behavior Gated Recurrent Unit (MGRU) cells. In addition, for modeling users' multiple intentions, we utilize several RNNs to process behaviors simultaneously and adopt attention in recommendation to enable each RNN to learn different intentions. The other three modules are designed for solving diverse tasks based on the learned representations. The first task is to predict next item and category. The second task is to judge whether two sequences are of the same user and whether they are adjacent sequences. These two tasks are aimed to reveal user intentions from record levels and sequence levels, respectively. As far as we know, we are the first to propose sequence comparison tasks to improve recommendation performance. The third task is to estimate user preference over items which is the main task of our model. In this task, we utilize an attention layer to select user intentions according to candidate items.\n\nTo summarize, the main contributions of this article are as follows:\n\n\u2022 We conduct an empirical study on two real-world e-commerce datasets and observe that users have multiple coexisting category-level intentions in interaction sequences of diverse behaviors. \u2022 We propose a novel neural model named IARS to mine user complex intentions for recommendation. It includes several recurrent neural networks for learning latent multiple user intentions from behaviors and three diverse tasks. The various auxiliary behaviors are utilized to reveal user intentions before purchase behavior. Item category prediction task and sequence comparison task are proposed to further reveal user intentions. \u2022 We conduct experiments on the two real-world datasets. The results show that our model significantly outperforms other state-of-the-art methods from various aspects.\n\nThe remainder of this article is organized as follows: In Section 2, we first introduce related work. In Section 3, we analyze two real-world datasets and show several key observations. Next, we introduce our proposed models in Section 4. Then, we evaluate our models based on the two e-commerce datasets in Section 5.

However, the recently increasing focus on privacy concerns, such as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), can significantly affect the deployment of state-of-the-art sequential recommendation techniques, because user behavior data are no longer allowed to be arbitrarily used without the user\u2019s explicit permission. To address the issue, this paper proposes DeepRec, an on-device deep learning framework of mining interaction behaviors for sequential recommendation without sending any raw data or intermediate results out of the device, preserving user privacy maximally. DeepRec constructs a global model using data collected before GDPR and fine-tunes a personal model continuously on individual mobile devices using data collected after GDPR. DeepRec employs the model pruning and embedding sparsity techniques to reduce the computation and network overhead, making the model training process practical on computation-constraint mobile devices. Evaluation results show that DeepRec can achieve comparable recommendation accuracy to existing centralized recommendation approaches with small computation overhead and up to 10x reduction in network overhead.", "introduction": "\n\nWith the rapid growth and widespread adoption of smartphones and tablet computers, mobile commerce [3] is becoming the dominant form of e-commerce during recent years. It is forecasted that mobile commerce will outpace non-mobile commerce in 2021, accounting for more than half of total e-commerce sales [2]. The special characteristic of user interactions on mobile devices, i.e., accessing the Internet at any time and any location, advances mobile commerce to provide even more personalized experience than traditional e-commerce by leveraging the temporal or spatial information of user interaction behaviors to precisely recommend items. Among these efforts, sequential recommendation [11,25,26,33,61] is one of the most promising approaches because the user interactions on mobile devices are usually fragmented and momentary [30] and sequential recommendation can effectively work on a small scale of fragmented data. Just like many tasks where deep neural networks significantly improve the performance [9,23,32], state-ofthe-art sequential recommenders are mostly based on deep learning techniques [14,57].\n\nHowever, the enforcement of policies and legislation formulations to regulate the usage of privacy data, such as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) 1 \n\n\n"}, {"paperid": "paper8", "title": "MBN: Towards Multi-Behavior Sequence Modeling for Next Basket Recommendation", "abstract": "Next basket recommendation aims at predicting the next set of items that a user would likely purchase together, which plays an important role in e-commerce platforms.

In most real-world scenarios, users often purchase a basket of items during a visit to an e-commerce platform. Next basket recommendation (NBR), 81:2 Y. Shen et al.\n\nwhich aims at accurately predicting the set of items that a user would like to purchase in the next basket, is an essential task in recommender systems [39,46]. The NBR problem distinguishes itself from the conventional item recommendation in two aspects. First, NBR requires capturing item correlations among baskets. For example, items in the same basket can be correlated to each other (e.g., bread and milk) or dependent on the items purchased in the previous baskets. Second, NBR has to learn a user's sequential purchasing interest from previously purchasing basket sequence. However, item recommendation has focused on modeling static user and item characteristics and exploring their interaction mode [18]. To this end, the widely adopted collaborative filtering methods such as latent factor models [1,2,7,8,27,38] are thus inappropriate to recommend the next basket of items.\n\nA variety of NBR researches have emerged with success, which mainly include Markov Chain (MC)-based methods and Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) based methods. MC-based models [39,43], model user preference by the last K interaction(s) in a K-order MC, but ignore the other previous interactions. Recently, RNN has become a better choice in dealing with basket sequences, due to its impressive capability in modeling natural language sequences. RNN-based methods [4,16,29,30,34,46] leverage all the interactions in a long sequence of an anonymous user, capturing the user's temporal interaction patterns. These approaches have been verified to be effective in predicting the next purchasing basket, but they do not consider different behaviors.\n\nIn practice, users often interact with items in a variety of behaviors. In addition to purchasing items, a user may interact with items by clicking, adding to cart, tagging with favor, and so on. In fact, the temporal item interactions of a user with multiple behaviors can be naturally organized into separate basket sequences, as illustrated in Figure 1. It is important to notice that exploring the information from multi-behavior sequences is beneficial to the NBR for two reasons. First, a user would likely purchase an item after showing interest in it via clicking the item link or adding it to the cart. Hence, non-purchasing sequences shed light on user's potential purchasing intention, especially for the new items that have not been purchased before. Second, learning collective knowledge from multi-behavior sequences improves the understanding of user's true latent interest, reducing noises from accidentally purchased items. In this article, we focus on the following problem: given multiple basket sequences under distinct behaviors, how can we exploit multi-behavior knowledge to improve the accuracy of recommending next purchasing basket?\n\nIdeally, when modeling multi-behavior sequences, we would like to capture the latent and dynamic item correlations within and across sequences to disclose a user's purchasing habit, her general interest and the evolving pattern. While a line of researches [11-13, 23, 26, 35, 40, 42, 45, 47, 48] have studied the multi-behavior data, they focus on the typical recommendation task and treat multi-behavior data as auxiliary information to address the well-recognized data sparsity challenge. They are thus insufficient to solve the NBR problem due to the ignorance of temporal information and item correlations encoded in multi-behavior sequences. Another line of researches [15,28,32,33,37,49] developed RNN-based models over multi-behavior sequential data for next item or session-based recommendation. For example, BINN [32] uses a single RNN to deal with different behaviors mixedly. These approaches do not establish a direct connection among the past items interacted with different behaviors or explicitly modeling their relationship to the item set to be purchased next.\n\nTo tackle the problem, we conduct a comprehensive empirical study on real datasets to disclose the characteristics of multi-behavior sequences and comprehend the strengths and challenges of exploiting multi-behavior data for NBR. Based on our observations, we propose a novel Multi-Behavior Network (MBN) model that learns collective knowledge from multi-behavior sequences towards better recommendation results. Our model consists of three major components. The basket encoder is developed to capture item correlations within any basket in a sequence. The meta multi-behavior sequence encoder is used to learn a user's general interest and its evolving trend by taking into consideration the collective meta-knowledge extracted from multi-behavior sequences. We introduce two schemes (i.e., gathering and gathering-scattering) that model the dependencies across sequences in different manners. Furthermore, to realize the repeated occurrences of items in historical user-item interactions, we present the recurring-item-aware predictor based on the copy mechanism [14] where a mixed probabilistic function is established to predict the probability of each item in the next basket given the multi-behavior knowledge.\n\nThe major contributions of this article are summarized as follows:\n\n-We propose to exploit multi-behavior sequences for the NBR.
