[{"paperid": "paper0", "title": "ChestX-ray: Hospital-Scale Chest X-ray Database and Benchmarks on Weakly Supervised Classification and Localization of Common Thorax Diseases", "abstract": "The chest X-ray is one of the most commonly accessible radiological examinations for screening and diagnosis of many lung diseases. A tremendous number of X-ray imaging studies accompanied by radiological reports are accumulated and stored in many modern hospitals' Picture Archiving and Communication Systems (PACS). On the other side, it is still an open question how this type of hospital-size knowledge database containing invaluable imaging informatics (i.e., loosely labeled) can be used to facilitate the data-hungry deep learning paradigms in building truly large-scale high precision computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) systems. In this paper, we present a new chest X-ray database, namely\"ChestX-ray8\", which comprises 108,948 frontal-view X-ray images of 32,717 unique patients with the text-mined eight disease image labels (where each image can have multi-labels), from the associated radiological reports using natural language processing. Importantly, we demonstrate that these commonly occurring thoracic diseases can be detected and even spatially-located via a unified weakly-supervised multi-label image classification and disease localization framework, which is validated using our proposed dataset. Although the initial quantitative results are promising as reported, deep convolutional neural network based\"reading chest X-rays\"(i.e., recognizing and locating the common disease patterns trained with only image-level labels) remains a strenuous task for fully-automated high precision CAD systems.

Drastically improved quantitative performances in object recognition, detection and segmentation are demonstrated in Figure 1. Eight common thoracic diseases observed in chest X-rays that validate a challenging task of fully-automated diagnosis.\n\ncomparison to previous shallow methodologies built upon hand-crafted image features. Deep neural network representations further make the joint language and vision learning tasks more feasible to solve, in image captioning [49,24,33,48,23], visual question answering [2,46,51,55] and knowledge-guided transfer learning [4,34], and so on. However, the intriguing and strongly observable performance gaps of the current state-of-the-art object detection and segmentation methods, evaluated between using PASCAL VOC [13] and employing Microsoft (MS) COCO [28], demonstrate that there is still significant room for performance improvement when underlying challenges (represented by different datasets) become greater. For example, MS COCO is composed of 80 object categories from 200k images, with 1.2M instances (350k are people) where every instance is segmented and many instances are small objects. Comparing to PASCAL VOC of only 20 classes and 11,530 images containing 27,450 annotated objects with bounding-boxes (BBox), the top competing object detection approaches achieve in 0.413 in MS COCO versus 0.884 in PASCAL VOC under mean Average Precision (mAP).\n\nDeep learning yields similar rises in performance in the medical image analysis domain for object (often human anatomical or pathological structures in radiology imaging) detection and segmentation tasks. Recent notable work includes (but do not limit to) an overview review on the future promise of deep learning [14] and a collection of important medical applications on lymph node and interstitial lung disease detection and classification [37,43]; cerebral microbleed detection [11]; pulmonary nodule detection in CT images [40]; automated pancreas segmentation [36]; cell image segmentation and tracking [35], predicting spinal radiological scores [21] and extensions of multi-modal imaging segmentation [30,16]. The main limitation is that all proposed methods are evaluated on some small-to-middle scale problems of (at most) several hundred patients. It remains unclear how well the current deep learning techniques will scale up to tens of thousands of patient studies.\n\nIn the era of deep learning in computer vision, research efforts on building various annotated image datasets [38,13,28,2,33,55,23,25] with different characteristics play indispensably important roles on the better definition of the forthcoming problems, challenges and subsequently possible technological progresses. Particularly, here we focus on the relationship and joint learning of image (chest Xrays) and text (X-ray reports). The previous representative image caption generation work [49,24] utilize Flickr8K, Flickr30K [53] and MS COCO [28] datasets that hold 8,000, 31,000 and 123,000 images respectively and every image is annotated by five sentences via Amazon Mechanical Turk (AMT). The text generally describes annotator's attention of objects and activity occurring on an image in a straightforward manner. Region-level ImageNet pre-trained convolutional neural networks (CNN) based detectors are used to parse an input image and output a list of attributes or \"visually-grounded high-level concepts\" (including objects, actions, scenes and so on) in [24,51]. Visual question answering (VQA) requires more detailed parsing and complex reasoning on the image contents to answer the paired natural language questions. A new dataset containing 250k natural images, 760k questions and 10M text answers [2] is provided to address this new challenge. Additionally, databases such as \"Flickr30k Entities\" [33], \"Visual7W\" [55] and \"Visual Genome\" [25,23] (as detailed as 94,000 images and 4,100,000 region-grounded captions) are introduced to construct and learn the spatially-dense and increasingly difficult semantic links between textual descriptions and image regions through the object-level grounding.\n\nThough one could argue that the high-level analogy exists between image caption generation, visual question answering and imaging based disease diagnosis [42,41], there are three factors making truly large-scale medical image based diagnosis (e.g., involving tens of thousands of patients) tremendously more formidable. 1, Generic, openended image-level anatomy and pathology labels cannot be obtained through crowd-sourcing, such as AMT, which is prohibitively implausible for non-medically trained annota-tors. Therefore we exploit to mine the per-image (possibly multiple) common thoracic pathology labels from the image-attached chest X-ray radiological reports using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. Radiologists tend to write more abstract and complex logical reasoning sentences than the plain describing texts in [53,28]. 2, The spatial dimensions of an chest X-ray are usually 2000\u00d73000 pixels. Local pathological image regions can show hugely varying sizes or extents but often very small comparing to the full image scale. Fig. 1 shows eight illustrative examples and the actual pathological findings are often significantly smaller (thus harder to detect). Fully dense annotation of region-level bounding boxes (for grounding the pathological findings) would normally be needed in computer vision datasets [33,55,25] but may be completely nonviable for the time being. Consequently, we formulate and verify a weakly-supervised multi-label image classification and disease localization framework to address this difficulty. 3, So far, all image captioning and VQA techniques in computer vision strongly depend on the ImageNet pre-trained deep CNN models which already perform very well in a large number of object classes and serves a good baseline for further model fine-tuning. However, this situation does not apply to the medical image diagnosis domain. Thus we have to learn the deep image recognition and localization models while constructing the weakly-labeled medical image database.\n\nTo tackle these issues, we propose a new chest X-ray database, namely \"ChestX-ray8\", which comprises 108,948 frontal-view X-ray images of 32,717 (collected from the year of 1992 to 2015) unique patients with the text-mined eight common disease labels, mined from the text radiological reports via NLP techniques. In particular, we demonstrate that these commonly occurred thoracic diseases can be detected and even spatially-located via a unified weakly-supervised multi-label image classification and disease localization formulation. Our initial quantitative results are promising. However developing fully-automated deep learning based \"reading chest X-rays\" systems is still an arduous journey to be exploited. Details of accessing the ChestX-ray8 dataset can be found via the website 1 .\n\n\n"}, {"paperid": "paper1", "title": "fastMRI: An Open Dataset and Benchmarks for Accelerated MRI", "abstract": "Accelerating Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) by taking fewer measurements has the potential to reduce medical costs, minimize stress to patients and make MRI possible in applications where it is currently prohibitively slow or expensive. We introduce the fastMRI dataset, a large-scale collection of both raw MR measurements and clinical MR images, that can be used for training and evaluation of machine-learning approaches to MR image reconstruction. By introducing standardized evaluation criteria and a freely-accessible dataset, our goal is to help the community make rapid advances in the state of the art for MR image reconstruction. We also provide a self-contained introduction to MRI for machine learning researchers with no medical imaging background.", "introduction": "\n\nThe excellent soft tissue contrast and flexibility of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) makes it a very powerful diagnostic tool for a wide range of disorders, including neurological, musculoskeletal, and oncological diseases. However, the long acquisition time in MRI, which can easily exceed 30 minutes, leads to low patient throughput, problems with patient comfort and compliance, artifacts from patient motion, and high exam costs.\n\nAs a consequence, increasing imaging speed has been a major ongoing research goal since the advent of MRI in the 1970s. Increases in imaging speed have been achieved through both hardware developments (such as improved magnetic field gradients) and software advances (such as new pulse sequences). One noteworthy development in this context is parallel imaging, introduced in the 1990s, which allows multiple data points to be sampled simultaneously, rather than in a traditional sequential order [39,26,9].\n\nThe introduction of compressed sensing (CS) in 2006 [2,23] promised another breakthrough in the reduction of MR scan time. At their core, CS techniques speed up the MR acquisition by acquiring less measurement data than has previously been required to reconstruct diagnostic quality images. Since undersampling of this kind violates the Nyquist-Shannon sampling theorem, aliasing 2 Introduction to MR Image Acquisition and Reconstruction MR imaging is an indirect process, whereby cross-sectional images of the subject's anatomy are produced from frequency and phase measurements instead of direct, spatially-resolved measurements. A measuring instrument, known as a receiver coil, is placed in proximity to the area to be imaged ( Figure 1). During imaging, a sequence of spatially-and temporally-varying magnetic fields, called a \"pulse sequence,\" is applied by the MRI machine. This induces the body to emit resonant electromagnetic response fields which are measured by the receiver coil. The measurements typically correspond to points along a prescribed path through the multidimensional Fourier-space representation of an imaged body. This Fourier space is known as k-space in the medical imaging community. In the most basic usage of MR imaging, the full Fourier-space representation of a region is captured by a sequence of samples that tile the space up to a specified maximum frequency. The spatially-resolved image m can be estimated from the full k-space y by performing an inverse multidimensional Fourier transform:\nm = F \u22121 (y),(1)\nwherem is a noise-corrupted estimate of the true image m.\n\nThe number of samples captured in k-space is a limiting factor for the speed of MR imaging. Fewer samples can be captured by sampling up to a lower maximum frequency, however this produces images of lower spatial resolution. An alternative undersampling approach involves omitting some number of k-space samples within a given maximum frequency range, which then results in aliasing artifacts. In order to remove these artifacts and infer the true underlying spatial structure of the imaged subject, one may apply a number of possible reconstruction strategies.\n\n\n"}, {"paperid": "paper2", "title": "PTB-XL, a large publicly available electrocardiography dataset", "abstract": "Electrocardiography (ECG) is a key non-invasive diagnostic tool for cardiovascular diseases which is increasingly supported by algorithms based on machine learning.
