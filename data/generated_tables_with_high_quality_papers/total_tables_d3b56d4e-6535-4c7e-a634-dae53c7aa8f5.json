            "abstract": "Current machine learning classifiers have successfully been applied to whole-genome sequencing data to identify genetic determinants of antimicrobial resistance (AMR), but they lack causal interpretation. Here we present a metabolic model-based machine learning classifier, named Metabolic Allele Classifier (MAC), that uses flux balance analysis to estimate the biochemical effects of alleles. We apply the MAC to a dataset of 1595 drug-tested Mycobacterium tuberculosis strains and show that MACs predict AMR phenotypes with accuracy on par with mechanism-agnostic machine learning models (isoniazid AUC\u2009=\u20090.93) while enabling a biochemical interpretation of the genotype-phenotype map. Interpretation of MACs for three antibiotics (pyrazinamide, para-aminosalicylic acid, and isoniazid) recapitulates known AMR mechanisms and suggest a biochemical basis for how the identified alleles cause AMR. Extending flux balance analysis to identify accurate sequence classifiers thus contributes mechanistic insights to GWAS, a field thus far dominated by mechanism-agnostic results.",
            "introduction": "M ycobacterium tuberculosis (TB) claims 1.6 million lives annually and resists eradication through evolution of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) 1 . To elucidate AMR mechanisms, researchers have applied machine learning approaches to large-scale genome sequencing and drug-testing datasets for identifying genetic determinants of AMR [2][3][4][5][6][7] . While current machine learning approaches have provided a predictive tool for microbial genome-wide association studies (GWAS), such black-box models are incapable of mechanistically interpreting genetic associations. Such a limitation has become increasingly apparent in TB, where numerous experimental studies have shown that AMR-associated genetic variants often reflect network-level metabolic adaptations to antibiotic-induced selection pressures ( Supplementary Fig. 1 [8][9][10][11][12] . These studies show that identified genetic associations have corresponding network-level associations that are highly informative of AMR mechanisms. However, current GWAS results only provide predictions for which alleles are most important, not their functional effects. Therefore, machine learning models that incorporate biochemical network structure may naturally extend GWAS results by estimating functional effects of identified alleles, leading to an enhanced understanding of AMR [13][14][15] .\n\nOver the past couple of decades, the computational analysis of biochemical networks in microorganisms has been advanced through the use of genome-scale models (GEMs) 16,17 . By computing metabolic flux states (see Glossary for definition of terms) consistent with imposed biological constraints, GEMs have been shown to predict a range of cellular functions, making them a valuable tool for analyzing multi-omics datasets 18 . Although GEMs are transparent genotype-phenotype models, they are largely outperformed by machine learning models in direct comparisons of prediction accuracy. Approaches have thus been developed that integrate meaningful GEM computations with predictive black-box machine learning to enable white-box interpretations of data 19 . These approaches have worked well for endogenous metabolomics data by using the GEM to directly transform the measurements to meaningful inputs for black box machine learning.\n\nThis approach, however, may not be amenable to analyzing microbial GWAS data, in which the genetic parameters of the GEM are not directly observed (see Supplementary Notes). GEMs have previously modeled genetic variation at the resolution of gene presence-absence 20-23 , but have not yet been used to link nucleotide-level genetic variation (i.e., alleles) to observed phenotypes (i.e., AMR) in a predictive manner 24 . Since alleles are the primary forms of causal variation identified in GWAS, an approach for mechanistically integrating information about alleles is of major interest 25 .\n\nHere we develop a GEM-based machine learning framework for modeling datasets used in GWAS and apply it to a sequencing dataset of drug-tested TB strains. We show that our framework achieves high performance in accurately classifying AMR phenotypes of TB strains. We then characterize the identified classifiers for pyrazinamide, isoniazid, and para-aminosalicylic acid AMR and show that they identify key genetic determinants and pathway activity discriminating between resistant and susceptible TB strains. This work demonstrates how GEMs can be used directly as an input-output machine learning model to extract both genetic and biochemical network-level insights from microbial GWAS datasets."

            "abstract": "Informative and accurate survival prediction with individualized dynamic risk profiles over time is critical for personalized disease prevention and clinical management. The massive genetic data, such as SNPs from genome\u2010wide association studies (GWAS), together with well\u2010characterized time\u2010to\u2010event phenotypes provide unprecedented opportunities for developing effective survival prediction models. Recent advances in deep learning have made extraordinary achievements in establishing powerful prediction models in the biomedical field. However, the applications of deep learning approaches in survival prediction are limited, especially with utilizing the wealthy GWAS data. Motivated by developing powerful prediction models for the progression of an eye disease, age\u2010related macular degeneration (AMD), we develop and implement a multilayer deep neural network (DNN) survival model to effectively extract features and make accurate and interpretable predictions. Various simulation studies are performed to compare the prediction performance of the DNN survival model with several other machine learning\u2010based survival models. Finally, using the GWAS data from two large\u2010scale randomized clinical trials in AMD with over 7800 observations, we show that the DNN survival model not only outperforms several existing survival prediction models in terms of prediction accuracy (eg, c\u2010index =0.76), but also successfully detects clinically meaningful risk subgroups by effectively learning the complex structures among genetic variants. Moreover, we obtain a subject\u2010specific importance measure for each predictor from the DNN survival model, which provides valuable insights into the personalized early prevention and clinical management for this disease.",
            "introduction": "regarding the disease progression pattern in the future and shapes the physician's decision making for the treatment or clinical management strategy. Note that the survival prediction is fundamentally different from typical prediction models that predict a future event (whether occurs or not) by fixing the time of interest through a binary classification. 3,4 Despite its essential role in precision medicine, the survival prediction remains a challenging task, [5][6][7] largely due to the complex nature of diseases and the heterogeneity between patients. Therefore, there is an urgent need for developing accurate and personalized survival prediction models with improved capacity in learning the complex structures and interplays among predictors. Recent advances in high-throughput technologies have generated large volumes of molecular profiling data for each patient, which provides unprecedented opportunities in identifying potential biomarkers and further establishing accurate survival prediction models. [8][9][10] In particular, several national-wide large-scale longitudinal studies, such as the trans-omics for precision medicine and All of Us, are underway using whole-genome sequencing and other omics technologies, with the ultimate goal of accelerating precision medicine. However, how to effectively utilize the wealthy amount of data is challenging. The first challenge comes from how to connect high-dimensional predictors with the outcome of interest. This problem is particularly difficult in survival prediction because the events of interest are sometimes censored due to either a short study period or loss of follow-up during the study. The second challenge is how to model the complex structure among numerous biomarkers, where the specific structure is largely unknown. The third challenge is that given the heterogeneity of patients, how to interpret the importance of each predictor for each patient and further how to identify patient subgroups to provide personalized prevention or treatment strategy.\n\nThe recent advances in multilayer deep neural network (DNN) models have made extraordinary achievements in providing new effective risk prediction models from complex and high-dimensional biomedical data, such as omics and biomedical imaging. [11][12][13][14] However, the application of deep learning in survival prediction is still limited. Faraggi and Simon 15 proposed a single-layer neural network based on the Cox proportional hazards (PH) model. However, its performance did not exceed the regular Cox model in a prostate cancer survival dataset with 475 patents and only four clinical predictors. More recently, multiple efforts have been devoted to evaluating Cox-based neural network survival models using larger datasets with omic biomarkers. For example, Katzman et al 16 demonstrated that a single hidden layer neural network survival model performed marginally better than the Cox model and random survival forest (RSF) model in a breast cancer survival dataset with 1980 patients and nine predictors. In another study, Ching et al 17 applied a single hidden layer neural network survival model to 10 TCGA cancer survival datasets (sample sizes range from 302 to 1077) with high-throughput gene expression biomarkers, from which the neural network survival models resulted in comparable or better performance than the Cox model, the penalized Cox models such as Cox-LASSO and the RSF model. In another study 18 that also used TCGA cancer survival datasets (sample sizes range from 194 to 1092 with up to 17 000 gene expression biomarkers), the neural network survival models yielded comparable performance to the penalized Cox model and better performance than the RSF model. Hao et al 19 developed a pathway-based neural network survival model and applied it to a TCGA cancer dataset (sample size 522 with 860 pathways and 5567 genes). However, all these studies have limited sample sizes, particular in the presence of tens of thousands of predictors, and thus may lead to severe model overfitting problem. Moreover, the patient-specific predictor importance was not considered in those studies. The scenario of tied events, which is commonly seen in practice, especially when the sample size is large, was not carefully considered in these studies.\n\nIn this article, we propose and evaluate a multi-hidden-layer Cox-based DNN survival model to predict the progression of a progressive eye disease, namely, age-related macular degeneration (AMD). The genome-wide association study (GWAS) of AMD is the first and most successful GWAS research, where the massive GWAS data provide unprecedented opportunities to study disease risk and progression. Although some attempts have been tried to predict AMD progression risks using genetic information such as SNPs, most statistical models focus on the structured regression framework, which typically only accounts for (generalized) linear effects of the SNPs and thus have considerable limitations. To the best of our knowledge, there has no existing work on survival prediction using deep learning to effectively extract features from the GWAS data. Therefore, we develop and apply the DNN survival model to build an accurate and interpretable prediction model for the AMD progression.\n\nThe rest of the article is organized as follows. Section 2 describes the deep learning survival methods and prediction evaluation procedures. We assess the performance of three machine/deep learning survival prediction models (DNN, LASSO, RSF) through extensive simulation studies in Section 3 and apply them to the GWAS data from two large-scale clinical studies of AMD in Section 4. Discussion and conclusion are presented in Section 5."

            "abstract": "The SARS-CoV2 virus behind the COVID-19 pandemic is manifesting itself in different ways among infected people. While many are experiencing mild flue-like symptoms or are even remaining asymptomatic after infection, the virus has also led to serious complications, overloading ICUs while claiming more than 2.6 million lives world-wide. In this work, we apply AI methods to better understand factors that drive the severity of the disease. From the UK BioBank dataset we analyzed both clinical and genomic data of patients infected by this virus. Leveraging positiveunlabeled machine learning algorithms coupled with RubricOE, a state-of-the-art genomic analysis framework forgenomic feature extraction, we propose severity prediction algorithms with high F1 score. Furthermore, we extracted insights on clinical and genomic factors driving the severity prediction. We also report on how these factors have evolved during the pandemic w.r.t. significant events such as the emergence of the B.1.1.7 SARS-CoV2 virus strain.",
            "introduction": "\n\nCOVID-19, caused by the deadly \"severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2\" (SARS-CoV2) virus, is one of the worst pandemic in human history inflicting severe casualties across the globe. So far, it has caused 117,332,262 confirmed cases while claiming 2,605,356 deaths worldwide 1 . This virus has stressed many health systems beyond their limits, screaming for an urgent reaction from research to help mitigate this unprecedented societal threat.\n\nThe outbreak of the virus first occurred in Wuhan province of China and then rapidly spread world-wide using humanto-human transmission 2 . One of the primary reason for the rapid spread is due to the wide spectrum of symptoms inhibited by the virus ranging from asymptomatic to mild to rapid progression to critical stage with pneumonia and likely death of respiratory failure 3 . In general, patients with mild symptoms cure easily whereas severe COVID-19 patients require further treatments such as ventilation in ICU. Such heterogeneity in terms of COVID-19 disease pose great challenges for designing treatment protocols. Typically, severe effects of infectious diseases like COVID-19 are hypothesized to be associated with the variations of host genome 4 . Several studies 5 were conducted recently to find the biological mechanisms of the severity of COVID-19 diseases such as genome wide association studies (GWAS) of severe COVID-19 6 . In addition, clinical factors such as demographic, socio-economic factors, lifestyles, prior conditions may also have impact on the spread, exposure, and severity. So does the viral load of the SARS-CoV2 virus. The availability of rich electronic health records (EHR) provides an opportunity for finding such important clinical factors associated with COVID-19 along with important clinical factors observed in EHRs 3,7,8 .\n\nFinding the bio-markers for severe COVID-19 patients requires rigorous study on clinical and genomic datasets. Most of the existing studies that aimed at finding the common risk factors for severe COVID-19 patients focused on either the clinical or the genomics factors, but not both. In this study, we aim to find the common risk factors associated COVID-19 severity using diverse factors from both clinical and genomics data available from a large-scale EHR dataset. Such kind of combined clinico-genomic factors can provide a holistic view of COVID-19 disease mechanisms. Specifically, it can provide the additional effects of genomic factors on the host genome as they relate to common clinical factors.\n\nHowever, there are few challenges in finding the clinical and genomic factors associated with COVID-19 that can be used as bio-markers. First, defining the COVID-19 severity from EHR datasets is often challenging, since it is not collected directly in these datasets. Hence, the severity has to be defined using some clinical knowledge as a surrogate phenotype which in turn may introduce label noise and data collection bias. Second, assessing the impact of genomic factors on COVID-19 severity may be confounded by several other clinical factors such as the prior comorbidities of patients and treatment protocols. The effect of such confounding factors has to be addressed carefully when conducting the combined clinico-genomic studies. Third, the impact of clinico-genomic factors may also vary depending on the variations of diverse COVID-19 strains that have been observed due to genetic mutations.  Origin=0 11,989  9,083 21,072  Origin=1 31,800  4,345 36,145  All  43,789  13,428 57,217 In this study, we propose a combined framework for finding the clinical and genomic factors associated with COVID-19 severity using a large COVID-19 dataset from the UK Biobank (UKBB). To address the above mentioned challenges, we first use the COVID-19 related hospitalization as a surrogate outcome for defining severe COVID-19 cases. Second, we use a machine learning technique called positive-unlabeled (PU) learning to address the noise and reporting bias present in COVID-19 severity labels. Moreover, we use a recently proposed genomic analysis framework entitled RubricOE 9 to select the set of genomic factors after adjusting for the common prior comorbid conditions which may act as potential confounders. Finally, we aim to assess how the importance of the extracted bio-markers evolve over the pandemic marked by event such as the emergence of the reportedly more contagious B.1.1.7 COVID-19 strain.\n\n\n"

            "abstract": "Applying deep learning in population genomics is challenging because of computational issues and lack of interpretable models. Here, we propose GenNet, a novel open-source deep learning framework for predicting phenotypes from genetic variants. In this framework, interpretable and memory-efficient neural network architectures are constructed by embedding biologically knowledge from public databases, resulting in neural networks that contain only biologically plausible connections. We applied the framework to seventeen phenotypes and found well-replicated genes such as HERC2 and OCA2 for hair and eye color, and novel genes such as ZNF773 and PCNT for schizophrenia. Additionally, the framework identified ubiquitin mediated proteolysis, endocrine system and viral infectious diseases as most predictive biological pathways for schizophrenia. GenNet is a freely available, end-to-end deep learning framework that allows researchers to develop and use interpretable neural networks to obtain novel insights into the genetic architecture of complex traits and diseases.",
            "introduction": "W hile genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified numerous genomic loci associated with complex traits and diseases, the biological interpretation of the underlying mechanisms often remains unclear. Recent GWAS studies with increasingly large sample sizes are resulting greater numbers of significant associations, at an increasing number of independent loci. To illustrate, the latest GWAS for body height based on 700,000 individuals identified more than 3000 near-independent significantly associated single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) 1 . Uncovering a clear biological interpretation from all this information is a challenging task, in which causal variants, genes, and pathways need to be identified. In response, many methods such as MAGMA 2 , ALIGATOR 3 , and INRICH 4 , have been developed to obtain a biological interpretation from GWAS summary statistics, providing insights into relevant genes and pathways for defined phenotypes of interest. These methods explore GWAS summary statics and utilize knowledge from annotated biological databases such as NCBI RefSeq 5 , KEGG 6 , Reactome 7 , and GTEx 8 , which have proven to contain crucial information for understanding the underlying biological mechanisms of the human genome 9 . Additionally, it has been shown that embedding biological knowledge from these databases in polygenic risk scores can improve interpretation, trans-ancestry portability, and genetic risk prediction [10][11][12] .\n\nGiven the increasing amount of data available via biobanks and new developments to integrate data, it is now feasible to analyze raw data with more advanced methods. Deep learning is the state of the art in many domains such as medical image analysis 13 and natural language processing 14 because of its flexibility and modeling capabilities. In many cases, deep learning yields better performance than traditional approaches, since it scales very well with data size and can model highly non-linear relationships. However, a limitation to deep learning is that these algorithms are often uninterpretable because of their complexity 15,16 . Additionally, genetic data does not lend itself well to the convolution operation, the main driver of the success of deep learning in the imaging domain. Traditional fully connected neural networks have been successfully applied to predict genetic risk. Recently, Badre et al. 17 employed a fully connected neural network for improving polygenic risk scores for breast cancer, training a neural network with up to 528,620 input variants. However, these networks are very memory-intensive and therefore often require pre-selecting SNPs using GWAS summary statistics. Applying these fully connected neural networks for millions of input variants would require infeasible amounts of computational time and memory.\n\nTo overcome these limitations, we propose GenNet, a novel framework for predicting phenotype from genotype. Within the GenNet framework, biological information from annotated biological sources such as NCBI RefSeq, KEGG, and single RNA gene expression datasets, is used to define biologically plausible connections. As a result, neural networks based on this framework are memory efficient, interpretable, and yield biological interpretations for their predictions. GenNet is an end-to-end deep learning framework available as a command-line tool (https://github.com/ArnovanHilten/GenNet/)."

            "abstract": "Purpose Because age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is a progressive disorder and advanced AMD is currently hard to cure, an accurate and informative prediction of a person's AMD risk using genetic information is desirable for early diagnosis and potential individualized clinical management. The objective of this study was to develop and validate novel prediction models for AMD risk using large genome-wide association studies datasets with different machine learning approaches. Methods Genotype data from 32,215 Caucasian individuals with age of \u226550 years from the International AMD Genomics Consortium in dbGaP were used to establish and test prediction models for AMD risk. Four different machine learning approaches\u2014neural network, lasso regression, support vector machine, and random forest\u2014were implemented. A standard logistic regression model using a genetic risk score was also considered. Results All machine learning\u2013based methods achieved satisfactory performance for predicting advanced AMD cases (vs. normal controls) (area under the curve = 0.81\u20130.82, Brier score = 0.17\u20130.18 in a separate test dataset) and any stage AMD (vs. normal controls) (area under the curve = 0.78\u20130.79, Brier score = 0.18\u20130.20 in a separate test dataset). The prediction performance was further validated in an independent dataset of 783 subjects from UK Biobank (area under the curve = 0.67).

            "introduction": "\n\nAge-related macular degeneration (AMD) is a multifactorial neurodegenerative disease and a leading cause of vision loss among the elderly in the developed countries. 1,2 The disease affects the central vision and is progressive, starting with the appearance of drusen (i.e., the yellow or white deposits in the eye) and eventually leading to advanced AMD forms: wet AMD (choroidal neovascularization) and dry AMD (geographic atrophy). 3 Patients can progress to one or both forms of advanced AMD. Some patients with early AMD maintain good vision for a long time without progressing to advanced AMD, whereas others quickly developed advanced AMD.\n\nIn 2005, Fisher et al. 4 reported that the CFH gene on chromosome 1 and ARMS2/HTRA1 genes on chromosome 10 were the most replicated gene regions associated with AMD. Later, with the advances of technology, multiple genome-wide association studies (GWAS) were conducted to examine the association between AMD and a genome-wide set of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). In 2016, the International AMD Genomics Consortium identified or confirmed a total of 34 loci with 52 independent genetic variants to be associated with advanced AMD risk. 5 From this study, the phenotype and genotypes of 35,358 subjects were uploaded to dbGaP (phs001039.v1.p1) and the majority of them are Caucasians. Multiple studies demonstrated that the same AMD susceptibility loci were more strongly associated with AMD in Caucasians than in other ethnic groups. [6][7][8] Because advanced AMD is currently hard to cure, an accurate and informative prediction of a person's risk for advanced AMD at a young age using genetic information is desirable for early diagnosis, enhanced diet/behavior, and potential individualized clinical management. For example, for individuals with high predicted AMD risks, behaviors that could decrease AMD risk such as stopping smoking, keeping a healthy diet with more antioxidants, and taking appropriate vitamin supplements can be recommended. Earlier or more frequent clinical visits to monitor the development or progression of the disease can be also suggested to individuals with high AMD risks. In this study, our objective was to establish and validate prediction models for AMD risk based on genetic variants given any future age of a subject using the largest publicly available data for Caucasians.\n\n\n"

            "abstract": "Graphical abstract",
            "introduction": "\n\nThe advent of high-throughput omics technologies, such as the next-generation sequencing [1], DNA microarrays [2], and DNA methylation arrays [3] enable the measurement of thousands of molecules at the same time from a biological sample comprehensively. Each type of omics data provides unbiased characterization on one aspect of genome, transcriptome, and epigenome, which raises opportunities for biological and medical research explorations [4,5]. However, analysis of single omics data is limited to exploring the underlying biological mechanisms and capturing intricacy for various complex diseases, which only can explain its molecular field respectively [6]. Therefore, integrating multiomics data at different levels yields a better understanding of overall disease alterations, has an enormous impact in cancer profiling, diagnosis, and treatment, and elucidates the relationships among different types of omics data for one specific disease [7].\n\nDeveloping accurate survival prediction models of cancer benefits the identification of effective prognostic biomarkers, improvement of risk stratification, and personalized treatment. With the accumulation of a tremendous number of multiple omics data in the past decades, it brings opportunities to build the prediction model and infer the systematic underlying biological mechanisms through making an integrative analysis. However, it raises new computational challenges in the data integration due to the heterogeneous characteristics and distribution of different types of data, the high dimensionality of each level of a molecular dataset, and a limited number of observations [8][9][10]. To address these issues, a variety of regression methods have been proposed to build the prognostic model through integrating multi-omics data [11].\n\nThere are mainly four kinds of approaches to predict the survival time, namely penalized regression, boosting, random forest, and deep learning-based methods [12]. Integrative LASSO with Penalty Factors (IPF-LASSO) [13], an extension of LASSO method, is designed to make the L1-penalized regression analysis by using different penalty weights for each type of omics data to train the  [14]. Both glmboost and IPF-LASSO can be applied to multi-omics data with high dimension, which perform the feature selection and reduce the complexity of the model. However, they could only detect the linear relationships between features and outcome variables through fitting linear models. Block forest, a variant from random forest, incorporates the block structure of multi-omics data and makes the non-linear prediction of the clinical outcomes [15]. The limitation of block forest is that they can't extrapolate the data.\n\nSome deep learning-based methods were also applied to train the survival model. DeepSurv was a method of the deep feedforward neural network to perform a prediction of time-to-event to make personalized treatment recommendations. It estimated each sample's effect on their hazard rates concerning parametrized weights of the network, which was configurable with multiple numbers of hidden layers [16]. DeepHIT was a deep neural network architecture to learn the joint distribution of survival time and event directly without making assumptions about the underlying stochastic process [17]. The parameters of the model and the form of the stochastic process depended on the features of the input dataset used for survival analysis. However, these two methods were not designed for integrating multi-omics data and lacked interpretability. It was urgent to propose an interpretable nonlinear model for multi-omics data integration and survival prediction.\n\nTo fill the gaps of the algorithm in this field, we presented Dee-pOmix, a scalable and interpretable deep learning framework for multi-omics data integration and survival prediction. DeepOmix learned meaningful information by incorporating prior biological knowledge of gene functional module networks as the function module layer since genes perform functions in cells in the form of a synergistic and regulatory system [18]. Getting the lowdimensional representations in the functional module layer facilitates extracting significant modules corresponding to the prognostic prediction result. The functional modules can be defined by users, including tissue networks [19], gene co-expression networks [20], or prior biological signaling pathways [21]. We performed experiments of benchmark comparison and elucidated that the performance of DeepOmix outperformed other existing state of art prediction models. Then, Low-Grade Glioma (LGG) was taken as the case study. Patients were grouped into two subtypes with significant differences in survival time based on the output layer of the prediction result. The difference of functional nodes on the module layers in these subtypes was tested and top-ranked functional modules were detected. DeepOmix can integrate multiomics data by incorporating prior biological knowledge to conduct prognosis prediction and learn the low representations on the module layers to understand the underlying mechanisms for further study.\n\n\n"
