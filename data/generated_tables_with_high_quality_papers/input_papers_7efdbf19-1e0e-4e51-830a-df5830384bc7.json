Although existing methods for session-based behavior prediction leverage powerful representation learning approaches to encode items' sequential relevance in a low-dimensional space, they suffer from several limitations. Firstly, they focus on only utilizing the same type of user behavior for prediction, but ignore the potential of taking other behavior data as auxiliary information. This is particularly crucial when the target behavior is sparse but important (e.g., buying or sharing an item). Secondly, item-to-item relations are modeled separately and locally in one behavior sequence, and they lack a principled way to globally encode these relations more effectively.

Session-based target behavior prediction [8] is the one of the main studied problem in this regard, aiming to predict the next item to be interacted with a user under a specific type of behavior (e.g., clicking an item). Based on the predictions, information providers can effectively deliver items to appropriate users and at the same time, and users can quickly find the items what they actually want. Note that we use session-based prediction and session-based recommendation interchangeably throughout this paper.\n\nEarly studies for this problem assume that the appearance of the next item depends only on its previous item [23,33] in the same sequence. With such a strong assumption, they could only model the last item in each sequence and ignore other information from the sequence. To relieve this assumption, various methods adopt sequential models for session-based recommendation system to learn behavior sequences. Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) [9] is commonly leveraged to obtain promising performance. The relevant methods could roughly be attributed into two categories: singlesession based recommendation models [8,30] and multi-session based recommendation models [21,31]. As the latter category requires the user ID of each behavior sequence should be known in advance to link multiple sequences of the same user together, it is not so universal than the first category due to privacy issues and user scalability problem (e.g., a billion of active users each day in WeChat). As such, we study session-based target behavior prediction from the perspective of single-session based modeling.\n\nIn the domain of single-session based behavior prediction, some studies [14,22,25] adopt attention mechanism [1,28] and outperform the pioneering RNN based methods [8]. Recent advances in graph neural networks (GNN) [3,7] further boost the performance of session-based behavior prediction by modeling each sessionbased behavior sequence as a graph to achieve the state-of-the-art performance [29,30]. However, existing studies in this regard still suffer from several limitations. Firstly, they focus on only using the same type of user behavior as input for the next item prediction, but ignore the potential of leveraging other type of behavior as auxiliary information. This is particularly crucial when the target behavior is sparse but important (e.g., buying or sharing an item). Secondly, item-to-item relations are modeled separately and locally, since both RNN based and GNN based recommendation models only utilize one behavior sequence each time. It is intuitive that abundant item-to-item relations are hidden in various behavior sequences. For example, if many other users who have bought item B after buying item A, the relation between item A and B is especially vital if a target user just bought item A.\n\nTo overcome these limitations, we propose a novel Multi-relational Graph Neural Network model for Session-based target behavior Prediction, namely MGNN-SPred for short. The target behavior we focused on is the aforementioned sparse behavior beyond the dense click behavior. MGNN-SPred jointly considers target behavior and auxiliary behavior sequences and explores global item-toitem relations for accurate prediction. Specifically, for the purpose of considering the global item-to-item relations, we build a Multi-Relational Item Graph (MRIG) based on the past behavior sequences of all sessions. There might exist multiple relations between two graph nodes, denoting target and auxiliary behavior types. Based on MRIG, MGNN-SPred encodes global item-to-item relations into node representations and further obtains local representations for current target and auxiliary behavior sequences, respectively. In the end, MGNN-SPred leverages a gating mechanism to adaptively fuse the representations from target behavior sequence and auxiliary behavior sequence to produce current user interest representation.\n\nThe main contributions of this work is summarized as follows: 1. We address the two limitations of existing methods by breaking the restriction of only using one type of behavior sequence in session-based recommendation and exploring another type of behavior as auxiliary information. We further construct the multirelational item graph for learning global item-to-item relations.\n\n2. To effectively model MRIG w.r.t. target and auxiliary behavior sequences, we develop the novel graph model MGNN-SPred which learns global item-to-item relations through graph neural network and integrates representations of target and auxiliary of current sequences by the gating mechanism.\n\n3. We carry out extensive experiments and demonstrate MGNN-SPred achieves the best performance among strong competitors, showing the benefits of overcoming the two limitations.\n\n\n"}, {"paperid": "paper1", "title": "DMBGN: Deep Multi-Behavior Graph Networks for Voucher Redemption Rate Prediction", "abstract": "In E-commerce, vouchers are important marketing tools to enhance users' engagement and boost sales and revenue. The likelihood that a user redeems a voucher is a key factor in voucher distribution decision. User-item Click-Through-Rate (CTR) models are often applied to predict the user-voucher redemption rate. However, the voucher scenario involves more complicated relations among users, items and vouchers. The users' historical behavior in a voucher collection activity reflects users' voucher usage patterns, which is nevertheless overlooked by the CTR-based solutions. In this paper, we propose a Deep Multi-behavior Graph Networks (DMBGN) to shed light on this field for the voucher redemption rate prediction. The complex structural user-voucher-item relationships are captured by a User-Behavior Voucher Graph (UVG). User behavior happening both before and after voucher collection is taken into consideration, and a high-level representation is extracted by Higher-order Graph Neural Networks. On top of a sequence of UVGs, an attention network is built which can help to learn users' long-term voucher redemption preference. Extensive experiments on three large-scale production datasets demonstrate the proposed DMBGN model is effective, with 10% to 16% relative AUC improvement over Deep Neural Networks (DNN), and 2% to 4% AUC improvement over Deep Interest Network (DIN). Source code and a sample dataset are made publicly available to facilitate future research.", "introduction": "\n\nIn E-commerce, vouchers have already become significant tools which not only drive sales, but also help user growth and enhances customer loyalty. An online voucher (or coupon in some literature) is a digital ticket that can be redeemed with discount or rebate when a product is purchased 2 . A typical voucher is characterized by two components: condition and discount. The former specifies requirements of a voucher to be applicable, e.g, the minimum number of items purchased or the minimum amount of money spent in an order, and the latter refers to the amount or percentage deductible when the voucher is applied. This work focuses on minimum-spend and discount-amount based vouchers. Fig. 1 shows a typical user-voucher interaction scenario on an E-commerce platform: a user may do some online shopping before being assigned a voucher (i.e., pre-collection phase). After collecting the voucher (either manually or automatically), the user may continue to search, click or add-to-cart the items that he/she wants to buy with the voucher (i.e., post-collection phase). Finally, the user may redeem the voucher by purchasing some items (i.e., redemption phase), or simply leave the voucher expired without redemption. The capability of predicting the user-voucher redemption rate (VRR henceforth in this paper), the likelihood that a user may redeem a voucher, would contribute to a successful voucher marketing in multiple ways:\n\n\u2022 Performance Forecasting: Retailers are able to estimate the returns of a voucher (e.g. overall redemption rate, redeemed voucher count) before a campaign starts. \u2022 Budget Control: Retailers are able to know when to stop distributing vouchers so that the marketing budget would not be over-utilized or under-utilized. \u2022 Personalized Distribution: Retailers are able to distribute different voucher schema (e.g. condition and discount) to different customers to maximize the overall returns, by applying an optimization algorithm to the VRR results.\n\nThere are some preliminary studies [15,20,28] focusing on VRR prediction. Those studies solve voucher redemption rate prediction tasks by directly borrowing the ideas from user-item Click-Through-Rate (CTR) prediction models [6,38]. A common practice is to treat a given voucher in the same way as treating an item, simply replacing item features by voucher features in model training and prediction. Nonetheless, the VRR task is more challenging in several ways. Firstly, in item-wise CTR models, items in historical behavior and the item to be evaluated are homogeneous, while in VRR, the behavior involves heterogeneous relations between vouchers and items. Secondly, in CTR models, users' behavior on items has no obvious inter-dependent relationships. In voucher scenarios, by contrast, the user behavior is often triggered by the collected voucher and is strongly affected by the voucher condition and discount. As shown in Table 1, the behavior sequence in the post-collection phase becomes relatively longer than in pre-collection. Lastly, a user may have a multiple voucher redemption history, the long-term and short-term voucher usage preferences of the user need to be considered and balanced to better predict the VRR of the current voucher to be distributed (namely target voucher).\n\nTo tackle the above issues and shed light on the VRR prediction task, we propose a graph-based model Deep Multi-Behavior Graph Networks (DMBGN). To evaluate a user's VRR of the target voucher, DMBGN takes into consideration the user's historical interactions with vouchers. To model the structural user-voucher-item relationships, a User-Behavior Voucher Graph (UVG) is constructed for each user-voucher interaction activity. A UVG is a satellite-like heterogeneous graph containing nodes for both voucher and items in user behavior happening before and after the voucher collection. The techniques of Higher-order Graph Neural Networks are adopted to extract the high-level structural representation of a voucher activity, so that relationships like user-item preference, voucher-item dependency and user-voucher preference can be better distilled. To learn the user's long-term interests in voucher redemption, an attention network is applied on top of the historical UVG sequence. Finally, all the implicit representations of user, item, voucher and other side information are forwarded to a DNN network for the VRR prediction.\n\nThe main contributions of this paper are as follows:\n\n\u2022 To our best knowledge, this is the first work to propose a model specialized for the VRR prediction task. The model, DMBGN, follows the user's mindset in a real voucher activity \n\n\n"}, {"paperid": "paper2", "title": "Global and Personalized Graphs for Heterogeneous Sequential Recommendation by Learning Behavior Transitions and User Intentions", "abstract": "Heterogeneous sequential recommendation (HSR) is a very important recommendation problem, which aims to predict a user\u2019s next interacted item under a target behavior type (e.g., purchase in e-commerce sites) based on his/her historical interactions with different behaviors. Though existing sequential methods have achieved advanced performance by considering the varied impacts of interactions with sequential information, a large body of them still have two major shortcomings. Firstly, they usually model different behaviors separately without considering the correlations between them. The transitions from item to item under diverse behaviors indicate some users\u2019 potential behavior manner. Secondly, though the behavior information contains a user\u2019s fine-grained interests, the insufficient consideration of the local context information limits them from well understanding user intentions. Utilizing the adjacent interactions to better understand a user\u2019s behavior could improve the certainty of prediction. To address these two issues, we propose a novel solution utilizing global and personalized graphs for HSR (GPG4HSR) to learn behavior transitions and user intentions. Specifically, our GPG4HSR consists of two graphs, i.e., a global graph to capture the transitions between different behaviors, and a personalized graph to model items with behaviors by further considering the distinct user intentions of the adjacent contextually relevant nodes. Extensive experiments on four public datasets with the state-of-the-art baselines demonstrate the effectiveness and general applicability of our method GPG4HSR.", "introduction": "\n\nIn lots of scenes including e-commerce sites, recommender systems have played a crucial booster role. Through learning from the historical (user, item) interactions, it is able to generate the digital scores or a ranked list for the uninteracted items, and recommend some appropriate items for each user to alleviate the information overload problem. As a user's preferences widely exist in the form of sequence and the way he/she interacted with items, how to model the user's sequential and heterogeneous behaviors becomes a research hotspot recently.\n\nAlthough existing methods model the sequential and behavior information in an effective way, they usually suffer from the following two issues. Firstly, they often ignore the correlations of different behaviors. Specifically, the different transitions according to their behavior types indicate importance to a different extent, but modeling behaviors separately, i.e., splitting an interaction sequence into multiple subsequences according to the behavior types, cannot learn the potential correlations well as the connection between different types of behaviors is broken. Secondly, they usually model behaviors without utilizing the local context information. Even though the behavior information could capture different levels of user intentions, the context information is able to further enhance the certainty and decrease the randomness. For example, if a user Alice performed a sequence of browsing item A, adding item A to the cart, and purchasing item A, and another user Bob also performed an interaction sequence but with a slight difference, i.e., browsing item A, adding item A to the cart, and browsing item B. The behavior of adding item A to the cart exists in both sequences, which indicates a high probability of purchasing item A. However, the subsequent interactions are quite different, and are also very useful to obtain an enhanced understanding of \"adding item A to the cart\" for each user, i.e., Alice would purchase items in cart with higher certainty, but there is more randomness for Bob to do so.\n\nMost of traditional recommendation algorithms [9,18] fill a rating matrix of (user, item) pairs to deal with general recommendation, without utilizing the sequential and behavior information. Compared with general recommendation, early works for sequential recommendation [8,10,21,29] obtain better performance since they capture more accurate preferences by learning the sequential patterns. For instance, GRU4Rec [8] utilizes gated recurrent units (GRUs), a variant of recurrent neural networks (RNNs), to transmit the previous information to subsequent units for learning the sequential patterns inherently. With the increasing amount of e-commerce users and items, the information overload problem becomes crucial, while the increasing behavior data offers more detailed information to gain a deeper understanding of a user's intentions. This actually raises an emerging and valuable topic, i.e., heterogeneous sequential recommendation (HSR). For example, TransRec++ [31] adapts TransRec [5] to strengthen its ability of capturing the behavior transitions of users, which considers the correlations between different behaviors but lacks consideration of distinguishing those behaviors. RIB [32] concatenates the item and behavior embeddings as the input embedding to consider the influences of different behaviors, and adopts an RNN layer to learn the sequential patterns. However, concatenation of two embeddings could only learn the distinct importance of behaviors but not the relations between them. MGNN-SPred [23] constructs two itemto-item graphs by incorporating the context information between items under the same behavior in order to learn the transitions, but ignores the transitions under different behaviors.\n\nTo overcome these issues, we propose a novel solution called global and personalized graphs for heterogeneous sequential recommendation (GPG4HSR). Firstly, we introduce a global graph layer, equipped with a global graph (GG) of items and behavior transitions to capture the transitions between all behaviors, which addresses the aforementioned first issue. Secondly, to learn user intentions by distinguishing the varied effects of the same interaction with different context information and address the second issue, we utilize a personalized graph layer with a personalized graph (PG) of interaction sequence to model heterogeneous feedback with the influence of adjacent interactions. In addition, to balance these two modules (i.e., the global and personalized graph layers) and take a further step in learning the sequential patterns, we apply an effective fusion layer and an attention layer. Finally, we introduce a prediction layer in order to predict the next likely-to-purchase item. Note that we group all behaviors into examinations and purchases as their two representative behavior types, and the exploratory study in Section 6.2 indicates that our GPG4HSR is applicable to scenes with more types of behaviors.\n\nWe summarize our main contributions as follows: (i) We propose a novel model called GPG4HSR to address two fundamental issues in HSR by considering the correlations of all behaviors via a global graph (GG) and enhancing the interaction representation with the context information via a personalized graph (PG). (ii) We develop a global graph layer and a personalized graph layer to model GG and PG, respectively, in which the former weighs the transitions between different behaviors and the latter incorporates the representations of a local behavior and its adjacent contextually relevant interactions. (iii) We study the recommendation performance of our GPG4HSR and eight competitive baselines on four datasets, and find that our GPG4HSR performs the best in most cases. Moreover, further studies, including exploratory studies with more than two different types of behaviors, ablation studies of the major components, framework studies with different backbone models and sensitivity analysis of the hyperparameter, show the effectiveness of our solution.\n\n\n"}, {"paperid": "paper3", "title": "BGNN: Behavior-aware graph neural network for heterogeneous session-based recommendation", "abstract": "Session-based recommendation (SBR) and multi-behavior recommendation (MBR) are both important problems and have attracted the attention of many researchers and practitioners. Different from SBR that solely uses one single type of behavior sequences and MBR that neglects sequential dynamics, heterogeneous SBR (HSBR) that exploits different types of behavioral information (e.g., examinations like clicks or browses, purchases, adds-to-carts and adds-to-favorites) in sequences is more consistent with real-world recommendation scenarios, but it is rarely studied. Early efforts towards HSBR focus on distinguishing different types of behaviors or exploiting homogeneous behavior transitions in a sequence with the same type of behaviors. However, all the existing solutions for HSBR do not exploit the rich heterogeneous behavior transitions in an explicit way and thus may fail to capture the semantic relations between different types of behaviors. However, all the existing solutions for HSBR do not model the rich heterogeneous behavior transitions in the form of graphs and thus may fail to capture the semantic relations between different types of behaviors. The limitation hinders the development of HSBR and results in unsatisfactory performance. As a response, we propose a novel behavior-aware graph neural network (BGNN) for HSBR. Our BGNN adopts a dual-channel learning strategy for differentiated modeling of two different types of behavior sequences in a session.

Session-based recommendation aims to recommend the next possible interacted item to a user based on the user's behavior sequence in the session, which has recently been a research hotspot [3,4].\n\nHowever, session-based recommendation solely uses a single type of behavior sequence of the user and often faces the problem of data sparsity, especially when the behavior is naturally sparse [5]. For example, in an e-commerce scenario, the company's ultimate goal is to guide users to purchase items for profit while the data of purchases is very rare. Using only purchase sequences for session-based recommendation would lead to unsatisfactory recommendation performance since users' interests are diverse while the data is sparse [5,6]. For instance, a user may purchase certain items for certain occasions (such as birthday and festivals), or purchase items for his/her family members, which are both not related to their recent purchases [7].\n\nFortunately, the behavior sequence of a session in a realworld e-commerce platform is often heterogeneous and composed of more than one type of behaviors, e.g., purchases and examinations, in which examinations can be clicks or browses. Therefore, we can exploit the more abundant information in the heterogeneous behavior sequence to improve the recommendation performance of predicting the target behaviors, i.e., purchases. We name this type of research problem as heterogeneous session-based recommendation (HSBR) and name the traditional session-based recommendation as homogeneous session-based recommendation in this paper. Although the researches on HSBR are relatively few, we argue that HSBR is more consistent with the setting of real-world scenarios and deserves more attention from the community.\n\nExisting works for HSBR can be classified into two categories, i.e., methods based on recurrent neural network (RNN) [8][9][10] and methods based on graph neural network (GNN) [5,6]. In addition, some researchers have used Transformer-based methods in modeling of multi-behavior sequences in CTR and CVR tasks [11,12]. For example, the RNN-based method RIB [10] uses the behavior embedding to distinguish the different types of behaviors in a heterogeneous session, and takes the concatenation of the item embedding and the behavior embedding as the input of a gate recurrent unit (GRU) layer. The GNN-based method M-SR [5] proposes to treat a heterogeneous behavior sequence as an item sequence and an operation (behavior type) sequence for separate modeling. Specifically, M-SR uses a GNN method to model the complex item transitions in the item sequence and uses a GRU layer to model the operation sequence, supposing that there are sequential dependencies between different behavior types. The other GNN-based method MGNN-SPred [6] constructs a global multi-relational item graph based on two types of homogeneous behavior sequences, i.e., examination sequences and purchase sequences, over all sessions, and uses a GNN method to enhance the learning of item representations. Although MGNN-SPred strengthens the learning of item representations by exploiting the homogeneous behavior transition information, its modeling of different types of behavior sequences is the same, resulting in examining and purchasing an item will get the same representation in the feature space (see the details in Section 5.2.4), which may limit the capability of the model.\n\nMore importantly, most of the existing methods for HSBR focus on either distinguishing different types of behaviors or exploiting homogeneous behavior transitions intra each type of behavior sequences, while ignoring the useful information of heterogeneous behavior transitions inter different types of behavior sequences. For example, a user usually examines items for comparison before making a purchase decision, where the transition between examinations like clicks or browses indicates similarity and the transition from examination to purchase may indicate a progressive relationship [3]. Therefore, exploiting the heterogeneous behavior transitions is essential for learning the semantic connections between different types of behaviors and achieving accurate recommendation.\n\nTo fill this gap in HSBR, we propose to construct two different global graphs, i.e., homogeneous behavior transition graph (HoBTG) and heterogeneous behavior transition graph (HeBTG), based on all sessions to exploit the behavior transition information from two aspects, i.e., homogeneous and heterogeneous behavior transitions, respectively. We further propose a novel method named behavior-aware graph neural network (BGNN) to fully leverage the knowledge in the two graphs, in which a dual-channel learning strategy is designed to focus more on the modeling of the auxiliary behavior sequences, i.e., the examination sequences in this paper. To be more specific, we regard HoBTG as a common graph for learning high-quality item representations for both the purchases and the examinations, and utilize HeBTG for modeling of the examinations, aiming to explicitly utilize the purchase-oriented semantic connections implicit in HeBTG. In our BGNN, we introduce a personalized item neighbor aggregator (PING), which personalizes the messages passing in HeBTG by considering the users' purchase preference when aggregating neighboring nodes. And we also design a representation gating (RNG) module to balance the two views of item representations of the examination sequence learned from the two graphs. Moreover, BGNN learns the two types of behavior sequence representations through a parallel softattention mechanism, and finally fuses them into the session representation.\n\nThe main contributions of our work are summarized as follows.\n\n\u2022 We propose to construct two kinds of graphs, i.e., HoBTG and HeBTG, to capture the information of homogeneous behavior transitions and heterogeneous behavior transitions, respectively. \u2022 We propose a novel solution named behavior-aware graph neural network (BGNN) based on a dual-channel learning strategy, in which the use of HeBTG in the auxiliary channel makes the contribution of the auxiliary sequences to the target sequences more clear. \u2022 We design a personalized item neighbor aggregator (PING) to personalize the messages passing in HeBTG when aggregating neighboring nodes.

The visualization studies further verify the rationality and significance of exploiting heterogeneous behavior transitions in our BGNN.

Recommendation system can quickly provide us with the information that we are interested in by mining the historical interaction data and modeling users' profiles or preferences. However, it is usually difficult to obtain users' profiles because of privacy protection. In addition, users' preferences are instantaneous and variable, making it difficult to mine long-term user interests. To solve the above problems, researchers propose session-based recommendation (SR for short). SR refers to predicting the next interactive item that users may be interested in by mining the hidden preference in an anonymous session, where the session consists of multiple items that a user has clicked or bought in the past time slot [1]. Thus, SR is able to capture users' short-term and variable preferences, providing more timely and accurate recommendations for users. SR has become a popular research direction in recent years.\n\nThe majority of popular SR methods are mainly designed based on deep neural networks. For example, GRU4Rec [2] and NARM [3] are based on Recurrent Neural Network (RNN). They capture the dynamic users' preferences. The methods based on Graph Neural Network(GNN) model sessions as graphs and capture complex item transitions [4\u22127]. Although the above methods perform well and promote this area quickly, they only exploit single interactive behavior during the recommendation.\n\nIn fact, the session contains different types of behaviors. For example, a user may first click on an item and then perform a series of actions such as favorites, purchases. These actions are beneficial to mine users' dynamic preferences, and then improve the accuracy of recommendation.\n\nTherefore, recent studies are carried out to take multiple interactive behaviors into consideration. Wang et al. [8] proposed MGNN-SPred which constructs a multi-relational behavior graph based on two kinds of action sequences. With the help of all interactive behaviors, the users' preference representations are well learned, significantly improving the accuracy of the recommendation. However, the following limitations remain to be overcome.\n\n(1) Various types of interactive actions have different effects on recommendation. As is shown in Fig. 1(a), a user clicks foundation, lipstick, perfume, and eye shadow, and finally buy a bottle of foundation. It implies that the user is interested in make-up. The previous efforts on multiple actions focus on treating a certain action as a target, and the other actions are considered as auxiliaries. To model users' real preferences and improve the performance of recommendation, both the actions of click and buy should be considered simultaneously.\n\n(2) Noise is widely existed in historical interactive data. It is common that we may click a certain item or advertisement accidentally, when we browse what we are interested in. As is shown in Fig. 1(b), a user clicks foundation, lipstick, mouse, perfume, shoes and buys a lipstick. Obviously, the mouse and shoes are noise data that should be removed.\n\nTo solve these problems, we propose a behavior-aware graph neural network for session-based recommendation, BA-GNN. Specifically, we first construct directed graphs for click and purchase sequences to obtain the item representations. Then, a sparse self-attention module is designed to remove the noise in click sequences. The session representations are composed of the behavior sequences representations. Finally, we predict the users' next interactive items by session representations and item representations.\n\nOur main contributions are summarized as follows:\n\n\u2022 We propose a behavior-aware graph neural network for session-based recommendation. We fully consider the influences of different interactive behaviors, and construct directed graphs for the sequences with two kinds of interactive actions, respectively. \u2022 To remove the noise in interactive behavior sequences, we design a sparse self-attention module that obtains better sequence representations. \u2022 We conduct extensive experiments on two public datasets and compare with multiple baselines.
