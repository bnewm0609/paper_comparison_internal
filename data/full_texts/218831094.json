This suggests that Twitter is being utilized by the oncology community as a platform to discuss and disseminate high impact scientific articles. The correlation between Twitter and increasing the number of citations of an article through larger dissemination and exposure requires further studies.\n\nI n recent years, social media has exploded in popularity and use among health care stakeholders, including professionals and societies. Platforms like Twitter can allow for disseminating information to scientists and nonscientists alike, in an easily accessible manner. Twitter is used as a platform to discuss ideas, allowing short publicly accessible exchanges between individuals and is frequently used by scientific organizations for connecting with researchers, clinicians, patients, and patient advocates. Although the \"gold standard\" to measure the importance of an article remains the number of citations it receives and the impact factor of the journal the article is published in, the tweet count surrounding the article may represent a new metric for dissemination \"success.\" 1 Previous studies in the field of urology and radiology have looked at the relationship between Twitter presence and academic impact as measured by the number of academic citations 0. 2 To our knowledge, no data on the impact of social media in radiation oncology has been published. In this present study, we investigated the relationship between Twitter mentions and citation frequency of articles related to radiation oncology publications from several different journals.\n\n\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\n\nWe reviewed all articles published in the January and February 2018 edition of 3 radiation oncology journals, including the 2 most read clinical radiation oncology journals the International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics (Red J) and Radiotherapy and Oncology (Green J) as well as the journal Brachytherapy which is the most important journal dedicated to a subspecialty of radiation oncology of the same name. All articles were from the print publication, with the exception of articles from journals that were published bimonthly (ie, included January in its February issue) or whose publication in February was a double issue (ie, included March 2018 in its February issue). We also analyzed articles from the January and February 2018 publications of the 10 oncology journals with the highest impact factor in 2018 and selected those articles that included the words \"radiation,\" \"radiation oncology,\" or \"radiotherapy\" in the title or abstract. The oncology journals with the highest impact factors included: Cancer Journal for Clinicians, Lancet Oncology, Journal of Clinical Oncology, Cancer Discovery, Cancer Cell, JAMA Oncology, Annals of Oncology, Journal of Thoracic Oncology, Molecular Cancer, and Journal of the National Cancer Institute. We excluded brief manuscripts such as gray zone, comments, erratum, and editorials from the collected data.\n\n\nData Collection\n\nWe determined, for each publication, the record of citations via the Scopus and Google Scholar platform and the number of times an article has been tweeted using the \"Altmetric Bookmarklet\" (www. altmetric.com/products/free-tools/bookmarklet/). This information was collected on the same day to ensure that no data collection bias was introduced. Altmetric categorizes users from Twitter based on their posting history and profile information and compiles a table of Twitter demographics. For this purpose, Altmetric assigns each profile a category based on the detection of keywords in profile descriptions, types of journals followed by the user, and follower lists. From these data, Altmetric defines somebody as \"familiar with radiation oncology literature\" as one who tweets radiation oncologyrelated material. For more information on how Twitter demographics determined, see https://help.altmetric.com/support/solutions/articles/ 6000060978-how-are-twitter-demographics-determined.\n\nUsing Altmetric definitions, Twitter users were divided into 4 categories: (a) researcher which is defined by Altmetric as \"somebody who is familiar with literature\"; (b) practitioner working in clinical science as a clinician or researcher; (c) science communicator defined as \"somebody who links frequently to scientific articles from a variety of different journals/publishers\"; (d) \"member of the public\" corresponding to \"somebody who does not link to scholarly literature and does not otherwise fit any of the categories.\" For each article, we gathered the Altmetric information regarding the geographic location where the article was tweeted, the category of the person who tweeted the article and the number of followers by a person who has tweeted the article. Per Altmetric, the possible maximal exposure of an article on Twitter was defined as the \"upper bound of followers.\" This data is calculated using follower information for each person who tweets about an article. It can be found on the Twitter tab of the article's Altmetric Details Page. We calculated this number by multiplying the number of tweets per participant by the number of followers that each participant has. This metric corresponds to the theoretical maximum number of followers that could have seen that tweet. 3 We also gathered data regarding the corresponding author's sex using their Twitter profile and their department Web site. We collected the number of tweets preceding the paper's publication date (when the electronic publication date was available) as well as the number of tweets during the first week of its publication. We defined prepublication \"Buzz\" as an article that was tweeted \u2265 10 times before electronic publication.\n\n\nStatistical Analyses\n\nComparison between groups was done using either nonparametric tests (Kruskal-Wallis) or the Student t test to compare means. \u03c7 2 test was used to compare distributions between groups. Correlations between tweets and quotations in Google Scholar and Scopus were calculated using the Pearson correlation coefficient. Statistical significance was defined as P-values \u2264 0.05. Statistical analysis was done using SPSS 25.0 for Windows (IBM SPSS, Chicago, IL).\n\n\nRESULTS\n\nA total of 178 articles were analyzed. Table 1 lists the number of articles per journal with their respective number of citations and tweets. Most corresponding authors were from North America (49%), Europe (39%), and Asia (8%), while 5% of authors were from Australia and New Zealand. None of the articles were from South America or Africa. We observed that all articles from the Green J and 93% of articles from the Red J were tweeted at least once. As cited in Altmetric, 15 articles were shared on Facebook, 12 by news outlets, 45 on Google+, and 1 by a blog. Articles were shared on Twitter by 94 \"members of the public,\" 113 by scientists, 48 by doctors or other health care professionals, and 26 by science communicators (defined by Altmetric as journalists, editors).\n\nWe found a significant correlation between the number of tweets and the number of citations in Google Scholar (r = 0.55, P < 0.001) and in Scopus (r = 0.59, P < 0.001). The numbers of citations in Google Scholar and in Scopus were highly correlated with each other (r = 0.95, P < 0.001). However, for the Red J and the Green J, there was only a correlation between the number of tweets and the number of citations in either Google Scholar or Scopus, but not with both ( Table 2). The correlation was stronger for Brachytherapy than for the Green J and the Red J. The strongest correlation was found for the top 10 oncology journals.\n\nThirty-four (19%) papers in total were tweeted \u2265 10 times. This corresponded to 22% and 25% of the articles that were published in the Red J and the Green J, respectively as compared with only 3% of articles published in Brachytherapy and 62% of  Table 1). The first author of the 34 articles with \u2265 10 tweets were primarily from North America (44%) and Europe (44%) ( Table 3).\n\nWe defined a paper that created a prepublication \"buzz\" as an article that had \u2265 10 tweets before its paper publication. According to this definition, 19 articles, corresponding to 11% of all published articles, created a \"buzz.\" All were clinical papers and 3 were consensus papers, including 1 paper in Brachytherapy.\n\nThe most-tweeted article overall in this cohort was tweeted 132 times, including 6 times by members of the public (per Altmetric, someone who is not a clinician or a researcher); this was an article in the Green J by Hanna et al 4 from the University of New South Wales, Australia, analyzing the population benefit of radiotherapy on local control and overall survival at 5 years. This article was tweeted by 13 physicians Two other articles were also tweeted by 13 physicians: 1 from the Red J by Pathmanathan et al 5 from Royal Marsden in London, UK regarding magnetic resonance imaging-guided adaptive radiation therapy for prostate cancer and an article in the JAMA Oncology by Iyengar et al 6 from the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center in Dallas, Texas regarding a phase 2 trial on consolidative radiotherapy for limited metastatic non-small cell lung cancer. Articles with a prepublication buzz had 3.6 times more citations in Scopus (mean: 14.8 vs. 4.2, P < 0.001) and 2.9 times more citations in Google Scholar (17.8 vs. 6.0, P < 0.001) than papers without a buzz.\n\nWe were unable to identify the sex of the first author for 8 (5%) articles. Six of these first authors were from Asia. Four were published in Brachytherapy and 3 in the Red J. Of the articles with a recorded first author's sex, 68% were male and 32% female. There was no difference (P = 0.31) in the number of articles that were not tweeted (n = 51, 29%) between sexes.\n\nAmong articles that were not tweeted, 72% were from males and 28% from females. Articles that were tweeted \u2265 10 times had in 65% a male and in 35% a female as a first author (P = 0.33). The mean number of tweets per article was not associated with the sex of the first author; male-authored papers had 8.2 tweets (SD = 16.9) versus female-authors' papers with 8.8 tweets (SD = 18.7), P = 0.8. There was no difference in sex between first authors who created a buzz (P = 0.5). The corresponding author of these articles was a male in 74% and a female in 26%.\n\n\nDISCUSSION\n\nThe main objective of this article was to evaluate the correlation between the number of tweets per articles and the bibliometric citations in articles with a radiation oncology focus. We found a significant positive correlation (r \u2265 0.55). The correlation was strongest for the top 10 oncology journals (r \u2265 0.81) and less but still significant for Brachytherapy (r \u2265 0.62). The correlation for the Red J and the Green J was not always significant and was dependent on the quotation index used. We believe that our data show that Twitter plays an important role in disseminating radiation oncology publications, across many journals. Twitter mentions may represent one of the many factors that contribute to the subsequent citation frequency of an article. There are likely other factors such as the notoriety of the author which can influence the number of citations. Therefore, our analysis can only show a correlation that is not necessarily a cause for more frequent citations.\n\nOur results are similar to the recent article by Hayon et al 7 which evaluated the impact of Twitter in Urology. They studied the relationship between the number of Twitter mentions and the number of academic citations in urologic publications. Twitter mentions were associated with a higher citation of the article. Interestingly, they found that their authors tweeted only 8.9% of papers and when an author tweeted their own article, the number of citations increased to about the double. The correlation between the number of tweets and the number of citations in general, not specific for a medical specialty, have also been analyzed in the article of Eysenbach. 1 They found that the number of tweets in the first 3 days of paper publication of an article was predictive of the number of subsequent citations. In general, they found a moderate and statistically significant correlation (r = 0.42 to 0.72) between the number of tweets and citations.\n\nWe found that the year of analysis of published articles was very important for measuring the impact of Twitter on citations. When we initially embarked on this project, we first started reviewing the January 2017 edition of the Red J (corresponding to a 2016 electronic publication) to allow for  sufficient time-lapse for these articles to be cited. We identified that <40% of the 2017 articles were tweeted at all. For this reason, we instead decided to analyze articles published in the January/February 2018 issues (electronic publication in 2017). We found that for these issues, 71% of all articles were tweeted. This suggests an important increase of recent Twitter use in radiation oncology. Hayon et al 7 analyzed articles published in a paper in January 2015 and found that 73% of articles had at least 1 Twitter mention. This seemingly small difference in tweeted articles is partly explained by the fact that the number of tweeted articles varied considerably between radiation oncology journals. Articles in Brachytherapy received at least 1 tweet in only 26% of articles, while all the articles (100%) in the Green J and 93% in the Red J received at least 1 tweet. Furthermore, in a recent article from Ciprut et al 8 the number of followers of a Twitter user had a stronger correlation with the US News and World Report (USNWR) reputation score (0.449, P < 0.01) than the number of tweets (0.333, P < 0.05). We found that the number of tweets (r = 0.55, P < 0.001) was a better predictor of the number of citations than the number of followers of a tweeter (r = 0.45, P < 0.001). Hayon et al 7 observed that 74% of Twitter activity occurs during the electronic release of an article (ie, before the print publication date). These were no data were available on Twitter activity during the electronic release of a paper in Altmetric.\n\nThe prepublication buzz could be an interesting alternative metric to assess the academic impact of a paper much earlier than the citation score, given that citation score takes time to obtain. One of the definitions of a buzz is the number of Tweets within the first 3 days of a paper-article publication which in turn can predict subsequently highly cited articles. 1 This metric is not provided by Altmetric. We, therefore, decided to define a prepublication buzz as an article that had at least 10 tweets before print publication. This was an arbitrarily chosen definition that we believe reflects a high interest in an article on Twitter and is metric easily reproducible in future publications. Such a buzz effect was present in only 11% of all articles.\n\nThe best tool to analyze the number of citations is not yet defined. As shown in Table 2, there are variations in the correlation between the number of tweets and the number of citations for the Red J and the Green J depending on whether it was measured with Scopus or Google Scholar. This difference could be explained by the fact that Scopus and Google Scholar use different databases for their analysis. Shultz 9 explained that Google Scholar includes resources beyond a simple analysis of citations in journals.\n\nThe main limitation of this study is that we were not able to identify whether Twitter mentions had a direct impact on the citations or whether papers that were already considered more impactful, were, therefore, tweeted more often. It is likely that both factors actually interplay. Another limitation is that we were only able to analyze a limited number of journals. The Altmetric company maintains that its data is fully auditable. Generally, any metric, including citations can be manipulated. The Altmetric company states that it takes measures to prevent \"gaming of tweets\" which means that somebody finds ways to alter trends on Twitter and therefore inflating artificially the Altmetric Attention Score.\n\nFurthermore, the incentive for manipulations is not that high because of the present lack of importance in academia to have favorable numbers in Altmetric. In the future, a further interesting point would be to evaluate the substance of tweets discussing an article, including whether a tweet simply promotes an article versus scholarly discussion of an article, and whether this qualitative difference may have a bigger influence on the distribution and scientific citation of those articles. For example, one could separate the tweets into categories such as descriptive, opinion tweets, whether other physicians were tagged, a review, critique, or simply sharing of an article link.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\n\nWe found that in radiation oncology, 71% of articles were tweeted at least once and 11% had at least 10 Twitter mentions even before paper publication. The number of Twitter mentions of a scientific article was correlated with a higher number of academic citations. Twitter has the advantage of reaching a larger target audience than a scientific journal with its limited often subscription-based and specialty-specific audience. Twitter metrics could represent a new way of weighing the influence of articles published in scientific journals and may serve as an early indicator of later academic impact.\n\nTABLE 3 . 10\n310Geographic Location of First Author and Distribution of Anayzed Articles of the 34 Articles With \u2265\n\nTABLE 1 .\n1Baseline Characteristics of Analyzed ArticlesBrachyth J \nGreen J \nRed J \nTop 10 \nTotal \nP* \n\nNo. articles analyzed per journal \n61 \n49 \n55 \n13 \n178 \nSex of corresponding author (%) \n0.4* \u2021 \nWomen \n26 \n41 \n27 \n23 \n30 \nMen \n67 \n59 \n67 \n69 \n65 \nUnknown sex \n7 \n0 \n6 \n8 \n5 \nCitations in: \nGoogle Scholar, median (IQR) \n4 (2-5) \n7 (3-10) \n4 (3-8) \n13 (7-29) \n4 (2-8) \n< 0.001 \u2020 \n\u2265 10 \n5% \n31% \n18% \n62% \n36 (20%) \n< 0.001* \nScopus, median (IQR) \n2 (1-4) \n4 (2-9) \n3 (1-7) \n9 (3-24) \n3 (1-7) \n< 0.001 \u2020 \n\u2265 10 \n3% \n20% \n18% \n46% \n28 (16%) \n< 0.001* \nNo. tweets, median (IQR) \n0 (0-1) \n2 (2-10) \n3 (1-9) \n17 (3-46) \n2 (0-7) \n< 0.001 \u2020 \n\u2265 10 tweets \nn = 2 (3%) \n12 (25%) \n12 (22%) \n8 (62%) \n34 (19%) \n< 0.001* \nNo tweets \nn = 45 (74%) \n0% \n4 (7%) \n2 (15%) \n51 (29%) \n< 0.001* \nImpressions \u00a7, median (IQR) \n0 (0-96) \n1798 (264-15,324) 2371 (177-15,582) 885,207 (16,259-157,723) 524 (0-9810) < 0.001 \u2020 \n\n\nTABLE 2 .\n2Correlation Between Number of Tweets and Number of Citations in Google Scholar and Scopus for Each Journal (Pearson Correlation Coefficient)Brachytherapy \nGreen J \nRed J \nTop 10 \nTotal Correlation Journals-Tweets \nImpressions* \n\nQuotations in Google Scholar \nr \n0.64 \n0.31 \n0.2 \n0.81 \n0.55 \n0.49 \nP \n< 0.001 \n0.03 \n0.14 \n< 0.001 \n< 0.001 \n< 0.001 \nQuotations in Scopus \nr \n0.62 \n0.26 \n0.47 \n0.83 \n0.59 \n0.51 \nP \n< 0.001 \n0.07 \n< 0.001 \n< 0.001 \n< 0.001 \n< 0.001 \n\n*Impressions: total number of followers of people who tweeted this article. \nSignificant correlations (P < 0.05) are in bold. \n\n\nACKNOWLEDGMENTThe authors would like to thank Stacy Konkiel, Director of Research Relations, Altmetric for her explanations on the functioning of Altmetric.
