(2020)  Prediction of snow water equivalent using artificial neural network and adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system with two sampling schemes in semi-arid Region of Iran. Journal of\n\nIntroduction\n\nInformation about snow water equivalent (SWE) in mountainous areas is necessary in water resources management. Also, assessing the snow distribution in snowy areas because of its effect on numerous components including rate of erosion (Pomeroy and Gray 1995), temperature and soil moisture (Groffman et al. 2001), plant survival (Keller et al. 2002;Wipf et al. 2009) and hydrological response of rivers (Pomeroy et al. 2004; Barnett et al. 2005;Vafakhah et al. 2015) is so important.\n\nBecause of economic restrictions, safety issues, harsh weather and impassability of mountainous areas, SWE is difficult and time consuming to be measured (DeWalle and Rango 2008). Therefore, predicting SWE based on effective methods is essential. Additionally, due to multiplicity of topographic and climatic factors affecting on the distribution of snow, the study of snow spatial changes, and relationship between the SWE and effective factors is nonlinear and complex (Marofi et al. 2011). Accordingly, it is necessary to apply the artificial intelligence models such as artificial neural network (ANN) and adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS). Most studies in modeling of snow parameters have tended to focus on multiple linear regression (MLR) (Sexstone 2012;Karl 2013;Revuelto et al. 2014) and ANN (Marofi et al. 2011;Gharaei-Manesh et al. 2016) rather than ANFIS. Marofi et al. (2011) applied and compared ANN and neural network genetic algorithm (NNGA) to predict spatial distribution of SWE. Gharaei-Manesh et al. (2016) compared ANN and decision tree to estimate spatial distribution of snow depth (SD). Sedighi et al. (2016) investigated the capability of ANN (hyperbolic tangent and sigmoid) and support vector machine (SVM) (regression type-1 and regression type-2) models to simulate the rainfallrunoff process in the snow dominated Roodak watershed in Iran. Their results showed that ANN with the hyperbolic tangent function, and inputs of rainfall-temperature-SWE, and 1-day delay outperformed than other models in predicting river discharge. Snauffer et al. (2018) predicted SWE in a mixed alpine environment in British Colombia using ANN and six gridded SWE products. ANNs using multiple gridded products as predictors achieved better results than those using single products. Bair et al. (2018) conducted a research in Afghanistan and the Sierra Nevada USA in order to simulate SWE using physiographic and remotely sensed data throughout the snowmelt season using bagged regression trees and ANN. Both of those methods produced similar mean results.\n\nIn many studies, especially natural resources and environmental studies, sampling usually is carried out systematically, randomly or combination of these two patterns. Due to high change of SD, even at a short distance, these patterns cannot represent the SD variations in the study area; consequently, the snow sampling pattern can have a great role in this regard. Therefore, in this research, a relatively modern sampling pattern called Latin hypercube sampling (LHS) that so far has been used only for the soil digital mapping (Gharaei-Manesh et al. 2016) is used, and its result is compared to the systematic random sampling pattern.\n\nLiterature review reveals that no previous study has investigated the LHS pattern in modeling of SWE using ANN, ANFIS and regression methods. Hence, two primary objectives of this study are: (1) to evaluate the accuracy of ANN, ANFIS and stepwise regression approaches for SWE modeling, and (2) to compare the effect of two sampling patterns namely LHS and systematic random sampling on the accuracy of ANN, ANFIS and stepwise regression approaches for SWE modeling.\n\n\nStudy Area\n\nThe study area is located in Zanjan province of Iran (48\u00b021\u2032-48\u00b031\u2032E longitude and 36\u00b01\u2032-36\u00b09\u2032N latitude) with 104.55 km 2 in area. The mean annual precipitation of the area is 418 mm and its elevation ranges from 1650 to 2809 m. The mean annual temperature, average maximum temperature in the hottest month, and average minimum temperature in the coldest month are 8.48\u00b0C, 37.27\u00b0C and -5.3\u00b0C, respectively. Based on the Ambrege climatic classification, the climate of the study area is cold and semi-arid. Snowfall is the main source of Sohrevard River, which is used for agricultural, fishery, recreational and drinking purposes. The sampling area was selected due to access routes to the sampling area, security issues and the purpose of the research. In addition, personnel and financial facilities were considered. Considering these factors, the selected sampling area covers about 190 ha ( Figure 1).\n\n\nMethodology\n\nBased on the topographic map with a scale of 1:25000 obtained from Iran National Cartographic Center, a digital elevation model (DEM) with a pixel size of 10\u00d710 m was created using ArcGIS software. Slope and aspect maps of the study area in degree were then derived from DEM. By combining these two maps, northness and eastness maps were extracted through ArcGIS (Douglas 2006). Northness was obtained by multiplying sine (slope) by cosine (aspect) (Douglas 2006), while the eastern was created by multiplying sine (slope) by sine (aspect). Variability of these two factors is between -1 and +1. Topographic position index (TPI) (Revuelto 2014), profile curvature (Pr) and plan curvature (Pl) maps were derived using SAGA software (Gharaei-Manesh et al. 2016). TPI offers information about the relative position of each pixel to surrounding pixel at defined scale. Positive and negative values mean that pixel is higher or lower than the surrounding pixels, respectively, and zero value indicates a flat surface or the middle part of the slope (Revuelto et al. 2014). Finally, solar radiation map of the study area for 5-11 February, 2016 was derived using DEM within the GIS environment.\n\n\nSampling patterns\n\n\nSystematic random sampling\n\nIn this research, sampling points' distance was 100 m for systematic random sampling pattern but rows distance varied from 100 to 150 m to include the hills. Therefore, coordinates of 140 sampling points of SD and 10 random points (total = 150 sampling points) based on systematic random sampling pattern were transformed into global positioning system (GPS, map76CSX).\n\n\nLatin hypercube sampling\n\nIn LHS a randomized design of classified is implemented that provides an effective relationship between sampling points and environmental variables. A square grid containing sample position on one side, and effective factors (environmental data) on the other side, form a Latin square with a sample in each row and column. In LHS with multivariate distribution, when the number of samples is equal to the number of classes, the probability of sample presence on each class 1/n and samples are distributed in a maximum extent (McBratney et al. 2003). Therefore, LHS pattern is determined based on the change in the effective factors. Effective factors in this research are elevation (El), slope (S), northness (N), eastness (E), profile curvature (Pr), plan curvature (Pl) and TPI. In the next step, coordinates of 150 sampling points of SD based on LHS were selected using raster's maps (7 layers). Then its map was extracted using the related codes in Matlab software, and afterwards, it was transferred into GPS. Location of SD sampling points in systematic random sampling and LHS patterns are shown in Figure 2 (a) and (b), respectively.\n\n\nMeasurement of snow depth (SD)\n\nAfter the snow fall in the study area on February 7, 2016, SD was measured with two aforementioned sampling patterns by a team of climbers and experts on February 8 and 9, 2016. First, the ground location of the selected points for sampling in the study area was determined by GPS, and then the SD at each point was measured by a graded ruler. Considering GPS error of about 5 m, and due to changes in the SD, even at 5 m, the SD was measured at four surrounding points with 5 m radius, and the average of five numbers calculated (Marofi et al. 2011). Besides, eighteen randomly selected samples of snow density were measured. First, a container full of water was weighted, then it was emptied and was filled with uniform snow without compaction, and was weighted again by a gravimeters. Snow density was obtained by calculating the ratio of the weights of the container filled with snow to the container filled with water. Figure 3 shows the location of snow density sampling points.\n\nIt is understandable that the coefficient of variation (CV) of snow density compared with the SD is very low (CV of snow density is close to 7%, while CV of SD is 60% and 70% for LHS and systematic random sampling patterns, respectively).\n\nTherefore, the average of all 18 snow density samples in the study area was calculated (Marofi et al. 2011). At last, SWE values were obtained by multiply the average of snow density and SD for the sampling points.\n\n\nExtracting and selecting input variables\n\nAt this step, using the study area raster layers of DEM, slope, aspect, northness, eastness, profile curvature, plan curvature, TPI and solar radiation index, the numerical values of the studied variables at the measured SD points were derived using SAGA and GIS software's. Collinearity among independent variables was controlled using tolerance index and variance inflation factor (VIF). For lack of collinearity among independent variables, VIF should be less than 2.5 and tolerance index should be more than 0.4. It was found that by excluding solar radiation variable, other independent variables have no collinearity together. In the series of SWE data, the values that were far more than three times of standard deviation of averaged data (deviated data) were removed (2 data from each dataset) thus for each sampling pattern, 148 samples of SWE remained. Given that in regression method for Pearson's correlation,  data must be normal. Therefore, Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) test was applied to detect the normality of SWE data. At last, the Pearson's correlation between dependent variable (SWE) and independent variables (7 variables) was used for two sampling patterns.\n\n\nSelected models\n\n\nArtificial Neural Network (ANN)\n\nThe ANN used in this study has three layers includes an input layer that distributes data in network, a hidden layer that processes data, and an output layer that determinates the results. Previous studies showed that a hidden layer in ANN structure can estimate each complex and nonlinear function (Cybenko 1989;Hornik et al. 1989;Zhang 1998). The first application of ANN was carried out by introducing multilayer perceptrons (MLP). In such networks, it has been proved that among the learning algorithms, back propagation algorithm with three layers is satisfactory in solving the complex engineering problems (Nourani et al. 2011).\n\n\nAdaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS)\n\nThe ANFIS as a combination of the ANN and the fuzzy logic is a new method for solving complex problems that either there are no specific algorithms for solving them, or their routine techniques require long procedures and time. ANFIS architecture used in this study is based on Sugeno model with two fuzzy if-then rules, and is shown as:\n\nRule 1 \u2236 If is and is ; then 1\n\nRule 2 \u2236 If is and is ; then 2 where and are the inputs, and are the input membership functions, , and are the parameters of the output function which are determined during the training process, Z1 and Z2 are outputs of the fourth layer, Z is output. Generally, the ANFIS structure is composed of five layers (Figure 4).\n\nA comprehensive presentation of ANFIS for hydrological simulation can be found in the literature (Nayak et al. 2004;Keskin et al. 2006;Shu and Ouarda 2008;Vafakhah 2012).\n\n\nData standardization\n\nOriginal data reduces the network speed and precision. Since each parameter has its own division, data are standardized to equalize their variation range to not reduce the network weight (Kisi 2008). Therefore, the SWE related to two sampling patterns were standardized (Liu and Anantharaman 1994;Igel and H\u00fcsken 2003;Rezaeian Zadehet al. 2010) based on Equation (3).\n0.9 0.05 3\nwhere is standardized input of , and are the maximum and minimum values, respectively. The ranges of all data were thus between 0.05 and 0.95. Data are randomly divided into three classes. 70% of the data were used for training, 15% for validation, and 15% for testing. For finding the order of input variables, and the suitable combination of inputs in predicting SWE, sensitivity analysis was implemented in NeuroSolution software. In the next step, necessary codes were written in Matlab software, and independent variables were imported step by step to the Matlab software. The most sensitive independent variable along dependent variable was imported then; the variable ranked in the next place was added to the independent variables etc. Hyperbolic tangent nonlinear function (Equation (4)) was used as The number of neurons in hidden layer varied from 2 to 25, and the most suitable number were determined by trial and error. The number of neurons in input layer varied from 1 to 7 depending on the input combinations, while the number of neurons in output layer was always one. For training of the network, back propagation training algorithm was used. In this algorithm after determining the output of the network, first, the weight of the final layer, and then the weights of the previous layers are corrected. In ANFIS method, due to some structures, independent input variables can be numerous (7 input variables in the last state), the calculations can be very high, and sometimes the network response can lead to irrational output. Therefore, sub-clustering method is used. By changing the radius of influences; the number of different membership functions is selected. For each compound in ANN and ANFIS, the model was run several times.\n\n\nStepwise regression\n\nIn the regression method, the data are out of standard condition and through stepwise regression, and based on the divided data for modeling; the most suitable model was determined in SWE prediction for two sampling patterns.\n\n\nEfficiency comparison of different methods with statistical criteria\n\nThe evaluation of the ANN, ANFIS and regression models were performed using statistical criteria including mean bias error (MBE), mean absolute error (MAE), root mean square error (RMSE), correlation coefficient (r), relative error percentage (RE%) and Nash-Sutcliffe coefficient efficiency (NS) (Nash and Sutcliffe 1970) (Equations (5) -(10)).\nMBE \u2211 5 MAE \u2211 \u2502 \u2502 6 RMSE \u2211 (7) \u2211 \u2211 (8) RE% 100 (9) NS 1 \u2211 \u2211(10)\nwhere: and are the observed and estimated values, respectively. a nd are the average of and , and is the total number of data.\n\n\nResults and Discussion\n\n\nSnow depth and snow density\n\nDescriptive statistics of SD and snow density using systematic random sampling and LHS patterns are given in Tables 1 and 2. According to Table 1, there is a significant difference between CV of measured snow density and SD using two sampling patterns. This result is in agreement with the findings given by Molotch  Marofi et al. (2011). The effect of topography factors on SD is probably higher than that on snow density.\n\nThe results obtained from the calculation of SWE and normality test are given in Table 3.\n\nAs shown in Table 3, SWE has been normally distributed from the LHS pattern, while they are not normal in the systematic random sampling pattern. Therefore, a logarithmic transformation was applied to SWE data obtained from the latter pattern.\n\n\nThe relationship between snow water equivalent and studied parameters\n\nThe results of Pearson correlation between Logarithm of SWE data (LogSWE) and studied variables (systematic random sampling pattern) and SWE and studied variables (LHS pattern) are given in Table 4.\n\nAs it was stated in the methodology section, due to lack of normality in SWE data of systematic random sampling, these data were normalized using logarithmic conversion. Therefore, for these data, correlation between independent parameters with LogSWE was determined.\n\nAs Table 4 shows, the profile curvature and TPI parameters have no significant correlation with SWE in both sampling patterns in the study area. Most probably, these parameters are influenced by other parameters. The rest of studied parameters (6 parameters) have significant effect on the SWE. The correlation of elevation, slope and northness is positive, and the correlation of eastness, plan curvature and solar radiation is negative.\n\nAs can be seen from the Table 4, elevation parameter has a direct relationship with SWE, which is due to temperature reduction with increase in elevation, and condensation of air humidity, and snow form of precipitation. Slope parameter also has a direct relationship with SWE. Since in the study area, steep slopes are located at higher elevations, thus, the effect of slope on SD and SWE is because of the effect of elevation. Northness parameter has also a direct relationship with SWE, and moving from North to South, as northness reduces (maximum northness, theoretically is +1, when the direction of the pixel is the direction of the North, and slope is 90 degree, and minimum northness is -1, when the direction of the pixel is the direction of South, and slope is 90 degree), SD and SWE decrease. Conversely, eastness parameter has an indirect effect on SD and SWE. As eastness reduces (maximum eastness, theoretically is +1, when the direction of the pixel is the direction of the east, and slope is 90 degree, and minimum eastness, theoretically is -1, when the direction of the pixel is the direction of west, and slope is 90 degree), SD and SWE increase. This is probably due to received lower energy and less melting of snow in the north direction to south direction, and west direction to east direction, even in a short time (snow measurement time). It should be noted that in the northness and eastness, in addition to the direction, slope degree is also effective. Solar radiation has indirect relationship with SD and SWE. The reason is the different effects of solar radiation in melting of snow at . Plan curvature has an indirect relationship with SD and SWE (positive curvature means convex, therefore has less SD, and negative curvature means concave, therefore has more SD). Similarly, profile curvature has no significant relationship with the SWE, however its relationship direction is indirect.\n\nLikewise, TPI has no significant relationship with SWE, but then relationship direction is indirect. Positive TPI means the center of that pixel is higher than the center of other pixels, and consequently has less SD and SWE and visa versa for the negative TPI. Moreover, the given tables show that correlation rank between SWE and studied parameters is different for two sampling patterns, because in systematic random method, sampling is carried out at regular interval (100-150 m) that there may not be a change in some variables at different sampling points, while there may be many changes in other variables.\n\nConsequently, the correlation between LogSWE and studied parameters is not reasonable in comparison with LHS, but in LHS method, sampling is done from different classes, the correlation between SWE and studied parameters is thus logical, and this is one of the advantages of LHS method in comparison to the systematic random method.\n\nSuitable quantitative equation between SWE and independent variables was determined using stepwise regression. The resultant equations are presented in the form of Equations 11 and 12 for systematic random and LHS patterns, respectively. is snow water equivalent (cm), . is elevation (m), is slope (degree), is northness, and . is plan curvature (radian/m).\n\n\nSensitivity analysis\n\nThe results of sensitivity analysis of the SWE to the studied variables for systematic random sampling and LHS patterns are given in Figure 5 (a) and (b), respectively.\n\nAs can be seen in Figures 6 and 7, data obtained from both two sampling patterns have the highest sensitivity to the elevation, which is in consistent with Marofi et al. (2011) findings. In addition, the LHS and the systematic random sampling patterns have the least sensitivity to the profile curvature and plan curvature, respectively. From the correlation coefficient point of view, profile curvature also has no significant correlation with SWE in both sampling patterns in the study area. In LHS sampling pattern, elevation variable  has the highest Pearson's correlation with SWE, and in systematic random sampling pattern, also there is a relatively high correlation between elevation variable and LogSWE in comparison to other variables.\n\nThe computed SWE and their corresponding observations in testing data set are given for ANN in systematic random sampling pattern in Figure 6(a) and LHS pattern in Figure 6(b), ANFIS in systematic random sampling in Figure 6(c) and LHS patterns in Figure 6(d) and regression method in systematic random sampling in Figure 6(e) and LHS patterns in Figure 6(f).\n\nAlso for better comparison, histogram of the relative error percent (RE %) for the computed SWE using different methods with two sampling patterns is given in (Figure 7).\n\n\nEfficiency of different methods for SWE prediction\n\nThe predicted SWE using ANN, ANFIS and regression models with two sampling patterns was evaluated by the statistical criteria so as to choose the optimal one. The summary of results are given in Tables 5-7. As can be seen from Tables 5-7, in both sampling patterns, ANFIS and ANN models are better than regression method for predicting the SWE. It may be due to the complexity and nonlinear trend of spatial distribution of SWE, so the relatively high error obtained by the regression method in comparison to the ANN and ANFIS in predicting SWE is expectable, because the artificial intelligence methods are more capable for predicting nonlinear phenomena in comparison to statistical methods. Given that, since the ANFIS model has the ability to teach the neural network and inference capability fuzzy logic, it was expected to have higher efficiency in SWE prediction. Nevertheless, there are no high differences between ANN and ANFIS models using two sampling patterns data in prediction of SWE in this research. However, comparing two methods in prediction of SWE requires further researches.\n\nRegarding the statistical criteria, LHS pattern compared to the systematic random sampling pattern is better in all three models of ANN, ANFIS and stepwise regression for predicting SWE. High efficiency of LHS pattern for soil digital mapping has been concluded from the study of Minasny and McBratney (2007). Since, in the LHS pattern, location of sampling points have been determined based on changes of effective factors on SD and SWE, therefore, the variance of samples are closer to the community variance, and taken samples in this pattern better represent the studied community (sampling area). In LHS pattern, samples are taken from different classes of factors affecting on SD and SWE, consequently, the relationship between dependent variable and independent variables is more suitable, and the SWE prediction is more accurate.\n\nComparison between the maximum computed values with their corresponding observed data (5 high values) and minimum computed values with their corresponding observed data (5 low values) in ANN, ANFIS and regression models in both sampling patterns shows that for the most data, high observed values are underestimated, and vice versa overestimated at low values, in other words, all three models have limited the range of responses. High error in neural network for prediction of high values can be due to its property such as high processing speed, the ability of learning the pattern, the ability of generalizing the pattern after learning, flexibility against unwanted errors, and lack of significant disruption because of the network weights distribution.\n\nTables 5 and 6 show that increasing the number of input data (independent variables) do not necessarily improve the results of ANN and ANFIS models. As can be seen from the Table 6, input combination for both two sampling patterns of LHS and systematic random in ANFIS model is similar.\n\n\nConclusions\n\nThis research showed that SWE can be estimated with reasonable accuracy applying three models of ANN, ANFIS and stepwise regression in the study area. However, due to the nonlinearity of the snow spatial distribution, the accuracy of the regression model is relatively less compared to the ANN and ANFIS models. The basis of all three methods for estimating the SWE is founding a relationship between the SWE and the effective factors that can easily be extracted from the DEM.   Table 5 for definition of variables and meanings of abbreviations. Bold values indicate the best performance. Moreover, according to the results of this research, LHS pattern accuracy is relatively better than the systematic random sampling pattern in all three methods in estimating SWE. Since the comparison of these two sampling patterns in prediction of SWE using three models has been done for the first time, it is recommended that the same methods and patterns be applied in other regions particularly in regions with higher snowfall frequency and longer lasting snowfall period.\n\nFigure 1\n1Geographic location of the study area as a part of the Sohrevard watershed.\n\nFigure 2\n2Location of snow depth (SD) sampling points using systematic random sampling (a) and Latin hypercube sampling (b) patterns in a part of the Sohrevard watershed.\n\nFigure 3\n3Location of the snow density sampling points in a part of the Sohrevard watershed.\n\nFigure 4\n4Typical ANFIS architecture used in this study. activation function in hidden layer.
