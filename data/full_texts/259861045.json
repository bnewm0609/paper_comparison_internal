INTRODUCTION\n\nThe production system's equipment is vulnerable to wear over time because of repeated processing cycles, which reduces technical efficiency relative to ideal circumstances [1]. Therefore, maintenance is essential in the industrial environment to increase safety and minimize system downtime [2]. Nowadays, machines and systems are increasingly connected, making data, a critical component of data-driven models, more accessible [3]. Predictive maintenance and condition monitoring are data-based models that are essential industrial applications of machine learning (ML) methods. Predictive maintenance aims at optimizing the usage of resources by predicting upcoming failures just-intime. Experiments with ML models showed superior results in this field [4] [5] so many companies are interested in using ML in their use cases. These models use signals from different system sensors to predict possible faults and failures. Sensors like vibration, current, voltage, and temperature provide data in the form of time series during a process [6]. Usually, an industrial application utilizes hundreds or thousands of sensors for monitoring and controlling the systems. Depending on the sensor type, the relevant data for ML applications should be sampled at relatively high sampling rates, e.g., 24k and 48k for vibration signals [7] [8].\n\nConsidering the high number of sensors and long running time of the industrial systems, data processing and communication can be bottlenecks to utilizing ML models. Fig. 1 depicts the hierarchy of computing power, memory usage, storage capacity, and response latency that is commonly used in implementing ML solutions for condition monitoring. Embedding the model in edge devices offers a solution by decreasing the amount of data transmission and enabling edge devices to independently perform some tasks [9]. However, hardware limitations such as power consumption and size can limit the complexity of the model when deployed in edge devices. An alternative solution is to simplify the model for edge devices and distribute the ML model to higher levels, such as the fog or cloud, where hardware constraints are less limiting [10] AutoML is a machine learning technique that optimizes hyperparameters within a defined search space to find the best solution for a given task. It provides a more efficient solution compared to traditional machine learning as it eliminates the time-consuming process of manual feature engineering. The AutoML search space can be defined using a traditional ML approach, consisting of a sequential pipeline of methods, including feature extraction (FE), feature selection (FS), and classification or regression blocks (FESC/R) [11]. While conventional machine learning methods can be used in AutoML's search space, another popular option is to utilize artificial neural networks (ANN). ANNs have demonstrated remarkable performance in various fields such as computer vision [12], speech recognition [13], and predictive maintenance [14]. However, they present some difficulties in industrial applications due to their complex and hard-tointerpret black box nature [15], [16], as well as their tendency to perform poorly in multi-domain problems with limited data observations [17]. In practice even if AutoML does not find the best model, the result can be a very good starting point for model development [18]. This work was in part supported by the German ministry for education and research (BMBF) within the project \"KI-MUSIK4.0\" under code 16ME0077. This full text paper was peer-reviewed at the direction of IEEE Instrumentation and Measurement Society prior to the acceptance and publication.\n\nThis study aims to select a versatile FE method that can be implemented in hardware, with the goal of reducing inference costs and enabling mass production through ASIC implementation. A universal FE method has the potential to be applied in a range of applications, making it a valuable addition to the field. Although there are similar works in comparison and benchmarking of ML methods for fault detection and time series signals, to the best of our knowledge, this work is the most comprehensive in terms of the number of use cases and methods. Esakimuthu Pandarakone et al. [19] compared classical ML classifiers with convolutional neural networks in detecting bearing faults in induction motors. Buckley et al. [20] used two datasets to conduct interesting experiments on benchmark feature extraction and selection methods for structural health monitoring. West et al. [21] compared multiple FE methods on two time-series datasets. Finally, while this work is based on AutoML from [5], we expanded it by implementing new scenarios, methods, and studies to find FEs with lower computational complexity.\n\nTo compare FE methods, we ran 70 combinations of FESC methods on 92 different data scenarios generated from public datasets in this field, in total 6440 cross-validation of the methods (cf. section II and table I). The rest of the paper is organized as follows: Section II provides an overview of the datasets utilized in this study. Section III outlines the machine learning methods applied in the study, while Section IV presents the results. Finally, our conclusion and future works are discussed in Section V.\n\n\nII. DATASETS\n\nThe success of ML-based condition monitoring relies heavily on the quality and quantity of the recorded data, as statistical patterns in the data are used to make predictions. Generally, models tend to perform better when more data is available [22]. Data collection in industrial applications is expensive, time-consuming, and heavily reliant on domain experts. Because the influence of multiple input factors must be considered, e.g., system load or rotational speed in rotary machines, the design of experiments (DoE) is an essential prerequisite for data acquisition in industrial applications. However, due to time and cost constraints in real-world applications, the number of observations in each working condition is usually limited. Dealing with these constraints highlights a common issue with real-world data use cases: domain shift. In supervised ML, there is an important assumption that training, and test data comes from the same distribution. Domain shift or dataset shift occurs when test and train data are from different distributions. For example, a change in the environmental temperature can drift the sensor data and cause a shift in the data distribution. As a result, this issue should be taken into account in DoE, model selection, and validation methods [4].\n\nDifferent datasets from related fields have been selected. All are time series from various sensor recordings. Multiple scenarios from each dataset are generated to cover more machine learning issues. The scenarios are formed by changing the number of sensors, the number of observations, and the validation strategy (table I). When possible, two validation strategies are defined: k-fold random and leaveone-group out (LOGO) validation. The LOGO validation method is the preferable scenario because it shows the effect of changing the background variables (robustness) and domain shift problems (transferability). A group in the LOGO method is a set of observations that are measured with a common background property, e.g., the working temperature, load, or speed. In fact, LOGO cross-validation measures the accuracy of a model in a domain generalization problem.\n\nThe datasets used in this study are the following:\n\n\uf0b7 Case western reserve university bearing dataset (CWRU) [7]. The data are vibration signals from the bearings which are cut into 24k (i.e., 0.5s) slices. Two Binary classification scenarios to detect the ball and inner ring faults are generated. The data are recorded at four different motor loads which are used for the LOGO validation strategy. \uf0b7 ZeMA hydraulic system (HS) [23]. Multiple (17) sensors of an HS testbed were recorded in different fault situations. The accumulator pre-charge pressure is used as the target and the cooler performance (3, 20, and 100 %) as the cross-influence variable for LOGO validation. The single-sensor version of the dataset uses the signals from pressure sensor one only.\n\n\uf0b7 Hydraulic system vibration dataset (HSV) [24]. The same testbed from the HS dataset is used to record vibration (acceleration) signals of the main drive and the drive of the cooling cycle. Two 3-axial MEMS acceleration sensors were used to record the signals and each direction is treated as a separate sensor. The target is 0, 1.3 and 4 volume percent added free air bubbles in relation to the oil flow rate and the crossinfluence variable is the valve performance (73, 85, and 100 %). The single sensor version of the dataset uses the z-axis from the vibration signals of the main drive.\n\n\uf0b7 ZeMA electromechanical cylinder (EC) [25]. The lifetime of an electromechanical cylinder while repeating a fixed working cycle was recorded using 11 sensors. The task is to estimate the lifetime of the device between ten discrete values, '1' means a new device and '10' means a near-failure device. This use case covers just a single device, and only a k-fold validation method is applicable. The single-sensor version of the dataset uses microphone signals only.\n\n\uf0b7 Open guided waves (OGW) [26]. The dataset consists of guided wave-based time series signals at different temperature levels. A detachable aluminum mass was used to simulate delamination damage at four different locations. The four locations of simulated damage positions are used for LOGO validation.\n\n\uf0b7 Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones (HAR) [27]. Six different activities of 30 people have been recorded by smartphone sensors with 50 Hz sampling rate. The task is classifying the activities using 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity (or gyro) sensors. People in the experiment are divided into four groups and the LOGO validation is performed using the defined groups. The single-sensor version of the dataset uses the z-axis signals of the accelerometer only.\n\n\uf0b7 Paderborn University (PU) bearing dataset [8]. It consists of high-frequency recordings of vibration signals and motor currents from 26 faulty and 6 healthy states of bearings. The signals were measured in four different working conditions which are used for LOGO cross-validation in this use case.\n\n\uf0b7 Naphthalene concentration (Naph) [28]. The data set consists of a gas sensor operated with changing temperature sampled at 4 Hz; signal patterns were recorded for six concentrations of naphthalene. The measurements were repeated for three levels of ethanol as background or interfering gas. For this use case, ethanol concentrations are used for LOGO crossvalidation.\n\n\uf0b7 Hill Valley dataset (HV) [29]. HV is a simple dataset; each observation has 100 points resembling either a hill or a valley. Two versions of this dataset exist, with and without noise. HV scenarios have just a single \"sensor\" and only k-fold validation is applicable.\n\n\uf0b7 Dataset from an industrial partner (Gear). The dataset consists of signals from an end-of-line test bed that tests a specific model of a gearbox. Five different signals were measured: vibration, current, revolutions per minute, torque, and voltage. The tested devices are labeled by a physical model. The task for this use case is defined as a supervised binary classification to detect faulty devices from healthy ones. The single-sensor version of the dataset uses only the vibration signals, and only k-fold validation is applicable in this use case.\n\n\nIII. METHODS\n\n\nA. AutoML toolbox\n\nCondition monitoring and predictive maintenance can benefit from a variety of ML methods and algorithms. A solid traditional ML approach consists of using sequential blocks of methods to build a model (FESC/R pipeline). In this pipeline FE is typically the block applied to the raw data; FE is a reliable approach to reducing data dimensions [5]. Note that finding the right combination of methods for the target use case is not always easy. Traditional data-driven condition monitoring and predictive maintenance methods are based on excessive manual feature engineering which makes the process of model development expert-dependent and timeconsuming [11]. The challenge of the traditional approach was a strong motivation to utilize automated data-driven models as an alternative.\n\nThis study employs an AutoML framework comprised of traditional methods for searching across multiple FESC/R stack of methods [5]. The first reason for the chosen method is the previously mentioned issues with ANNs in the target applications. Conventional ML performed better in condition monitoring applications with domain shift problems, and their decisions are also easier to interpret. [17]. The flexibility of building a model based on extracted features is the second reason for this method selection. Features have fewer dimensions than raw data and can be used by various models such as ANNs or ensemble methods, which are considered the state-of-the-art in tabular data [30].\n\nA specifically modified version of the AutoML toolbox [5], developed in MATLAB, is applied to all the generated scenarios which are mentioned in the previous section. The toolbox systematically evaluates and compares all combinations of FE, FS, and classification methods for each scenario. Table II lists the various methods that are evaluated using the toolbox.  In comparison to the previous implementation of the AutoML toolbox in [5], this study extends the feature extraction methods to include NoFE and TFEx, the feature selection methods to include NoFS and spearman, and also includes SVM as an additional classifier. The toolbox tests all combinations of FE, FS, and classification methods (70 combinations in total) and the best model is identified based on the cross-validation error. In this study, we have not used hyperparameter tuning for each method explicitly, only the best number of features is defined through a brute-force search after the FS step. Besides outstanding results of the toolbox, which were previously reported in multiple studies, such as [5] and [23], the interpretability and explainability of the models are additional motivations to use it in this study [16]. Particularly in critical industrial applications, like predictive maintenance, interpretability is a key factor for selecting a model to be deployed. \nCWRU-B x x - x x CWRU-IR x x - x x HS x x x x x HSV x x x x x EC x - x x x OGW x x - x x HAR x x x x x PU x x x x x Naph x x - x x HV with- noise x - - x - HV no- noise x - - x x a\n\nB. TFEx\n\nThe TFEx feature extraction method extracts statistical features from both the time and frequency domains of a time series including the root-mean-square (RMS), variance, linear slope, maximum, minimum, position of the maximum, skewness, kurtosis, and peak-to-RMS ratio for a total of 18 features. The specific feature functions were selected after thorough testing and evaluation in preliminary experiments. It is important to strike a balance between enhancing accuracy and increasing computational complexity when incorporating other commonly used feature functions for time series analysis in our evaluations. This is crucial in view of the hardware constraints for implementing the FE block.\n\nTo add temporal resolution and improve scalability of the method, the signal and its FFT transformation are divided into a predefined number of slices (10 slices are used in this study), and the features are computed for each slice separately. The final feature set for an input signal is obtained by concatenating the features from all slices from the time and frequency domains. The number of features is represented by (1), where nFunc is the number of feature functions and nTime and nFreq represent the number of time and frequency segments, respectively: nFeat = nFunc \u00d7 (nTime + nFreq)\n\n(1)\n\n\nC. Simplified versions of TFEx\n\nTFEx is a relatively easy-to-implement and computationally cheap method, but we aim to go further and test even more streamlined versions of the method. There are two elements to be modified in the TFEx extractor: the FFT length and the features used in the extractor. The FFT length is a crucial limitation in the hardware implementation of the method and in the original version of TFEx there is no limit for the signal length which is not always feasible to implement in an edge device. In order to overcome the limitation imposed by the length of the FFT in the hardware implementation of TFEx, we have applied a windowing technique to the input data. Without any overlap, the input data is divided into sections and each section is processed individually. The features from each slice are then concatenated to form the final feature vector. The window sizes we use range from 2 5 to 2 17 , which is deemed feasible for practical implementation in edge devices. Downsampling is another possible solution to reduce the signal length, therefore we test the scenarios with different resampling factors to have data lengths between 2 7 to 2 17 (or the original length if it is shorter than 2 17 ).\n\nThe next factors to be tested are the feature functions used in the extractor, i.e., RMS, variance, skewness, kurtosis, peak to RMS, and slope of the signal. Table III describes \n\n\nD. Critical difference diagrams\n\nCritical difference (CD) diagrams are well-known tools to compare the results of multiple methods in different scenarios. In this study, we used a CD based on the Friedman test and Wilcoxon-Holm post-hoc analysis to compare the ML algorithms [35]. The diagram is a visual representation of the comparison and plots the average ranks of the tested methods. The best method stands on the right of the graph and the worst goes to the left. A line connects a group of methods that are not significantly better based on the comparison.\n\n\nIV. RESULTS\n\nWe aimed to find a suitable FE method for hardware implementation. To evaluate the results of the tested methods, we looked at their first block, the feature extraction block, and considered the best result of each stack. We had seven methods for each scenario, giving us a total of seven different FE options. The results of these tests can be seen in Fig. 2 which shows the CD diagram of all tested results. Our analysis found that, on average, TFEx is the best feature extractor across all tested scenarios. BFC and StatMom were close runners-up, while NoFE performed the worst as expected.\n\nWe tested the simplified versions of TFEx on real-world industrial datasets including CWRU, HS, OGW, EC, HSV, and Gear. To understand the impact of FFT length and signal length on TFEx performance, we generated multiple scenarios through windowing and downsampling. The results, as illustrated in Fig. 3, reveal that the optimal input buffer size, or FFT length, is not necessarily the longest. In fact, in complex cases like OGW, the best results were achieved with an FFT length as short as 128.\n\nThe results indicate a trade-off between buffer size and accuracy of the models. In scenarios such as CWRU, EC, OGW, Gear single, and HS, the original TFEx doesn't always achieve the best results, and the results of the simplified versions are comparable to the best accuracies. This finding is noteworthy because it suggests that computationally expensive features like skewness and kurtosis could potentially be omitted from the hardware implementation. This would result in a more efficient and power-saving FE block for multi-purpose hardware applications, as unused features could be set to sleep mode. Finally, TFEx strikes a balance in terms of memory requirements. It requires only a modest buffer to store the intermediate results of the feature calculation, making it a cost-effective solution for low-cost hardware implementation. Given its strong performance, being interpretable, and straightforward implementation, it presents a viable option for developing low-cost hardware-based monitoring systems across various industrial applications. These findings provide valuable insights for designing and building efficient monitoring systems that can benefit various industries.\n\n\nV. CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORKS\n\nIn this study, a comprehensive evaluation was conducted to identify a suitable FE method for hardware implementation in various applications, including condition monitoring and predictive maintenance. The scenarios were designed taking into account the possibility of domain shift and considering different use cases. The results showed that TFEx, which extracts features from both time and frequency domains, performed best among the tested methods. The method has simple components that can be implemented as hardware modules, and evaluations of the impact of the FFT length indicated that in all tested cases, a shorter FFT length can be used compared to the signal length, leading to a more costefficient hardware-implementation of the FFT block. Our experiments also demonstrated that even a simplified version of TFEx often performed comparably to the original version, making it possible to eliminate computationally intensive features such as skewness and kurtosis in the hardware implementation. In cases where more complex features are needed, they can be added at the cost of increased complexity and power consumption in edge devices.\n\nIn the future, our goal is to compare the performance of classical methods with deep learning techniques. Furthermore, in order to effectively evaluate TFEx's strengths and limitations, we plan to compare its efficiency with other methods in terms of real-time implementation performance, including power consumption, resource requirements, and latency. Additionally, the performance of the feature functions can be tested also based on their domains. Although, in this study, we implicitly compared the performance of individual time, frequency, or time-frequency features by utilizing feature extraction methods from both the time domain (ALA, StatMom) and frequency domain (BFC), the comparison of time and frequency features could be a valuable area for future research. Through these evaluations, we aim to gain a comprehensive understanding of TFEx and lay the foundation for future advancements.\n\nFig. 1 .\n1Edge, fog and cloud computing representation and characteristics.\n\n\nSub-versions of the main scenarios, 80, 50, 30% of the observations\n\n\nthe different versions of TFEx and their respective features used in each version.\n\nTABLE I .\nILIST OF THE DATASETS AND THEIR VARIATIONS THAT ARE USED TO COMPARE THE FE METHODSDataset \nK-Fold LOGO \nMulti a \nSingle b \nSub c \n\n\nTABLE II .\nIILIST OF FE, FS, AND CLASSIFICATION METHODS THAT ARE USED IN THE AUTOML FRAMEWORKFeature extraction methods \n\nNoFE \nNo Feature Extraction \n\nALA \nAdaptive Linear Approximation [31] \n\nBFC \nBest Fourier Coefficients [32] \n\nBDW \nBest Daubechies Wavelets [32] \n\nTFEx \nTime Frequency Feature Extractor \n\nPCA \nPrincipal Component Analysis [33] \n\nStatMom Statistical Moments [5] \n\nFeature selection methods \n\nNoFS \nNo Feature Selection \n\nPearson Pearson correlation coefficient \n\nRELIEFF RELIEFF [34] \n\nRFESVM Recursive Feature Elimination Support Vector Machines [5] \n\nSpearman Spearman correlation coefficient \n\nClassification methods \n\nLDAMahal \nLinear Discriminant Analysis with Mahalanobis distance \nclassification \nSVM \nSupport Vector Machine with a radial basis function kernel \n\n\nTABLE III .\nIIITFEX AND ITS SIMPLIFIED VERSIONS Fig. 2.
