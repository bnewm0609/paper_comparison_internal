These applications use the Dedicated Short Range Communications (DSRC) devices at 5.8 GHz (ISM band). In view of the reliability and success of this technology, the use of such equipment is thus extended to the EFC (Electronic Fee Collection) or e-toll and as well in many other application areas such as fleet management, public transport and parking management. Due to the broad applicability, these equipments are subject to various standards CEN/TC 278, CEN ENV (EN) 12253, ETSI, etc.... The DSRC system consists in a transceiver (reader) and transponders (tags). Industrial approaches are oriented to semipassive transponder technology, which uses the same signal sent by the reader to retransmit, performing a frequency shift and encoding data to be transmitted. This design avoids the use of the local oscillators to generate the RF wave, as in active transponders, and saves electrical energy of batteries. This allows the development of relatively low cost and small size transponders. Despite advances of low-power integrated circuits technology, this concept still requires a lithium battery to operate the transponder for a period of 4-6 years. However, with the expansion of these facilities, it appears that over the years the amount of lithium to destroy has become a crucial problem for the environment. Nowadays designing a completely autonomous DSRC transponder is not feasible, since the amount of energy required is still high (8 mA/3.6 V active mode). Nevertheless, reducing the transponder electrical power consumption, as a solution to at least double the battery life, could be a good start point to improve environment protection.In this thesis we propose a new DSRC transponder with an original statechart that considerably reduces the power consumption. After validation of the new low-power consumption mode, we have investigated the possibility to recharge the battery of the transponder by means of Wireless Energy Harvesting. The DSRC Toll Collection RF link budget has been carried out in order to estimate the amount of energy available when a car with a transponder passes through a toll system. However, RF link budget at 5.8 GHz presents a low power density, since the car does not remain enough in the DSRC antenna's field to proceed to energy harvesting. Therefore, we have explored another ISM frequency, the 2.45 GHz. Thus the Wireless Energy Harvesting chapter aims to further the state of the art by the design and optimization of a novel RF harvesting board. We have demonstrated that an optimum RF-DC load is required in order to achieve high RF-DC conversion efficiency. Several rectifiers and rectennas have been prototyped in order to validate the numerical studies. Finally, the results obtained in this thesis are in the forefront of the State-of-the-Art of Wireless Energy Harvesting for very low available power density.R\u00e9sum\u00e9Afin d'augmenter l'efficacit\u00e9 et la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 du trafic routier, de nouveaux concepts et technologies ont \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9velopp\u00e9s depuis 1992 en Europe pour les applications RTTT (Road Traffic & Transport Telematics). Ces applications utilisent les \u00e9quipements DSRC qui supportent les transmissions \u00e0 courte distance \u00e0 5.8GHz. Vues la fiabilit\u00e9 et le succ\u00e8s de cette technologie, l'utilisation de ces \u00e9quipements est ensuite \u00e9tendue aux ETC (Electronic Toll Collection) ou T\u00e9l\u00e9p\u00e9age et aussi dans une multitude d'autres domaines d'application comme la gestion des flottes, le transport public et la gestion des parkings. Le syst\u00e8me DSRC se compose d'un \u00e9metteur/r\u00e9cepteur (lecteur) et des transpondeurs (badges). En toute logique, l'approche industrielle oriente les d\u00e9veloppements vers la technologie de transpondeur semi passif qui, pour r\u00e9\u00e9mettre un signal utilise le signal transmis par l'\u00e9metteur-r\u00e9cepteur, effectue une modulation de phase d'une sous porteuse fr\u00e9quentielle encodant ainsi les donn\u00e9es \u00e0 transmettre. Cette conception \u00e9vite l'utilisation des oscillateurs locaux, comme dans les transpondeurs actifs, pour g\u00e9n\u00e9rer l'onde Radio Fr\u00e9quence (RF). Ceci permet de produire des transpondeurs relativement \u00e0 faible co\u00fbt et de petite taille. Cependant ce concept n\u00e9cessite quand m\u00eame une batterie au Lithium pour assurer le fonctionnement du transpondeur pour une dur\u00e9e de 4 \u00e0 6 ans et ce malgr\u00e9 les progr\u00e8s des technologies de circuits int\u00e9gr\u00e9s \u00e0 faible consommation. Au fur et \u00e0 mesure de l'expansion de ces \u00e9quipements, il s'av\u00e8re qu'avec les ann\u00e9es la quantit\u00e9 des batteries au lithium \u00e0 d\u00e9truire deviendrait un probl\u00e8me crucial pour l'environnement. Aujourd'hui, la conception d'un transpondeur DSRC compl\u00e8tement autonome n'est pas faisable, car la quantit\u00e9 d'\u00e9nergie n\u00e9cessaire s'av\u00e8re encore \u00e9lev\u00e9e (mode actif 8 mA/3.6 V). N\u00e9anmoins, la r\u00e9duction de la consommation \u00e9lectrique du transpondeur, permet au moins doubler la dur\u00e9e de vie de la batterie et pourrait \u00eatre un bon point de d\u00e9part pour am\u00e9liorer la protection de l'environnement.Dans cette th\u00e8se, nous proposons un nouveau transpondeur DSRC avec un diagramme d'\u00e9tat original qui r\u00e9duit consid\u00e9rablement la consommation \u00e9nerg\u00e9tique. Apr\u00e8s validation d'un nouvel \u00e9tat de fonctionnement en mode tr\u00e8s faible consommation d'\u00e9nergie, nous avons \u00e9tudi\u00e9 la possibilit\u00e9 de recharger la batterie du transpondeur \u00e0 travers de la r\u00e9cup\u00e9ration d'\u00e9nergie sans fil. Le bilan de liaison \u00e9nerg\u00e9tique DSRC a \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9alis\u00e9 afin d'estimer la quantit\u00e9 d'\u00e9nergie disponible quand une voiture avec un transpondeur passe \u00e0 sous un syst\u00e8me de p\u00e9age. Toutefois, le bilan \u00e9nerg\u00e9tique \u00e0 5.8 GHz pr\u00e9sente une faible densit\u00e9 d'\u00e9nergie RF, puisque la voiture ne reste pas assez sur le lobe de l'antenne DSRC afin de proc\u00e9der \u00e0 la r\u00e9cup\u00e9ration d'\u00e9nergie. Par cons\u00e9quent, nous avons alors explor\u00e9 une autre fr\u00e9quence ISM, le 2.45 GHz dans laquelle la pr\u00e9sence d'\u00e9metteurs est bien plus grande. Dans le chapitre de r\u00e9cup\u00e9ration d'\u00e9nergie sans fil nous pr\u00e9sentons la conception et l'optimisation d'un nouveau r\u00e9cup\u00e9rateur d'\u00e9nergie RF.

Context\n\nEngineers are often confronted to improve the system functionality and performances objective while simultaneously maximizing the battery life of electronic devices. From the consumer's viewpoint, they are expecting more and more functionality in a smaller device that operates for a long time, whose battery does not need to be changed often. The common point is the battery; the maintenance cost can be very high and in some cases the replacement is really difficult (e.g.: sensors inside the walls of a house). To effectively design electronic devices with a longer battery life, or even without battery, one should consider the power optimization at all levels, from the circuit architecture up to the application layer. Nowadays, Wireless Sensors (WS) are able to realize three activities, with the associated energy cost, Fig   One first possibility towards maximizing the battery life is by reducing the power consumption. However, we are looking for power reduction not only at an instantaneous time, but over the life of the product. In this case, we introduce the concept of energy, which is the integral of power over a period of time. In general, we may define the total energy consumed by an electronic device as:\n(I-1)\nFor low-power battery-powered applications (e.g.: sensors), the standby mode is predominant and thus its energy requirement impacts directly the battery life. Therefore, before starting the device design, engineers may interrogate themselves on some hypothetical points about the application:\n\n\uf0b7 What is the statechart of the device and how much time is necessary for each operation mode?\n\n\uf0b7 Reduce functional blocks on the RF front-end, decrease the power consumption. Which ones are really necessary?\n\n\uf0b7 When the microcontroller is not running, in a deep-sleep mode, how is its wake-up induced?\n\n\uf0b7 Which is the microelectronic technology that allows the lowest power consumption (or lowest bias current)?\n\nThe answer for these questions may help during the optimization process aiming for energy reduction.\n\nNowadays, most of the low-powered applications need Radio Frequency (RF) transponders for different reasons: a RF link is necessary to the exchange data between Tx and Rx (e.g.: DSRC), the energy necessary to supply the device may be provided by the RF signal (e.g.: RFID)\u2026\n\nIn order to improve the battery life and functionality of the low-powered devices, some approaches may be explored: the optimization of the transponder architecture, the energy required by each electronic component should be efficiently shared and each operation mode should be correctly explored; the process technology choice, since the microcontroller is a primary power consumer, and the way that energy is used should be carefully considered; the RF protocol can be modified (in some cases), saving energy; and finally, new approaches in which is efficiently possible to recharge the battery by means of energy harvesting have been reported.\n\n\nI.1.1. Transponder architecture\n\nWith the purpose of exemplifying transponder architectures, let us consider the case of a classical active transponder, where several electronic components are required to provide a correct reception and transmission of signals, as described in Fig. I-3. In active transponder architecture, the energy is mostly dissipated on the Low Noise Amplifier (LNA), Power Amplifier (PA), Local Oscillator (LO) and microcontroller. Depending on the application, some blocs of the active transponder may be eliminated, e.g., the local oscillator, PA and LNA. Thus, by using a backscattering method, the transponder can recover the incoming carrier to modulate the uplink data stream, and consequently the power is considerably reduced. This architecture is named backscatter transponder, an example of its circuit diagram being described in Fig. I-4. However, the backscatter transponder should be ready to reply the reader's request at anytime, i.e., the transponder should be able to leave the standby mode very quickly. In order to reduce the power consumption of a backscatter transponder, a simple approach may be applied, a supplementary wake-up bloc may be added, creating a supplementary very-low-power mode (deep-sleep). As a result, the transponder is active only when the RF transaction is imminent. Evidently, the protocol and statechart should be modified in order to predict the new operation mode.\n\nOwing to advances in integrated low-power circuit technology, nowadays, completely passive transponders are also available. In most of the cases, the energy required by the transponder is provided by a RF wake-up signal (e.g.: RFID tags). Moreover, an important progress has been done in order to reduce the power consumption of RF transponders, thus a new approach is emerging, i.e., low-power devices may be powered by means of Energy Harvesting.\n\nFurthermore, depending on the application, the transponder architecture may be considerably optimized by reducing the energy consumption. Implementing different operation modes also helps saving energy in a more efficient manner. Nevertheless, to implement a complex statechart, the microcontroller choice should be correctly done.\n\n\nI.1.2. Process technology choice\n\nThe process technology has been improved continuously, and definitely it continues reaching physical limitations. Furthermore, due to the increased demand of faster and smaller, low-power chips, the geometry shrink is an important candidate to manage lowpower, Fig. I-5. Currently, 22/16nm chips are already available, and 11nm are very soon coming.\n\nThe next graph contains a lot of information, if you take the time to parse it, you can observe interesting points, e.g.: the size of the transistor proposed by Xeonis about half of the size of a HIV virus. The semiconductor technology has been improved and leads to lower power consumption, smaller dimensions of transistors, higher packaging density and faster circuits. From a simple sensor to a complex system, they need at least a chip to take the decisions. Despite the advances in semiconductor technology, the chip is still one of the sources of power dissipation in an electronic device. However, this element does not need to be active or running on the maximum clock frequency at all times. Nowadays, several microcontrollers available on the market have at least three operation modes (deep-sleep, stand-by and active) and, as well, the frequency of the clock can be gradually varied. Reducing power consumption in active mode only saves energy if the time required to accomplish the task does not increase too much. We aim at keeping the statechart in the deep-sleep mode as long as possible. Chapter I -Introduction and State-of-the-Art 5 By understanding the potential in the use of the different operation modes, frequency clock control and the many ways of microcontrollers energy consumption, the functionality and battery life of low-power devices may be improved.\n\n\nI.1.3. RF protocol\n\nCommunication applications range from simple RFID transponders to cell phones and cognitive radios or even systems where security enforcement is necessary to guarantee payment transactions (e.g.: DSRC electronic toll collection). Depending on the application, several protocols are available and in some cases the RF protocol can be modified in order to reduce the energy consumption. A good example of a RF protocol evolution is the RFID, in which first the energy necessary to wake-up the tag is sent and then the tag executes the instructions of reception and transmission.\n\nIn indoor applications, Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) appears to be a huge opportunity for protocol development, as energy consumption is a key point for lowpower sensors. We could cite as classical RF protocols for indoor applications: WiFi, Bluetooth and ZigBee. However, recently several companies emerged, providing specific RF protocols optimized for very-low-power or completely autonomous sensors integrating a WSN: enocean, WirelessHart, z-wave, dash7, MyriaNED\u2026 In Fig. I-6, we have a comparison of different indoor RF protocols considering the energy required, as well the indoor range. It should be noticed that if the energy requirements decrease, the battery problem can be easily cancelled out, transforming the devices in battery-less sensors. In outdoor applications, as different RF protocols exist, let us consider as example a particular application, the Electronic Toll Collection (ETC) or e-toll, which employs at least two RF protocols: DSRC and RFID. ETC is based on collecting tolls electronically at toll stations, preventing the traffic jam and providing a faster and safer trip for the drivers. Over the years, for RFID, an important effort has been done in order to transform the RFID tags into completely passive devices. Due to the battery elimination, the fabrication cost was considerably reduced and nowadays for less than $2, RFID tags are sold all over the world. However, in the case not only the ID is required, and writing information on the tag is necessary, depending on the amount of data, using semi-passive tags is unavoidable. In ETC applications, some countries use RFID as RF protocol for the road fee collection. The advantage is the final cost of the system that is really cheap when compared to DSRC protocols, as passive tags can be used and several are the RFID tags and readers available on the market. On the other hand, the RFID protocol does not provide enough complexity levels in order to guarantee a safe electronic payment and consequently can be easily hacked.\n\nDSRC protocol emerged in Europe and it is a complete system designed for vehicle-tovehicle (V2V) and vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) communications. In a V2I communication, this protocol may be deployed for e-toll applications. The advantage of DSRC protocol is the existence of several layers of complexity that guarantee a safe payment transaction. Moreover, DSRC provides a higher data rate than RFID. Due to the amount of data exchanged in a DSRC transaction, the transponder is semi-passive (has a battery). However, industrial European approaches designed the DSRC transponder based on the backscatter method, which uses the same signal sent by the reader to retransmit, perform a frequency shift and encode data to be transmitted. Due to this improvement the DSRC transponder does not need a local oscillator and the energy consumption is considerably reduced. The DSRC protocol is detailed later on in this thesis.\n\nChoosing the RF protocol, if it is possible, is a key point to guarantee the efficiency of the application, by finding a compromise with power consumption. The combination of authorized radiated power (E.R.I.P), data rate and radio sensitivity provides developers with the flexibility to optimize their implementation for range, cost, operating life and ease of installation. In Table I.1, some RF protocols are compared based on EU standards. From the RF link budget, the range can be determined by the sensitivity of the transceiver and its maximum authorized radiated power. In Fig. I-7, several RF protocols are presented by finding a compromise between the power consumption, complexity/cost and data rate.\n\nChapter I -Introduction and State-of-the-Art \n\n\nI.1.4. Potential Energy Harvesting techniques\n\nThe effort over the years in reducing the energy consumption of the transponders, by optimizing the architecture, process technology and RF protocol, is being repaid by an emergent concept, that is, the low-power devices can be powered by means of ambient Energy Harvesting (EH). The energy harvesting concept comes at a time when the \"compromise point\" between energy consumed and harvested may be achieved.\n\nEnergy harvesting may be defined as the conversion process of ambient energy into electrical energy. Radiant (solar, infrared, radiofrequency), thermal, mechanical and biochemical are examples of the ambient energy that surrounds us and thus potential candidates for energy harvesting sources, as described in Fig. I-8. Energy harvesting or scavenging becomes an interesting environmental friendly solution regarding the devices batteries. Even if long-life batteries will still be unavoidable, as technologies mature, energy harvesting is creating some shift in battery usage from primary to rechargeable batteries. However, the biggest potential of energy harvesting is creating a new class of electronic devices that do not need battery, i.e., battery-less, as they are completely powered by ambient sources. Thus, at same time the device cost is clearly reduced and an alternative is provided for the battery discarding problem.  For each industrial application, there is an optimal energy(-ies) harvesting technology(-ies) to be used. Therefore, there will be no \"one size fits all\" solution for all applications. The choice of the energy source may be done on different criteria, e.g.:\n\n\uf0b7 How much energy should be provided for the device?\n\n\uf0b7 Is it for an indoor or outdoor application?\n\n\uf0b7 The powered device should just acquire data and store it or it should send the information by wireless link?\n\n\uf0b7 What is the statechart of the device? How much time is it active and in standby mode?\n\nIn order to understand what is the useful amount of harvested power, and therefore what level of energy could be harvested depending on the energy source and hence how the battery run time works for different classes of electronics, Fig. I-9 gives a description of these different points. In Fig. I-9, we describe that depending on the application, a specific(s) energy harvesting source(s) is/are more appropriate than another one. The comparison of the different ambient energy sources is presented as a function of the available power density for each source, i.e., how much power density is available before conversion into electric energy, based on conversion efficiency. Providing a comparison of different energy harvesting sources implies a normalization of the power density units (\u00b5W/cm 2 or \u00b5W/cm 3 ).This normalization is sometimes forgotten in the literature, and this issue will be discussed later on in this chapter. From Fig. I-9, an interesting point may be observed; the energy harvesting comes at a time when the electric power consumption of the modern devices is being reduced, i.e., the \"compromise point\" between energy consumed and harvested may be achieved.\n\nFrom Fig. I-9, the outdoor sun is clearly the most powerful source in terms of power density available, however, the conversion efficiency is an important factor and solar panels still present low values. Moreover, solar energy is available just a few times during a day ~12h, if it is a sunny day on the Equatorial line. Thermal energy needs a high constant temperature gradient to provide correct conversion efficiency. Vibration energy needs a specific and constant vibration frequency to have good conversion efficiency. Finally, among all the energy sources, RF comes as an interesting candidate to provide energy to low-power electronic devices, since the system can operate 24h a day and high conversion efficiency values can be achieved.\n\nGiven that, in the next section we describe each energy source, presenting some conversion efficiencies reported in the literature and we attempt to convince that Wireless Energy Harvesting could be an interesting candidate as an energy harvesting source.\n\n\nI.1.4.1. Solar\n\nA photovoltaic system generates electricity by converting light into electricity. Solar energy is one of the most powerful sources, however, it is highly dependent on the weather conditions and the conversion efficiency is still low. Some studies estimate that on the earth we have a solar power density of 1000W/m 2 [1] , or 100mW/cm 2 [2]. The amount of harvested power depends on the incident angle of the light, the intensity and spectral content of the light falling on the surface of the solar cell, the size, sensitivity, temperature and type of solar cells used. Therefore, the amount of the solar power density varies with the localization over the earth. A good guideline about how to fix the solar panel, at a given latitude, is reported in [3].\n\nIn general solar cell conversion efficiency is not high. In 1883, the first cell that has photoconductive properties was conceived, by Charles Fritts, and had only 1% of conversion efficiency. Nowadays, the efficiency of the commercial solar cells ranges from a low of approximately 8% to State-of-Art values of 20%, with some experimental technologies reaching as high as 35% [4]- [5]. However, some research groups presented electronic devices successfully powered by solar panels: in [6]- [7] a solar charger designed for small devices (e.g., MP3) was presented and, a fully autonomous sensor node (Heliomote) was produced by ATLA Labs [8]. Despite the classical calculators which have been powered by solar energy since 1970s, nowadays, other commercial products are available: keyboards, toys, radio/watches [9]- [10].\n\nRegarding indoor applications powered by solar panels, we can expect from an indoor solar cell (active area of 9cm 2 , volume of 2.88cm 3 ): \u223c300 W from a continuous light intensity of 1000lx [11], thus we can estimate that for ~12h of sun, a power of 3.6mW.h is recovered.\n\n\nI.1.4.2. Thermoelectric\n\nThermoelectric energy harvesters, based on the Seebeck effect in semiconductor junctions, are used to convert a temperature gradient into electrical power. Briefly, the thermal harvesting is based on a thermocouple placed between a hot and a cold junction, and when the two junctions are subject to different temperatures, heated electrons flow toward the cooler one. If the pair is connected through an electrical circuit, direct current (DC) flows through that circuit, this phenomenon being known as the Seebeck voltage.\n\nSeveral commercial thermal generators are available on the market, in Fig  Volkswagen presented recently an interesting large-scale thermal harvesting solution. Basically, a thermoelectric generator has been conceived for recovering energy dissipated as heat from their vehicles. According to them, the generator is able to obtain about 600W (30% of the car's total electrical consumption), which implies a 5% saving of the fuel consumption [12].\n\nIn the literature, interesting thermal generators were reported: in [13], a thermal generator that harvesters energy from the room temperature, and provides 250\u00b5W from 20\u00b5W/cm 2 , unfortunately the temperature gradient is not provided; in [14], from a 20K of temperature gradient, the thermal generator can provide 20\u00b5W and in [15], from 10K of delta temperature, a power density of 15\u00b5W/cm 2 is converted. In [16], a thermal generator for wireless sensor node applications is presented, 150mW being provided from 34\u00b0C of temperature gradient.\n\nRegarding the thermal/electrical conversion efficiency, which is based on the Carnot efficiency in general, it is low for small to modest temperature differences. For a temperature gradient of 10\u00b0C, the Carnot efficiency would be only 3%. Furthermore, if the gradient temperature is increased, better conversion efficiency is expected, e.g., 100\u00b0C of gradient temperature may provide a 20% of conversion efficiency. However, most of the currently available optimal thermal generators operate below 40%, as reported in [17].\n\n\nI.1.4.3. Mechanical\n\nFrom the rumble of a passing truck, a vehicle engines turning, floors (night club, train stations) or even the human body (heartbeat, walking \u2026), vibrations are an important source of energy surrounding us in our every-day life. There are many opportunities for converting vibrations into electrical power. The amount of electrical energy that can be harvested from mechanical vibration depends on the vibration level, the frequency of vibration and the type, and size, of the harvester.\n\nThe mechanical energy harvesting relies on one of the following three transduction mechanisms [18]- [19]: electromagnetic (EM), electrostatic or piezoelectric. Electromagnetic method [20]- [24], sometimes called electromechanical, is based on the induction principle, that is, a conductor moving through a magnetic flux, an example of such apparatus being presented in Fig. I-11(a). Electrostatic transduction [25]- [29] is based on the movement between two isolated charged capacitor plates to generate energy, an example of this mechanism being presented in Fig. I-11(b). Finally, piezoelectric generators [30]- [33] are based on the mechanical stress applied on a piezoelectric material producing energy, the method being described in Fig. I-11(c).  [20], (b) Electrostatic converter [18] and (c) piezoelectric converter [34].\n\nIn [35], a piezoelectric application was demonstrated, where the vibration generator was able to provide 1.53mW and 1.95mW, from a random vibration from 80 to 115 Hz applied to the device. In [36], an electromagnetic micro-generator was presented, and a theoretical output power of 40\u00b5W/cm 3 was predicted for a frequency of 70Hz. In [37], a different approach for mechanical energy harvesting was presented, where a lasermicromachined springs converting mechanical vibration energy into electric power and the output power density was about 830 W/cm 3 for a frequency resonance of 60-100Hz.\n\nRecently, in IMEP-LAHC laboratory, the piezoelectric nanowires have been studied and designed, as active transducer element for sensors and mechanical energy harvesters [38]- [40].\n\n\nI.1.4.4. Radio frequency (RF)\n\nThe first wireless power transmission (WPT) using the electromagnetic radiation method can be dated back to many years ago when Nikola Tesla conducted his first successful experiment [41]. His experiment consisted in creating an electromagnetic wave with a conductor excited by an oscillator joined to it, as shown in Fig. I-12. Then different receiver circuit topologies, a, b, c and d comprising inductance and/or capacitance were capable to recovery the Radio Frequency (RF) energy. For several years, the wireless power transfer was employed for specific high-power applications; e.g., in 1964, a miniature helicopter propelled by microwave power had been demonstrate [42], other application was the high-power beaming using microwaves for the transmission of energy from orbiting solar power satellites to Earth [43]- [44], as well in the opposite direction which a spacecraft leaving in orbit was powered by a high-power beaming from earth [45]. However, in other environments high-power transmissions are not accepted, for example in-door systems, e.g., distributed sensors in complex environments such as aircraft, ships and houses. In this case the radiated power at each frequency will be limited to very low levels. In recent times, another term emerged; we are interested in recovering the ambient RF energy, i.e., we explore the RF energy already existent in the air from different applications (television, radio, GSM, GPS, WIFI, Bluetooth, satellite, radar, etc\u2026). This emergent concept is called Radiofrequency Energy Harvesting or Wireless Energy Harvesting (WEH). The average power from wireless energy harvesting is typically in the microwatt and nanowatt range based on the radio standard limits or the distance from the transmitter. Due to the radiofrequency development and upcoming technologies, our radio spectrum is filled up by different applications. Each of these frequency bands in the radio spectrum has a standard to control and regulate, which dictates how it is used and shared, how to avoid interference, to set protocol for the compatibility of transmitters/receivers and to determine the amount of RF authorized power to be transmitted. The RF power is a determinant criterion to be taken into account in the RF energy harvesting design.\n\nIn a wide wireless communication system, to guarantee the efficiency of the radio link in a broad range site, several base stations and repeaters are need, and as a result the energy density available in the air is increased, certainly under control of the telecommunications regulatory agency. To illustrate the concentration of RF energy around us, Fig. I-13 shows the emplacement of different (GSM, TV and radio) base stations in Grenoble (157k habitants in a 18km 2 surface), the city where this thesis was developed in. As WEH concept is quite new, some confusion in the literature is made on the definition of this notion. Fig. I-14 shows an original approach to classify the energy recovery/transfer method based on the source type and the amount of energy available/applied.  Power Transfer consists in the transport of energy by a dedicated RF high-power source (e.g., microwave power beaming or inductive energy transmission). Differently from the high-power wireless power transfer, the Wireless Energy Harvesting may be able to recover low-power RF energy already existent in our environment (e.g., outdoor temperature sensors powered by TV signals or autonomous sensors in a smart-house powered by WiFi waves). When the receiving antenna is directly combined with the rectifier, this becomes a Rectenna (RECTifier+antENNA). Rectenna is an intersection between WEH and WPT, and it can be deployed for both processes, depending on the power level. In this thesis we focus on the design and understanding of high-efficiency wireless energy harvesters for low-power applications.\n\nIn wireless energy harvester design some requirements should be considered. First of all, the final application should be defined (performance and functionality required); a simple harvester may provide just the RF-DC conversion for instant utilization and it does not need an embedded power management circuitry and a battery. A more complex harvester should provide a RF-DC conversion and also has the power management circuitry embedded to store the energy. In all RF harvesting cases, the harvester must have a high RF-DC efficiency to convert the maximum of the RF energy into usable electric power. It should have a high sensitivity to be able to harvester ultra-low levels of RF energy. If possible, the WEH device should be able to support a wide range of operating conditions such as input power, load resistance and output voltage. For more complex systems an intelligent power management circuitry is necessary to control and optimize the recovered energy and its use. Finally, the WEH device should be compatible with the standard 50\u2126 to facilitate measurements and RF connections.\n\nMost of the sensors which need this wireless power supply are located within structures where battery replacement would be complicated or impossible, e.g., in a manufacturing process where the quantity of sensors is elevated, earthquake sensors installed on the bridges or at difficult access places, temperature sensors installed in a nuclear power plant where the radiation exposure level is high. In the biomedical industry, in-body implants that need a power supply could be privileged by this wireless power transfer or RF harvesting prolonging the life and maintenance of the implant while avoiding the possibility of contamination and instability associated with implanted battery.\n\nFor indoor applications, several sensors are required to equip a smart-house for example; temperature, humidity, surveillance, light control and others. Most of these sensors are located inside walls or above ceilings; consequently, the battery replacement is unsuitable. Indoor ambient can often have low-light conditions that make solar energy harvesting methods unrealizable. Thermal gradient is not easily available in indoors scenarios and vibration is suitable to be the lowest possible. Finally, one solution could be a simple WiFi router that could power these sensors.\n\nWe can divide the Wireless Energy Harvesting applications in three classes, depending of the RF source [46]: \uf0b7 Intentional sources: the amount of power and the period can be controlled and engineered for a specific application. The sources can be programmable to supply energy for the device continuously or intermittently on a scheduled basis and the amount of power can be also controllable. Application examples: WiFi routers, RFID and we can also imagine an evolution in the mobile base stations.\n\n\uf0b7 Anticipated ambient sources: the sources are not controlled, but they are predicted, i.e., the engineers can predict that at a certain place for a certain time a RF density power intensification is available (e.g.: stadium during a match, where most all the supporters have a mobile or bus station or airport and other crowded places). These sources include also known radio, television and mobile base station transmitters.\n\n\uf0b7 Unknown ambient sources: the sources are neither controlled nor predicted.\n\nThe WEH device will act as an \"opportunist\" (e.g. walk-talk, temporally WiFi cloud, police radio).\n\n\nI.1.4.4.1. Why Wireless Energy Harvesting?\n\nEnergy harvesting has therefore attracted much attention from the research community, because of its potential role as a power supply mainly in two applications: low-power wireless sensor networks and low-power electronic systems. In most of the cases, there is an element that is unavoidable in both applications, the antenna. Since, wireless sensors are connected to a remote system and most of the low-power electronic systems need also to be connected to a wireless network (e.g., internet), the wireless channel is unavoidable. As described in detail in Chapter IV, the Wireless Energy Harvesting device is basically composed of an antenna, a diode and a DC load. Therefore, in a wireless sensor the same antenna could be used for the wireless communication and also for the WEH, saving the occupied PCB area. A basic wireless sensor circuit block is described in Fig. I-15 However, the two operational modes, wireless communication and WEH, should not be  activated at the same time, to avoid interference on the protocol signal quality. Moreover, during a day the wireless sensor is required just a few times, and consequently during the \"free\" time, the WEH process could be operational, as described in Fig. I-16. Wireless energy harvesting is quasi-independent of weather conditions or time of day, can power remote systems over distance, 24hours per day and there is no required physical effort to charge the remote device. WEH is a unique technology and remains the most promising for use in consumer-oriented portable electronic devices that can provide power to thousands of wireless sensors. Devices built with this wireless power technology can be sealed, easily embedded within structures, or made mobile, and battery replacement can be (quasi) eliminated. As the quantity of transmitting devices is increased, the ambient RF power levels are also boosted.\n\nWEH is suitable for applications where the other sources (e.g., solar, vibration\u2026) are not available or slightly available, for example, building interiors where the amount of light makes solar energy harvesting methods unreliable and in the case the electronic device is inside the wall or on the roof, where solar harvesting is definitely not appropriate. Implanted medical devices already exist and run with batteries which can be recharged using WEH. However, energy harvesting efforts will be only rewarded if the power consumption of the electronic devices continues to decrease, and, consequently, ambient RF energy harvesting becomes more practical and available in more areas.\n\n\n\uf0b7 From an economic point of view:\n\nFree-battery sensors or with rechargeable battery are an interesting solution to reduce the battery replacement cost or management effort. Fig. I-17 shows how the cost/management effort for wireless sensors with battery powerfully increases with the amount of nodes in a wireless sensor network.   Fig. I-17. Battery replacement cost as a function of the quantity of nodes in a wireless sensor network, [47].\n\nSince the available ambient power density depends on the number of transmitting devices, two promising technologies are at the forefront of Wireless Energy Harvesting sources: GSM and WiFi. In 2012, 87% of the world population (7 billions) had a mobile phone and this number continues to increase, as shown in Fig. I-18. The number of public WiFi access points has been multiplied by 4.5 in the last 5 years (Fig. I-19) and as well some research groups reported that already in some urban environments, one can detect tens of WiFi transmitters from a single location [48].  Definitely, energy harvesting is a hot topic and there are still several technological barriers to be surpassed. The EETimes magazine in 2011 [49], published an interesting article entitled \"EE Times 20 hot technologies for 2012\", where wireless sensor network supplied by energy harvesting was classified as the second hottest technology. Frost & Sullivan has recently released a report detailing \"Top 50 Technologies Reshaping the World\" [50], included among them are Wireless Sensors, Energy Harvesting and Wireless Charging. IDTechEx published a motivating review about the amount of money spent on energy harvesters research, and they predicted that it was more than $0.7B in 2012 , the perspectives for the next years being optimist, e.g., in 2022, the total market for energy harvesting devices would rise to over $5 billion, Fig. I-20. Since we are talking about money, the audacious companies that are launching the electronic devices powered by means of WEH, have all interest to preserve the intellectual property of their new products. However, since the WEH topic is quite fresh subject, the number of patent applications is still small and first application dated back only few years ago (2004). In Fig. I-21, we have the number of worldwide patent application per year requesting the intellectual property for WEH apparatus. From 2004 to 2014, only 49 worldwide patent applications were provided, it is clear that there is still a lot of work to do in this field. The patent data were acquired from the EPO (European Patent Office) database with the keyword RF energy harvesting.   In the literature, quite a few papers presented high-efficiency rectifiers results for lowpower RF input power, but hardly any elucidate in detail how to achieve high efficiencies levels with a single diode and a simple load. For example, [52] clarified the key components of a harvesting system: (a) miniaturized antenna and (b) high-efficiency rectifying circuit. They proposed a novel, compact and efficient design that can harvest very low-level ambient energy (WiFi band). According to this paper, the proposed rectifier has better conversion efficiency than any power harvester on the market (2012). The harvester can provide 1V for -5dBm input level (10k\u2126 load), and we can deduce the RF-DC efficiency of 31% for this optimal RF input power. Reference [53] successfully developed a RF energy harvester embedded in a low-power transceiver (TRx) front-end, using the same antenna (at 2.4GHz). This prototype has been co-integrated with the lowpower TRx in a 130nm CMOS process and achieves a measured peak power conversion efficiency of 15.9% for 0dBm input power. Recently, in [54], a novel rectenna architecture tunable for 900MHz -2.45GHz operation was presented, its RF-DC conversion efficiency peak is 80% for 25dBm input power. However, for 0dBm input power they achieve only 10% of RF-DC efficiency.\n\nReference [55] reports a four-band circularly polarized antenna for energy harvesting from ambient sources, designed by exploiting genetic algorithm optimization tools. Special remarks go to the antenna design, as the genetic algorithm was applied and for the broadband matching network. However, a double diode circuit was used and the rectenna provides a 10% of RF-DC conversion efficiency for a -13dBm RF input power (at 2.45GHz). In [56], a rectenna at 2.45GHz which has 44% RF-DC conversion efficiency for a 25\u00b5W/cm 2 power density was presented. According to authors, the reported RF-DC efficiency is the highest demonstrated for these power levels (2012). A source-pull method was applied in order to vary the DC load over incident RF power level, to predict the best DC load value. The impedance matching between the antenna and the rectifier was successful, however on the load side the RF impedance analysis was not done, and just the DC aspect was detailed. Differently from the precedent paper, in [57], a higher RF-DC conversion efficiency was reported in the 2.45GHz band for a low RF input signal, 50% of efficiency for a -17.2dBm (0.22\u00b5W/cm 2 ) RF input power. Although the results seem to be hardly achievable in a farfield context, measurements and simulation results are in good agreement as reported in the paper. Special remark goes to the highgain compact antenna design, which was directly matched to the rectifier, through a coplanar stripline (CPS) technology. Due to the CPS method applied, the rectenna benefits on both sinusoidal wave cycles (positive and negative). As the rectenna is fed by CPS, an interesting double-stub tuning matching circuit was designed to transform the CPS to a 50\u03a9 microstrip in order to allow the antenna measurements. In [58], an interesting 2.45GHz rectenna using a compact dual circularly polarized (DCP) patch antenna was presented. The aperture-coupled feed method was used to excite the antenna through two ports phase shifted of 90\u00b0, providing a circular polarization. The rectenna was optimized for 10dBm RF input power, therefore a specific DC load was obtained. The rectenna provides 63% of RF-DC conversion efficiency for an estimated 0.525mW/cm 2 of RF density power. In [59], the 42% efficiency is measured as the ratio of the dc power and the estimated input power to the diode of 0.1mW (-10dBm). The antenna consists in a square aperture coupled patch antenna with a cross shaped slot etched on its surface that permits a patch side reduction of 32.5%. Furthermore, for a low estimated RF input power of -20dBm, the rectenna still provide 16% of efficiency. Reference [60] reports a 52% RF-DC conversion efficiency for an estimated +10dBm (150\u00b5W/cm2) incident power on a four-diode rectifier. The rectifier is integrated with the antenna on the same substrate, and the overall device is compact. However, a modified bridge rectifier with four diodes was applied.\n\nReference [61] reports a rectifier with two diodes. The optimal RF-DC conversion efficiency was 60% for 10dBm RF input power. In [62], an interesting highly-efficient rectenna is presented. The rectenna is based on a multilayer substrate, which the antenna and rectifier are separated. Matching network in the diode input was designed, as well high-order harmonics issue was analyzed. The rectenna presented an efficiency of 34% for an estimated input power of -10dBm (17\u00b5W/cm 2 ). However, a good didactic method is applied on the paper. In [63], a monolithic rectifier was designed with 45% of RF-DC conversion efficiency for a +10dBm RF input power. In [64], the focus was on present analytical models and closed-form analytical expressions in order to facilitate the rectenna design. Even, an important effort was deployed in the mathematical approach, however, the rectenna layout was not precisely described. Nevertheless, an efficiency of 40% was predicted for a high and estimated RF input power of +20dBm. In [65], a dual-frequency printed dipole rectenna has been developed for the wireless power transmission at 2.45 and 5.8 GHz. The rectenna design is based on the CPS method, which allows a size reduction of the antenna. An interesting filter co-design was described, blocking the high-order harmonics for both frequencies. The rectenna is compact and original, presenting a high RF-DC efficiency of 84%, but for a high estimated RF input power of +19.5dBm. In [66], through a Harmonic Balance simulation the diode impedance was optimized at the fundamental frequency (2.45GHz) for a specific RF input power (0dBm). The efficiency was calculated by estimating the receiver antenna gain from the simulation results, and then the estimated received power was predicted. The rectenna presents a RF-DC efficiency of 62% for an estimated RF input of 0dBm. Finally, in [67], a 48-element dipole array was designed with a single diode, allowing high input power values at the rectifier input, therefore a 50% efficiency was measured for a +13dBm RF input power.\n\nNonetheless, to the best of our knowledge, in the literature just a few papers ( [56] and [57]) present a precise rectenna measurement, i.e., since the RF-DC conversion efficiency depends on the RF input power, and consequently, for each output voltage measured, the RF input power value should also be measured. In general, most of the papers estimate the RF input power by subtracting the theoretical free-space path loss from the receiver antenna gain. Further in Chapter IV (IV.5.2), we discuss more in detail this.\n\nAdditionally to the research results obtained by several groups, recently, numerous companies brought up different products using wireless energy harvesting: Intel has created a WEH device that can recover energy from the TV frequency band (674 and 680 MHz), using a UHF log periodic antenna with 5dB gain connected to a 4 stage charge pump power harvesting circuit [46]. An output voltage of 0.7V was measured across an 8k\u2126 load that was enough to power up a thermometer/hygrometer and its LCD display, which is usually powered by a 1.5 Volt AAA battery (no information was given about the RF-DC efficiency). Nokia has started using the energy harvesting technology in a prototype mobile phone that recharges itself using only ambient radio waves (GSM, TV, etc\u2026) [68].\n\nFinally, by investigating the Wireless Energy Harvesting literature, it is important to note that due to the multiple efficiency definitions and different prototype technologies existent in the literature, it is quite difficult to compare the efficiency numbers directly. Another critical point is the normalization of the RF-DC conversion efficiency as a function of received power or power density. Nevertheless, the results described and compared in this thesis were extracted exactly as they are reported in the respective papers. Given that, in the conclusion of Chapter IV, we have summarized the different RF-DC conversion efficiencies reported in the literature of 2.45GHz rectennas designed for Wireless Energy Harvesting, and we have compared to the results obtained in this thesis.\n\n\nI.2. Problem statement: is it possible to design a completely autonomous DSRC transponder?\n\nTo increase the efficiency and safety of the road traffic, new concepts and technologies have been developed in Europe since 1992 for RTTT applications (Road Traffic & Transport Telematics). These applications use the Dedicated Short Range Communications (DSRC) devices at 5.8GHz (ISM band). The DSRC system consists in a reader or roadside equipment (RSE) and a transponder or on-board unit (OBU).\n\nIndustrial European approaches are oriented to semi-passive transponder technology, which uses the same signal sent by the reader to retransmit, performing a frequency shift and encoding the data to be transmitted. This design avoids the use of the local oscillators to generate the RF waves, as in active transponders and save electrical energy of batteries. This allows the development of relatively low cost and small size transponders. Despite advances of integrated low-power circuit technology, this concept still requires a lithium battery to operate the transponder for a period of 4-6 years. However, if this time life seems long, it is not enough and generates important costs for tag providers to replace customers OBU. Moreover, with the expansion of these mobile facilities, it appears that over the years the amount of lithium to destroy has become a crucial problem for the environment.\n\nIn this thesis, the initial objective was to conceive a new low-power DSRC transponder powered by means of Wireless Energy Harvesting at the 5.8GHz band. Since in the DSRC protocol, we have already 5.8GHz energy available, we could imagine that during the time that DSRC OBU is in the sleep mode, we could foresee to recharge the battery of the transponder by means of WEH, as illustrated in the circuit block diagram in Fig. I-16. However, during the thesis development, three major points were detected. First, the priority is to establish the DSRC transaction and as in most of the DSRC applications (e.g., Free-flow), the exposure time of the vehicle in the antenna field is short. This obliged to establish at the same time the DSRC protocol and the WEH at 5.8GHz. Therefore, we are not sure that DSRC protocol and WEH could be active at the same time without interferences on the protocol signal quality. Second, from the DSRC V2I link budget modeling results that are described in Chapter II, we observed that RF link budget at 5.8GHz presents a low power density for the OBU, since the car does not remain enough in the DSRC antenna's field to proceed to energy harvesting, as well as the free-space path loss is high at this frequency and the car's windshield attenuation is important. Third, the electric power consumption of the DSRC OBU is still high when compared to the amount of the energy that could be harvested (Chapter II).\n\nFinally, we have decided to first optimize the energy consumption of the DSRC OBU by means of a new operation mode and then we have explored another ISM frequency for WEH. We chose the 2.45GHz band, because first of all is a license-free band (ISM) that can be deployed in different applications. Second, this is one of the most used frequencies for WEH, and consequently allows us to easily compare our results to the State-of-the-Art. Finally, the free-space path loss at 2.45GHz band is lower compared to 5.8GHz. \n\n\nI.3. Thesis overview\n\nThe manuscript of this thesis will be organized as follows:\n\n\uf0b7 Chapter II (Low power DSRC transponder) focuses on the DSRC e-toll collection application, and particularly on the design of a new low-power DSRC transponder. The chapter will review the DSRC system. Then, the DSRC V2I link budget modeling will be presented. Further on, we will describe the design of the DSRC transponder with an original operation mode that considerably reduces the power consumption. Finally, we will conclude this chapter, presenting the electric power consumption of the new DSRC transponder.\n\n\uf0b7 Chapter III (Antenna design) will present all the antennas developed in this thesis, DSRC and Wireless Energy Harvesting included.\n\n\uf0b7 Chapter IV (Wireless Energy Harvesting) will present an original rectifier/rectenna design method based on the analysis of the optimal load impedance (RF and DC), improving the RF-DC conversion efficiency.

Finally, the results obtained in this thesis will be compared to the Wireless Energy Harvesting State-of-the-Art.\n\n\uf0b7 Chapter V will summarize the conclusions drawn from the current work and will present perspectives and future improvements.\n\n\nII.1. Introduction\n\nIn this chapter we focus on the DSRC (Dedicated Short Range Communication) toll collection application, particularly on the design of a new low-power DSRC transponder. We propose a DSRC transponder with an original statechart that considerably reduces the power consumption compared to the existent transponders on the current market.\n\nFirst of all, the DSRC system is introduced in II.2. A literature overview is presented in II.2.1, showing the different results reported on the Road-Side-Equipment and On-Board-Unit design. Then a DSRC Toll Collection RF link budget was carried out in order to determine the optimum configuration to improve the RF link, as described in II.2.2. Since the electric power consumption of the transponders available on the market is not public-access, we have implemented a measurement setup to estimate the amount of energy needed by these market transponders (2011), the measurement results being presented in II.3.1. Following the electric power consumption measurements, we start the low-power DSRC transponder design with the RF implementation (II.3.2). The microcontroller choice is explained in II.3.3. The low-power DSRC transponder proposed is based on a creative deep-sleep mode, which reduces considerably the power consumption, this new operation mode being detailed in II.3.4. Finally, in II.4 we conclude the low-power DSRC transponder design, and we discuss the feasibility of recharging the battery of the transponder by means of Wireless Energy Harvesting.\n\n\nII.2. DSRC system\n\nDSRC is a wireless technology for automotive use, either among vehicles (V2V) or between vehicles and infrastructures (V2I), supporting public and private safety operations [69]. DSRC is part of a more complex system, ITS -Intelligent Transport Systems, which include telematics and all types of automotive communications. However, ITS are not restricted to road transport; they also cover for the use of Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) for rail, water and air transport, including navigation systems. Some examples of different ITS are presented in Fig. II-1. Many potential applications for DSRC public safety and traffic management exist such as free-barrier toll system (Free-Flow), automatic-barrier toll system (Stop&Go), intersection collision avoidance, approach a vehicle emergency alert, vehicle safety inspection, transit priority signal or emergency vehicle, electronic parking payment, customs clearance of vehicles and safety inspections, signing of vehicles, warning rolling, sensor data collection, highway-rail intersection warning. Among the ITS applications, and particularly the DSRC systems, the e-toll collection has become an interesting solution for highways toll payments, avoiding traffic jam and providing a fast and safe trip for the drivers. In fact, the idea of electronic tolling using microwave signals dates from some decades ago. In 1959, the Nobel Economics Prize winner, William Vickrey, has been the first to propose a system of electronic tolling for the Washington metropolitan area. He suggested that each car be equipped with a transponder. \"The transponder's personalized signal would be picked up when the car passed through an intersection, and then relayed to a central computer which would calculate the charge according to the intersection and the time of day and add it to the car's bill\" [70]. With this new idea, Vickrey demonstrated an important reduction of traffic congestion at the toll plazas by allowing more vehicles per hour/per lane. Naturally, when Vickrey proposed this idea, it was not well received by the traffic control organisms. Nevertheless, he introduces an interesting argument\u03bc \"People see it as a tax increase, which I think is a gut reaction. When motorists' time is considered, it's really a savings\".\n\nThe world's pioneer in the widespread implementation of this technology was Norway, in 1986. Nowadays, DSRC for e-toll collection has standards well established in Europe and also in other countries such USA, Japan, Korea and Brazil. In October 1999, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) allocated to the United States a 75MHz spectrum in the 5.9GHz band for DSRC to be used by intelligent systems in the transport. Similarly, in Europe, the European Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI) has allocated 30MHz of spectrum in the 5.8GHz band for ITS, in August 2008. The decision to use frequencies in the range of 5GHz is due to spectral environment and propagation characteristics, which are adapted to environments of vehicles. The waves propagating in this spectrum can provide broadband communications over long distances, if one has good weather.\n\nThe DSRC architecture has been developed according to the standards included in: EN 12253 (physical layer) [71], EN 12795 (data link layer) [72], EN 12834 (application layer) [73], EN 13372 (communications profiles) [74] and EN ISO/ETSI 14906 (interface for EFC) [75]. For the work developed in this thesis, the EN 12253 standard is indispensable, since it describes the physical layer using microwaves at 5.8 GHz as applicable in the field of Road Transport and Traffic Telematics and the requirements for the short-medium range communication to be used for exchanges between the infrastructure and the vehicle.\n\nA DSRC e-toll system comprises an On Board Unit (OBU), placed inside the vehicle (windshield) and a fixed unit Road Side Equipment (RSE) placed in a fixed spot of the road, enabling the establishment of RF link between vehicles and infrastructure. For RTTT (Road Traffic & Transport Telematics) applications to be efficient, a high percentage of vehicles must detain an OBU. For OBU perspective, the transponder has to be unobtrusive and cannot impact the vehicle design or its safety. For RSE context, the antenna (reader) must be cost-effective and reliable in all environments. Finally, from the company point of view, for after-market purchase, the antenna and electronics must be easy to install and provide excellent value.\n\nNext, we will introduce two well-known configurations of DSRC e-toll collection.\n\n\n\uf0b7 Stop&Go configuration:\n\nStop&Go DSRC e-toll collection is characterized by special lanes in a toll plaza where only drivers equipped with a transponder can have access, as shown in Fig. II-2. The vehicle should approach the barrier with a maximum speed of 30km/h, the wireless identification is done automatically between the RSE and OBU, and then, if the transaction is confirmed, the barrier is opened. Typically, these automatic systems are installed in toll plazas where they coexist with the classical toll booths (payment in cash), since the latter is required for the occasional users who do not have a DSRC OBU. The etoll stations are also equipped with video/image capturing equipment for full-time violation enforcement. In the Free-Flow configuration, there is no barrier, no toll booths and no cash lanes, as shown in Fig. II-3(a). Motorists, instead, experience driving on an open (multi lanes) highway with tolls automatically calculated as they drive through an e-tolling point. The only condition is that the vehicles need to have an OBU inside. The users are able to pass through the toll plazas without slowing-down to pay the highway toll. This system reduces significantly the congestion in highway toll plazas, but on the other hand, the toll operator needs to invest more money in order to avoid no-payment by violators (camera, magnetic loops, etc), as shown in  As observed in Fig. II-3(b), Free-Flow e-toll stations need a metallic platform in order to mount the DSRC vehicle detection devices (RSE, cameras, laser\u2026). However, recently an innovative DSRC Free-Flow toll collection system was proposed in [76]. The antenna reader is buried under the surface of the highway, and consequently there is no visible structure, providing the driver with a more enjoyable trip without visual pollution caused by the toll systems. This original concept is already protected by a worldwide patent application.\n\n\uf0b7 DSRC specifications:   In an e-toll collection scenario, the DSRC reader sends continuously (each 8ms) a BST (Beacon Service Table) signal waiting for a transponder response. The transponder is generally in the sleep-mode, in order to save energy. When a vehicle with a DSRC transponder enters into the e-toll communication zone ( ), as shown in Fig. II-4, the transponder wakes-up and a communication link is opened. In fact, the BST signal is ASK modulated data, that when recognized by the transponder, changes the operation mode from sleep-mode to downlink mode. The different operation modes of a classical DSRC transponder are described in the statechart in Fig. II-5. Due to the fact that only relatively short distances between the RSE and the OBU have to be covered, very cost-effective semi-passive transponder technology can be used. The signal received from the RSE is used for uplink transmission by retransmitting it after a frequency shift and encoding uplink data. This avoids the usage of local oscillators as in active transceivers and allows to easily design battery powered OBU. During the downlink mode, the OBU receives the ASK-modulated data from the RSE. The demodulation part in the OBU is mainly an envelope detector, as shown in Fig. II-6. The amplitude detection is implemented by means of a Schottky diode that makes a direct conversion from the 5.8GHz ASK modulated carrier to baseband; then this signal is sent to the microcontroller. In the uplink mode, the OBU receives an \"unmodulated\" carrier from the beacon.\n\n\nA B Km/h\n\nThen, by applying the backscattering method, the OBU uses this carrier to modulate a subcarrier at 1.5MHz or 2.0MHz which itself is phase modulated with the uplink data stream (250kbit/s). By this type of modulation, two-side bands appear, each containing the same information, as shown in Fig. II-7. After transmission back to the beacon, this signal is converted to the baseband and demodulated. The European DSRC standard established that the OBU should be fully reflective, i.e., the tag does not generate any local frequency. Through downlink process, the Rx-data is detected (envelope) and then processed by the microcontroller. For the uplink mode, the OBU continuously receives the unmodulated carrier signal from the RSE; this signal is mixed with the Tx-data already modulated with the sub-carrier signal and finally sent back to the RSE.\n\nThe circuit block diagram in Fig. II-8 contains two separated antennas, one for transmission and other for reception. The DSRC transponder proposed in this thesis has only one antenna for both operation modes, and will be described later. \n\n\nII.2.1. Literature overview\n\nDSRC has broad applicability due to the numerous possible applications that this system may support. However, its initial development did not have a unique standardization. Consequently, nowadays, three different DSRC standards are used: for the USA, Europe and Japan (Asia). In Table II.3, the different DSRC standards are presented, showing the distinctive specifications for each protocol. Even if Europe and Japan DSRC standards have the same operation frequency, they are completely different, starting with the fact the OBU in the Asia standard is active (local oscillator), whereas in the EU the OBUs are completely reflexive. target applications (i.e., V2I or V2V). In the literature, most of the reported results are in regard to the DSRC vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communications [78]- [86], since this application is widely requested by different cars manufactures companies and definitely, it is broadly deployed for the smart city concept. An important effort has been done in modeling the vehicle-to-vehicle link budget, since one of the major V2V application is the collision avoidance [87]- [89], and consequently there is no place for prediction error. A common issue of V2V and V2I applications is the multipath interference, especially in a critical case, e.g., inside a tunnel. A wide range of studies addressing the radio channel inside tunnel, both theoretically and experimentally, are available [90]- [93]. Research on narrowband radio propagation inside a tunnel, that focus on signal attenuation and fading characteristics are provided in [94]- [95]. Ray-based models are also used to predict the field pattern inside tunnels for both polarizations [96]- [98].\n\nRegarding the vehicle-to-infrastructure applications, and particularly the Electronic Toll Collection, just a few papers are available in the literature. A good review of the European ETC history is presented in [99]. In [100], an interesting study was reported, analyzing the effectiveness of several vehicle and roadside antenna locations under simulated vertical and horizontal polarization at a frequency of 5.8GHz. They demonstrated that in an ETC scenario many factors can affect the signal level, such as the vehicle and the roadside antenna location, the traffic conditions, the polarization, the windshield effects and the roadway reflections. The DSRC ETC link budget analysis was reported in [101] and [102]. Regarding the commercial aspect of the ETC, in [103], an approach of testing and evaluating DSRC systems is presented, pinpointing that before investing in the installation, the operator has to assess the system functionality, quality and reliability. As detailed in Chapter III, the specifications for the DSRC ETC antennas OBU and RSE are quite rigorous, since they should respect the DSRC physical layer criteria [71]. Some DSRC antennas concepts were reported in the literature: [104]- [107].\n\nLooking forward to the development of future ITS, a recently study for V2V communications was presented in [108]- [109]. The system is based on a multifunctional transceiver that has two operation modes, namely, radar (sensing) mode and radio (communication) mode, which are integrated within a single hardware platform.\n\n\nII.2.2. DSRC V2I link budget\n\nIn many RF applications, a specific period of time is necessary to allow a complete data transfer between Tx and Rx devices. In DSRC toll collection this is not different, however, electronic payment is necessary, so the communication link has to be extremely reliable. Therefore a large quantity of information should be exchanged between RSE and OBU, while the vehicles are rapidly travelling through the communication zone ( ), as shown in Fig. II-4. The strength of the RF link budget depends of the mounting configuration of the RSE and OBU. The mounting angles of RSE and OBU, the RSE height and OBU/RSE antenna radiation pattern should be carefully optimized to improve the DSRC link budget.\n\nIn DSRC V2I systems, the antenna gain of the RSE is higher than that of the OBU and as presented previously the DSRC transponder is a backscatter device, consequently the uplink communication (OBU -> RSE) is weaker than the downlink (RSE -> OBU) communication. Nevertheless, the RF link budget modeling is equivalent for both directions (uplink or downlink). In this thesis we present the modeling of the downlink link budget.\n\nIn the literature, to the best of our knowledge, only few papers explored the DSRC mounting configuration. In [110], a study on the optimal configuration for DSRC system is presented, based on the signal strength threshold. The signal strength is calculated from the radiation pattern of the OBU, the receiving pattern of the RSE and the relative location and direction between the OBU and RSE. In [111], a physical model estimating the reliability of the microwave DSRC link for ETC applications was reported. Finally, in [112] an extension of [110] was reported, but using the infrared frequency (wavelength band 780-950nm) instead of microwave. In general, these papers focus on demonstrating the best DSRC mounting configuration which provides a correct RF link. Therefore, we are interested to analyze this point and also predict the amount of energy recovered by the OBU for the two e-toll cases: Free-Flow and Stop&Go. This analysis will be useful to verify the hypothesis of recharging the OBU battery by means of Wireless Energy Harvesting in the DSRC band. For this reason, in our model, we assumed that the OBU boresight axis (center of the main lobe) has the same direction as the RSE boresight axis, and consequently, the angle is not taken into account in the optimization process. The main lobe of the reader antenna has a beamwidth (in degree). The vector is the RSE antenna boresight axis. The distance between the OBU and RSE, , is variable since the vehicle is moving towards the RSE direction with a speed (in km/h or m/s). The vector indicates the detection zone. Outside this region a successful transaction cannot be guaranteed, even if microwave signals are still available, coming directly from the reader or by reflections. and (in W) are the transmitted and received power, respectively. The signal quality received by the OBU depends on many parameters, which can attenuate or amplify the signal. Based on Friis transmission equation, (II-1) shows the instantaneous power received by the OBU. In (II-1) all the variables are in dB.\n\n(II-1)\n\nThe is the transmitted RF power (measured before the RSE antenna input), and its value is controlled by the DSRC reader in order to respect the maximum authorized E.I.R.P. (+33dBm), as described in [71].\n\nis the RSE antenna gain, which depends on the antenna beamwidth ( ). Therefore, a mathematical model for the antenna main lobe has been included in our DSRC mounting model, which is described later in this section. The antenna beamwidth is also standardized by [71].\n\n, the free-space path loss parameter, is represented as a function of the distance between RSE and OBU. The effect of windshield fading is also considered here;\n\nrepresents this attenuation and, in generally, it is currently modeled as a constant parameter. Its modeling will be described later. Finally, is the OBU antenna gain.\n\nBecause of the height of big trucks, in Europe the RSE mounting height should not be lower than 5.5m above the ground. Consequently, in our modeling framework we assumed that is fixed and equal to 5.5m, but the can vary with of the vehicle model.\n\n\n\uf0b7 RSE radiation pattern model:\n\nTypically, the RSE antenna has a gain of 16dBi. In this thesis, we have designed also the high-gain RSE antenna, and its development is presented in Chapter III (III.3.3.2). Nevertheless, we have not included yet the RSE antenna results, and we have modeled the antenna radiation pattern from a mathematical estimation.\n\nSince the real antenna main lobe does not have an ideal radiation distribution, the energy varies with angular displacement. The radiation module can be simulated by a cosine or sinus function, which has been widely used for infrared sources [113]- [114]. Otherwise, standard mathematical models can be as well applied [115]. We estimated the RSE antenna radiation pattern by a sinus function:  \n(II-2)\n\nII.2.2.1. Windshield fading\n\nPredicting a correct model or estimating a value for the windshield fading is not trivial, since nowadays a large number of vehicle models exist, and each fabricant has its own manufacturing method. In many countries, windshields are made of laminated glass, as required by law. Laminated glass can bend slightly under impact. This quality reduces the risk of injury of the drivers. On the other hand, some athermic heat-reflecting windshields and built-in windshield heaters block the microwave signal reception. In [116], different windshield types from different vehicle manufacturers are presented showing the correct position for the transponder placement. In our laboratory, windshield fading characterization has been prepared. The preliminary measurement scenario consisted in two horn antennas placed on the sides of the windshield. The antennas were connected to a VNA and the transmission S parameters were measured. First, the measurement setup was calibrated without the windshield, then the windshield was inserted between the antennas and the S parameters were acquired. A windshield fading of 3dB at 5.8GHz was obtained. Moreover, other measurement scenarios are under analysis. This preliminary windshield fading results are comparable to the one reported in [100].\n\n\nII.2.2.2. DSRC V2I link budget results\n\nBased on the system configuration presented in Fig. II-9, we have implemented a routine in Matlab to estimate the best mounting configuration for the two DSRC toll collection modes: Free-Flow and Stop&Go.\n\nWe are interested in observing two particular parameters: the instantaneous received power and the amount of energy acquired by the transponder. The instantaneous received power is useful in this chapter to check the limit level of power to establish a RF link communication. This is the level above the communication is guaranteed with a specific error bit ratio. The second parameter we analyze is the total amount of RF energy that a vehicle with a transponder is able to collect when passing through a DSRC antenna area. In fact, the importance of this recovered energy is useful for us to introduce Chapter IV -\"Wireless Energy Harvesting\".\n\nTo establish a correct communication, the minimum received power is -43dBm, as standardized in [71]. Nowadays, the DSRC reader produced by Multitoll can execute a complete DSRC transaction in 50-80ms (equivalent to 2.89m at maximum speed of 130km/h), depending on the transaction complexity. This maximum transaction time is important for the estimation of the required communication distance zone as a function of the vehicle speed. For our DSRC RF link budget we use the performance results yielded by the Multitoll DSRC reader.\n\n\uf0b7 Free-Flow toll configuration:\n\nAs presented in the beginning of this chapter, in a Free-Flow toll configuration no barrier exists, the vehicles move in a multi-lane configuration with a maximum speed of 130km/h (Europe). Since there is no stop or speed reducing and the time needed for a complete transaction is short, the communication zone is narrow. The first mounting configuration to be analyzed is defined by the following parameters:  At a speed of 130km/h we need at least 1.81m to 2.9m as communication zone to complete a simple DSRC transaction (50ms to 80ms). Nevertheless the period necessary to complete a transaction could be higher depending on the transaction complexity and RSE performances. Multitoll requests a minimum detection zone of 10m, based on in-situ tests. From Fig. II-12 a RSE mounting angle of 45\u00b0 provides a sufficient detection zone distance and the received power criterion is respected. As a result, in Fig. II-13 we have confirmed for different OBU heights that the RSE mounting angle of 45\u00b0 provides a correct detection zone distance and enough incident power. In Fig. II-13, a second configuration is analyzed; now the RSE mounting angle is fixed (45\u00b0), but the OBU height vary, since different classes of vehicle are available on the market (e.g. classical cars, sport cars, vans, trucks\u2026). The second mounting configuration is defined by the following parameters:\n\uf0b7 RSE antenna beamwidth: =15\u00b0 \uf0b7 E.I.R.P transmitted RF power: =+33dBm \uf0b7 Windshield fading: =3dB \uf0b7 OBU antenna gain: =7dB \uf0b7 RSE height: =5.5m \uf0b7 OBU height: =1.5m \uf0b7 Vehicle speed: =130km/h (or 36.1m/s) \uf0b7 The RSE\uf0b7 RSE antenna beamwidth: =15\u00b0 \uf0b7 RSE mounting angle (relative to the vertical plane): =45\u00b0 \uf0b7 E.I.R.P transmitted RF power: =+33dBm \uf0b7 Windshield fading: =3dB \uf0b7 OBU antenna gain: =7dB \uf0b7 RSE height: =5.5m \uf0b7 Vehicle speed: =130km/h \uf0b7 OBU height: =variable\nBased on the specifications described before, we choose three OBU heights. A height of 1.5m is representative for a classical car, 1.9m for a van and 2.5m for a truck.  \n\n\nLower power limit for communication\n\nAs expected, the incident power increases with the OBU height. The communication zone distance shrinks, when the OBU height augments. The RSE mounting angle of 45\u00b0 provides a correct detection zone distance and enough incident power for different OBU heights.\n\nWith the received power during the detection zone, it is possible to estimate the DSRC RF energy harvested. This energy is proportional to the surface of the integration bellow:\n(II-3)\nIn Fig  For small RSE mounting angles, the amount of recovered energy increases, but around 45\u00b0 the recovered energy, saturates, as showed in Fig. II-14. A resume of the total DSRC RF energy harvested for Free-flow and Stop&Go configurations is given in Table II.4 and  Table II.5.\n\n\n\uf0b7 Stop&Go toll configuration:\n\nStop&Go configuration resembles to the classical toll plaza, where several lanes are available for the drivers; the only difference is that the automatic lanes are equipped with DSRC systems, and the payment is made automatically as the vehicle approaches. The maximum accepted speed for this configuration is 30km/h (8.33m/s). If the Stop&Go transaction works well, the vehicles should neither stop, nor reduce their speed. The barrier is opened instantly when the transaction is completed.\n\nThe instantaneous received power and communication zone are dependent of DSRC mounting configuration parameters. The vehicle speed impacts directly the recovered energy calculus, since the time the transponder is lighted by the reader antenna field is dependent of the vehicle speed, as described in (II-3). Given that for the Stop&Go In Table II.4 and Table II.5, the estimated recovered energy is presented for both configurations (Stop&Go and Free-Flow). The Free-Flow results in Table II.4 and in  Table II.5 are based on the mounting parameters described in Fig. II-12 and in Fig. II-13, respectively. The Stop&Go results are also based on the mounting parameters previously discussed with a single difference, the vehicle speed. From Table II.4 and Table II.5, we assume that the vehicles neither stop nor reduce their speed on the toll plaza. Consequently, a low-power recovered energy is observed, even for the more favorable case, a truck's driver ( =2.5m) on a Stop&Go toll.\n\nNonetheless, the Stop&Go systems are conceived to avoid that the vehicle stops in the DSRC toll lanes. It happens often, that the vehicle is immobilized for at least 2s due to the transaction delay and anti-violation enforcement (capture video/image). If we take this condition into account, the energy recovered will increase considerably. For instance, a transponder on a truck that stops under the maximum RF power, between 3 and 5 \u00b5W, at position around 1.5m and 2m, during 2s in the communication zone, could harvest 10\u00b5J from the DSRC band. This is the best scenario for the RF energy harvesting in the DSRC band.\n\nIn view of the fact that we have available RF energy in the DSRC band, we could foresee recharging the battery of the DSRC transponder by means of Wireless Energy Harvesting, improving the battery lifetime. Nevertheless, two issues arise: first, the priority is to establish the DSRC transaction, we are not sure that DSRC protocol and RF energy harvesting could coexist in the same band, without interferences on the protocol signal quality. Second, the amount of RF energy available becomes significant only for the Stop&Go configuration (stop time>2s). Therefore this assumption goes in the opposite direction of the DSRC toll collection principle, that is, to reduce traffic jam and time spent in highway tolls.\n\nBased on these DSRC V2I link budget results and in the aim of improving the battery lifetime of a DSRC transponder, we decide to look up for a different method than 5.8GHz\n\nWireless Energy Harvesting. In the next section (0), we present a new low-power DSRC transponder design based on an original operation mode that considerably reduces the power consumption.\n\n\nII.3. A new low-power DSRC transponder design\n\nIn this section we describe the new low-power DSRC transponder design. The DSRC transponder circuit diagram ( Fig. II.15) presented in this thesis is greatly simplified compared to the classical structure proposed in the literature, as shown in Fig. II-8. The DSRC transponder specifications requested by Multitoll are: bi-directional transmission architecture, that is, only one antenna Tx/Rx should be deployed, ultra low standby power consumption, high detection sensitivity for downlink, and completely reflective transponder . \n\n\nII.3.1. Electric power consumption of DSRC transponders on the current market\n\nThe objective of this section is to present an analysis of the electric power consumption of several DSRC transponders existing on the current market (2011). The results obtained on these measurements are used as reference for the low-power DSRC transponder design proposed in this thesis. Three DSRC transponders have been studied, for confidentiality reasons we will name them: T1, T2 and T3. The transponders have a battery and for safety reasons, if this battery is taken off, the memory is deleted. This procedure is important to avoid that toll users try to manipulate the transponders. Voltage battery is equal to 3.6V. Once the measurement setup (II.3.1.1) has been made operational, the DSRC transponder has been excited by a typical DSRC wake-up frame (BST), as described in [121].\n\nTo estimate the electric power consumption, we need to measure the current of the transponder for each operation mode of the device. This procedure should be executed without any voltage fluctuation to avoid erasing the transponder memory. \n\n\nII.3.1.1. Measurement setup\n\nThe purpose of this experiment is to succeed with a single amplifier operating in the inverse mode, to transform measured output voltage into current absorbed by the transponder (\"badge\"). The measurement setup is presented in Fig. II-16. The relation between voltage ( ) and current ( ) is the following:\n(II-4)\nThe operational amplifier (op-amp) used is the TL081-ST. The transponder must be placed in series with the amplifier and above all, must be powered at all the times, to prevent data loss. The choice of the resistance requires a compromise between the gain and the bandwidth of the measurement setup. We expect that the current to be measured is around 10mA. To ensure the non-saturation of the op-amp, the resistor is chosen equal to 1k\uf057. The real value of the resistor Rs is measured and it is equal to \u03bb\u03bb5\u03a9. In Fig. II-17 a picture of the measurement setup is presented.  In a DSRC transponder the maximum bit rate is 500kbp/s with ASK modulation, thus its occupied bandwidth is 1MHz. We have made a simple test in order to verify if the bandwidth of the amplifier circuit is large enough to cover the modulation bandwidth. The setup consisted in injecting a sinusoidal to the inverting input of the op-amp, varying\nBadge Vs +15V -15V 3.6 V\n\nRs\n\nRs the frequency of the sinusoidal, and measuring the output voltage saturation. From voltage measurement results, we could check the operating limit frequency. We have observed that the bandwidth limit is around 3MHz. We could therefore conclude that the proposed measurement setup is correct for our requirements.\n\n\n\uf0b7 Leakage current:\n\nTo ensure the correctness of all measurement results acquired in this section, the existence of a leakage current should be verified. We can check the current at the inverting and non-inverting inputs of the amplifier, with the purpose to confirm if the leakage current is significant. We expect measured results around 10\u00b5A with =995\uf057 and from the amplifier manufacturer datasheet the input impedance of the amplifier is 10 12 \u2126 ( ). Applying a voltage division rule, the current at the inverting input ( ) can be deduced from the following equations:\n(II-5)\nFrom (II-5) we have around 10mV. Consequently we can estimate the inverting current:\n(II-6)\nAs a result, the current at the inverting input is equal to 1x10 -14 A. The current values that we have acquired during our measurement are around 10mA. Then, we have observed that the inverting input current is 10 12 times smaller than the output current. Consequently, we have assumed that the measurement setup is acceptable and the results have been considered.\n\n\nII.3.1.2. Electric power consumption measurements results \uf0b7 Transponder T1:\n\nA high impedance oscilloscope probe has been placed at the output of the amplifier to measure the voltage ( ).\n\n\nStandby mode:\n\nThe average measured value of the voltage, -13mV, has been recovered directly on the screen of the oscilloscope. From (II-4), we have deduced the value of the current corresponding to the standby mode. The current of the transponder T1 on the standby mode is 13\u00b5A.\n\nActive mode:\n\nThe DSRC transponder switches to the active mode when an AM signal is received. In Fig. II-18 we have shown the output voltage measurement of the transponder for the active mode. From the measurement results, we have observed that in the active mode, this transponder has three different periods of operation. However, we do not have more information about this particular operation mode for this transponder. The transponder T1 has an average current consumption equal to 8.2mA and the protocol window has a duration of 6.97ms. Since the battery voltage is equal to 3.6V, the total energy consumed by the transponder T1 in the active mode is about 206\u00b5J.\n\n\n\uf0b7 Transponder T2:\n\nStandby mode:\n\nThe voltage average value is equal to -11mV. From (II-4), we have deduced the current value corresponding to this transponder operation mode. The current of the transponder T2 for the standby mode is 11\u00b5A.\n\nActive mode:\n\nThe average current is equal to 9.6mA. The total energy consumed during 6.97ms, for a voltage equal to 3.6V, is 241\u00b5J.\n\n\n\uf0b7 Transponder T3:\n\nStandby mode:\n\nFor transponder T3, the standby mode measurement results could not be exploited, since the average output voltage value for this mode is positive and from the sketch proposed in Fig. II-16, positive values are not in agreement with the measurement setup.\n\nActive mode:\n\nThe transponder T3 has an average current consumption equal to 5.25mA. The total energy is equal to 132\u00b5J (with a voltage of 3.6V). \n\n\nII.3.1.3. The importance of a low-power operation mode\n\nWe have tested three transponders from the current market (year 2011) in order to estimate their electric power consumption. The measurement results have been resumed in Table II  From Table II.7, we can observe that over a day, the duration of the standby mode is predominant compared to the active mode, even if the transponder is active more than one time per day. We can make an estimation of the number of recalls per day as a function of the user's profile. For example\u03bc \uf0b7 Common driver: 2 times per day.\n\n\uf0b7 Truck's driver\u03bc 6-8 times per day.\n\nEven if we take as example the case in which the transponder is requested 8 times during a day (truck's driver), the energy demanded for the active mode will not be significant compared to the standby mode. The requested amount of electric charge factor is around 390 times between both modes. Since we are interested to improve the battery lifetime of the DSRC transponder, we should focus on the standby mode optimization.\n\nIn the next section, the DSRC transponder design is presented, starting with the RF implementation and then, describing the deep-sleep mode implementation.\n\n\nII.3.2. RF implementation\n\n\nII.3.2.1. DSRC transponder chip evaluation board design\n\nMultitoll required the DSRC chip to be integrated in our transponder should be reliable and large scale production tested. For this reason, we have oriented our research towards a DSRC chip available on the market. Nevertheless, in the literature several papers present interesting results of a fully reflexive DSRC transponder. In [117], a compact ETSI compliant DSRC Transponder is reported, based on a RFIC custom chip with two separated antennas Tx/Rx. In [118], a preliminary study of low-cost transceiver is presented, based on low cost components, however no power consumption information is given. Moreover, an active (but not fully reflexive) DSRC transponder, and more specifically a retrodirective transponder with a local oscillator, is also reported in [119].\n\nWe have acquired a GaAS MMIC transponder dedicated to short range communications at 5.8GHz. This RF module embedded the three classical operation DSRC modes: standby, downlink and uplink. The IC, named CHR2244 [120], is produced by UMS. The objective is to implement and characterize this DSRC transponder chip through an evaluation board. Following these measurement results, we have included this transceiver in our transponder development and then improved the total electric power consumption balance, by implementing a new standby mode. In Fig.  II-19, the IC chip diagram is presented. The selection of each operation mode is made from the control inputs (T/R, WK_in). The RF port can be at a time either reception or emission mode. Two outputs are provided: DATA_out and SB_out; the first output is the demodulated signal and the second output can be used as a flag to inform the microcontroller of the demodulated frame duration. The input MOD is used in the uplink mode, in which the data is modulated with the carrier signal coming from the beacon. This module is driven by a low-power consumption microcontroller.\n\nThe package outline and pin connections have been extracted from the manufacturer datasheet [120]. Then, a RF prototype board circuit has been designed with the minimal external components and no active components in order to save energy. In Fig. II-20 the circuit diagram is presented.\n\n\n46\n\nChapter II -Low-power DSRC transponder In Fig. II-21, the RF prototype board layout is presented. A flat-ribbon connector has been set up to facilitate the microcontroller interface. An impedance matching network has been implemented at the RF input in order to provide a 50\u2126 matching.   After the RF prototype board design and fabrication, we proceed with the chip characterization, detailed in the next sections.\n\n\nII.3.2.2. DSRC transponder chip characterization\n\nThe chip evaluation board has been tested for the three DSRC operation modes. To verify the limits of DSRC IC, a characterization setup has been carried out, observing in particular the transponder response for the following parameters variation: RF input power signal (power limit communication), modulation bit rate and supply voltage.\n\n\n\uf0b7 Standby mode characterization:\n\nIn this mode, an amplitude modulated RF signal is required to produce a DC voltage at the output SB_out which can be used as a flag of the communication beginnig. SB_out output is active if and only if an AM modulated signal RF is applied at the RF input. The standby characterization setup is presented in Fig. II-23.  RF input signal variation: for the four DSRC carries frequencies (5.7975GHz, 5.8025GHz, 5.8075GHz, 5.8125GHz) the RF input signal varies from -50dBm to 0dBm, the modulation bit rate is set to 500kbit/s and the supply voltage to 3.1V. The IC transponder has responded well for all RF powers, i.e., a clear DC signal on the SB_out output has been detected. During the measurements, the standby DC current has been found to be approximately 9\u00b5A. Modulation bit rate variation: for this measurement, the RF input signal level is set to -30dBm (typical DSRC RF input power), the carrier frequency equals 5.8025GHz and the supply voltage is 3.1V. The modulation bit rate has been varied from 31.25kbit/s to 530kbit/s and the IC transponder has reacted well, by presenting a clear DC voltage on the SB_out output. For a bit rate of 100kbit/s, which is not of our interest, the result is not stable.\n\nSupply voltage variation: In order to verify the supply voltage limitation of this IC, we have varied the Vcc from 2.7V to 3.6V and set the RF input signal level to -30dBm. The carrier frequency equals 5.8025GHz and the modulation bit rate 500kbit/s. During this variation, the circuit has worked at all voltages (no problems were detected).  The RF input signal applied this time is a typical DSRC frame, as described in [121]. The frame has been sent continuously during the measurements. Fig. II-26 shows the oscilloscope print screen, where the rose curve is the SB_out signal and the yellow curve is the DATA_out signal. We can observe that both outputs are synchronized. The SB_out confirms the frame begin and end. In Fig. II-27, a zoom on a frame is presented. The yellow curve (DATA_out) shows a wake-up preamble before the frame, and then the flag (rose curve, SB_out) presents a rising edge signaling that the frame starts. At the frame end, since there is no amplitude variation on the data, the flag shows a falling edge. As for the standby mode, a measurement setup has been developed in order to push the IC transponder to its operation limit, by applying the same parameter variation (supply voltage, frequency carrier and bit rate). During the downlink measurements, the IC responded well for the parameter variation, the only difference being that the current consumption evidently increased to 159\u00b5A due to the operation mode changing (standby->downlink).\n\n\n\uf0b7 Uplink mode characterization:\n\nUplink mode relies on a backscattering of the incoming carrier 5.8GHz ( ) multiplied by the modulated data ( ) at the input MOD. In fact, the ETSI standard recommends the modulation to be made around a subcarrier . The uplink signal result is a transposition of the carrier around the sub-carrier ( \u00b1 ), as presented in Fig. II-28. The characterization setup for the uplink mode requires an extra attention, since we need to inject the carrier signal, multiply it with the modulated data and then observe the spectrum to verify if the modulation is corrected. Fig. II-29 shows the characterization setup for the uplink mode. At the MOD input we should provide the subcarrier at 1.5MHz or 2.0MHz which itself is phase modulated with the uplink data stream (250kbit/s). For this reason, we set up a BPSK modulator based on a synchronization of the sub-carrier ( ) and the data ( ) signals in a XOR gate, as described in Fig    The DSRC transponder chip characterization has provided corrected results, and therefore, we have decided to integrate this IC in our DSRC transponder.\n\n\nII.3.3. Microcontroller sleep mode + Demod Bloc (FPGA)\n\nAs presented in previous sections, the DSRC chip has three operation modes: standby, downlink and uplink. In general, the transponder remains in standby mode and only when the vehicle is approaching an e-toll plaza, it switches to the active operation mode. A considerable energy saving could be achieved if we could just turn on the DSRC chip when the car starts to move for example. Given that we need an extra operation mode with very low power consumption and from a wake-up flag, the transponder switches on to the classical standby-by mode.\n\nSince the microcontroller supplies and pilots each bloc of the DSRC transponder, choosing a low power microcontroller with a deep-sleep mode is primordial.\n\nNowadays we can find microcontrollers that provide a deep-sleep mode for very low power consumption. The C8051F91X from Silicom labs provides a deep-sleep mode that consumes 50nA, and an active mode consuming 160\u00b5A/MHz (24.5MHz clock). Recently, Microchip has presented the nanoWatt microcontroller series providing a verylow-power deep-sleep mode. The PIC1XF182X Microchip family achieves sleep currents as low as 20nA, and a run mode current consumption less than 50 A/MHz. Moreover, Microchip has presented the PIC24F16 with deep-sleep mode current down to 20nA and run mode current down to 8\u00b5A. We choose the PIC24F16 from Microchip for our DSRC transponder design.\n\nAlthough the very low-power microcontroller was chosen, during the downlink mode, the DSRC transponder needs to demodulate a 500kbit/s AM signal. Given that a potential DEMOD bloc will be need in order to help the low-power \u00b5C to process the received information. This bloc could be implemented by a FPGA. In this thesis, the DEMOD bloc is not analyzed, but it is included in the transponder diagram.\n\n\nII.3.4. A new deep-sleep mode\n\nTo the best of our knowledge, the DSRC transponders currently available on the market have tree operations mode: standby, downlink and uplink. From the electric power consumption results obtained in section II.3.1, we have observed that during a day the operation mode that consumes more energy is the standby mode. In this thesis we thus propose a new low-power standby mode, i.e., a deep-sleep mode.\n\nDepending on the driver's profile, the vehicle use differs. For instance, highways drivers, often make pauses for rest during the day and, in general, keep their vehicles parked during the night; in a common day-to-day city life, the duration for which the vehicle is parked is bigger. Average number of kilometers per year in France is around 25,000km (about 68.5km/day), so less than 2 hours of use by day and 22 hours of parking. For most DSRC transponders available today, during all this \"parking time\" the DSRC transponder is running in standby mode (13\u00b5A/3.6V).\n\nFor the DSRC transponder proposed in this thesis, while the vehicle is parked, the transponder is in a (very-low-power) deep-sleep mode and only when the motor is turned on, it switches to the standby mode. This wake-up will be induced by a vibration sensor. The new operation mode for the DSRC transponder is presented in Fig. II-33. The vibration sensor chosen for our application is the SQ-MIN-200 produced by Signal Quest [122]. The SQ-MIN-200 is an omnidirectional sensor that acts as a closed switch in the rest state and chatters open/closed when it is tilted or vibrated. Hence, we can define our DSRC transponder by a five bloc structure as presented in Fig. II-34. An additional DEMOD bloc is inserted in our diagram in order to help the microcontroller demodulating a 500kbit/s signal. \n\n\nII.3.4.1. Vibration sensor evaluation board design\n\nIn a simple configuration, the vibration sensor requires only a resistor to limit current, and is fully passive. For our application, a sensitivity control circuit (or lowpass filter) should be employed to reject light vibration/bumps and to provide a proper trigger; an integrating capacitor is used to determine the integration time. Since the wake-up signal from the vibration sensor goes directly to the microcontroller, it is important to keep a minimum voltage amplitude, in order to ensure the wake-up signal is detected by the \u00b5C. Nevertheless, the current consumption of the sensor is proportional to the supply voltage  applied on its terminals. Another important point is that the sensor is sensitive to the mounting position (vertical, horizontal, diagonal \u2026) and the direction of the excitation.\n\nBased on the above specifications a sensor prototype board has been designed and realized in order to test the sensor sensitivity in an in-situ configuration (II.3.4.2). In Fig.  II-36, the circuit diagram of the vibration sensor prototype board is presented. Two sensors have been deployed on two perpendicular directions on the evaluation board. At the circuit input, different series resistor values are added to provide a flexible resistance during the tests. An integrator capacitor of 5nF is used. The simplified circuit diagram is presented in Fig. II-36. Cap_out1 and Cap_out2 are the outputs interface to the \u00b5C. For the sensor prototype board layout an interesting assembly has been achieved. Since the evaluation board is controlled by a microcontroller, during the in-situ tests, it is interesting to reduce the number of the equipments on board (inside the vehicle). From the already available microcontroller board, we have designed the sensor board in order to match the supply voltages pins of the microcontroller board. To yield a better mobility for the assembly, the supply voltage has been provided by a USB port (+5V) from the laptop used during the measurements. Therefore, at the circuit input a zener diode is required in order to assure +1.8V to the microcontroller supply. Three LEDs have been deployed with the purpose to indicate the output information: one for the supply voltage indication and two others for vibration detections (horizontal and vertical vibration sensors).\n\nIn Fig. II-37 \n\n\nII.3.4.2. In-situ deep-sleep tests\n\nThe aim of the in-situ tests is to verify if the vibrations induced by the vehicle movement could be detected by the vibration sensor. We are also interested in verifying how the vibration sensor responds for different vehicle movements/actions (starting the car, closing the door, acceleration \u2026).\n\nThe assembly (vibration sensor prototype board + \u00b5C board) is fixed on the windshield of the vehicle in a specific position , that is, one of the sensors is in a horizontal position relative to the ground and the other one in a vertical position. To check if the vibration sensor responds correctly, different scenarios have been tested, the vibration detection criterion being based on the LED lighting as following:\n\n\uf0b7 OK+: LED lighting was constant, i.e., strong vibration detected.\n\n\uf0b7 OK: LED lighting was shortly observed, i.e., light vibration detected. The measurement results are presented in Table II.8. Both sensors are appropriate and sensible for different scenarios and very precise even when the vehicle has stopped at a traffic light. As expected, the mounting position influences the vibration detection. An interesting scenario to exemplify the importance of the mounting position is when the vehicle is in a curve, since the horizontal sensor responds better than the vertical one, as shows Table II.8. Nevertheless, both (vertical/horizontal) mounting positions have provided satisfactory results. The electric power consumption measurements have been also analyzed, but they are described in the next section with total amount of DSRC transponder power consumption. Since the microcontroller provides the for the others blocs, we have decided to supply the microcontroller with +3.3V and thus +3.1V will be available to the other blocs. The microcontroller chosen for our application is the nanoWatt Microchip PIC, which has a very-low-power current in the deep-sleep mode, [123]. Table II.9 shows the total electric power consumption for the low-power DSRC transponder proposed in this thesis. We can take the example of the city driver, who goes to work and needs to use the highway traversing two DSRC toll plazas. We consider that he needs one hour to go to work and one to come back home and that during the night his vehicle is parked.\n\n\nII.3.5. The energy consumption of the proposed DSRC transponder\n\nFollowing the power electric consumption measurements (Table II.9) and based on the flowchart presented in Fig. II-35, we can estimate the energy required by the DSRC transponder for each operation mode during a day.  With the proposed statechart, it is clear that the current consumption can be considerably reduced, by using to the new deep-sleep mode. Since the deep-sleep needs 48mJ during a day and it is the predominant mode, the total power consumption of the transponder is significantly reduced. In the next section, we compare the power consumption of the DSRC transponder proposed in this thesis with the power consumption of others transponders.\n\n\nII.4. Conclusions\n\nIn this chapter we have presented the proposed new DSRC transponder with an original statechart that considerably reduces the power consumption.\n\nFirst of all, the DSRC system has been introduced and then the RF link budget modeling has been carried out in order to predict the best DSRC mounting configuration. Since we did not have any knowledge about the amount of energy the transponders on the current market consume, we have established our own measurement setup to acquire this information. Based on these measurements, we have designed a low-power DSRC transponder.\n\nThe new DSRC transponder design starts with the DSRC chip characterization, for which an evaluation board has been conceived to assist the measurements. Since the IC measured performance corresponds well to our specifications, we have decided to include the DSRC chip in our transponder design. We have implemented a deep-sleep mode based on a vibration sensor, and a mobile evaluation board supplied by a USB port has been conceived. In-situ tests have been carried out. By implementing the supplementary operational mode, the electric power consumption has been considerably reduced.\n\nComing around the example of the driver described previously, that is, spending two hours per day on the road and keeping its vehicle parked during the night, a comparative table between the classical and the proposed DSRC transponder in this thesis is described in Table II.11. Reminding that classical transponders do not have a deep-sleep mode and that the standby mode is predominant during a day, our approach makes major use of a deep-sleep mode. ). An amount of energy of 10 \u00b5J could be recovered if the driver spends 2s in the RSE antenna field. Nevertheless, even if considering the transponder power consumption proposed in this thesis (314mJ), the recovered energy by means of DSRC Wireless Energy Harvesting would not be enough. Moreover, the request that the vehicle should spend more time in front of the antenna counteracts the DSRC toll collection principle, that is, reducing traffic jams and time spent in highway tolls. Based on this analysis, we have decided to explore the Wireless Energy Harvesting for other than the DSRC 5.8GHz frequency, we chose therefore, the 2.45 GHz that is also included in the ISM band (Chapter IV).\n\n\nChapter III -Antenna design\n\n\nIII.1. Introduction\n\nNowadays antennas gain their place everywhere in environments surrounding us. Television, radio, cell phones, WiFi, garage doors opener, car remote locking central, etc, are just a few examples of applications that require antennas for functioning. Antennas are indispensable for any radio receiver or transmitter to couple its electrical connection to the electromagnetic field.\n\nThe first antenna was built by the German Heinrich Hertz in 1888. He developed a wireless communication system in which an electrical spark was forced to occur in the gap of a dipole antenna [124]. Nevertheless, we could associate the terminology creation, \"antenna\", with the Italian Guglielmo Marconi, in 1895, in the Swiss Alps, he conceived an early radio communication between two long wires that he named \"aerials\". Marconi uses the word antenna that spreads among wireless researchers, and later is adopted by the general public [125]. Antenna or aerial could be defined as \"a means for radiating or receiving radio waves\", in IEEE Standard Definitions of Terms for Antennas [126]. In other words the antenna is an interface between free-space and guiding device, as defined in [127]. A good review about major events in the development of antennas is presented in [128].\n\nIn this chapter, we describe the fundamentals of antennas, basic definitions, highlighting the different field regions around the antenna. Then, in III.3, we present the Multitoll requirements for the antennas design, followed by the detailed explanation of the antennas developed in this thesis: in III.3.3 for DSRC applications and in III.3.4 for Wireless Energy Harvesting.\n\nAs already explained in the introduction of this manuscript, this thesis was realized in collaboration between the IMEP-LAHC laboratory and the Multitoll Solutions SA Company. Consequently some of the antennas have been designed following rigorous specifications from Multitoll, applying to specific practical applications. Nevertheless, an important effort was devoted in order to promote the transfer of knowledge from research to the industry.\n\n\nIII.2. Antenna fundamentals\n\n\nIII.2.1. How an antenna radiates\n\nLet us take the simple case where two conductor wires are connected to an antenna and are excited by a source, as shown in Fig. III-1. Since a voltage is applied across the conductors, an electric field is generated between the conductors. Nevertheless, the radiation occurs if there is a movement of charge, i.e., creation of the current that in turn creates a magnetic field intensity. If there is no motion of charges, no radiation arrises. In order words, due to the time-varying electric and magnetic fields between conductors, the electromagnetic waves travel along the transmission lines and when approaching open space, the radiation occurs, as shown in Fig. III-1(b).\n\nIf we assume the voltage source is sinusoidal, electromagnetic waves are created continuously with a period equal to that of the applied source, and these waves travel along the transmission line, throughout the antenna and are radiated into free space. Inside the transmission line and the antenna, the electromagnetic waves are sustained due to the charges, but as soon as they enter the space, they form closed loops and are radiated as described in [127]. The two-wire conductor is one example of antennas. It is useful to explain the electric and magnetic field variation that generate the radiation.\n\n\nIII.2.2. Fundamental parameters of Antennas\n\n\nIII.2.2.1. Radiation pattern (farfield)\n\nThe antenna radiation pattern is defined by IEEE standard as \"the spatial distribution of a quantity which characterizes the electromagnetic field generated by the antenna\" [129]. In other words, the radiation pattern describes the relative strength of the radiated field in different directions. In general, the radiation pattern is determined in the farfield region. Various plotting formats to represent a radiation pattern exist: Cartesian plot (Fig.  III-2), polar (Fig. III-3(a)) and 3D plot (Fig. III-3(b)). A radiation pattern is composed of several lobes, which may be classified into main, side and back lobes, as described in Fig. III-2. The main lobe is the lobe which determines the direction of maximum radiation. The side lobes are the lobes in any direction other than the main lobe, and in general, are adjoining to the main lobe. The back lobe is the symmetric (180\u00b0) of the main lobe, i.e., the back lobe is oriented in the opposite direction of the main lobe. In most of applications the requested ratio between the main lobe and the side lobe is around -20dB. \n\n\nIII.2.2.2. Beamwidth\n\nThe common definition for the beamwidth is the angular distance created from the main lobe peak to the two points on either side corresponding to the half power (-3dB). For this reason the half power beamwidth (HPBW) is sometimes referred to as the 3dB beamwidth. In Fig. III-3, the beamwidth is represented (blue lines) in polar form. However, we can also present it in Cartesian form.\n\n\nIII.2.2.3. Return loss and reflection coefficient\n\nReturn loss is basically a logarithmic ratio of relative magnitudes of input power ( ) and reflected power ( ):\n\n\nMain lobe\n\nSide lobe\n\nBack lobe (III-1)\n\nThe name \"loss\" comes from the fact that the reflected power cannot exceed the input power; consequently , and should be a positive number.\n\nThe S 11 parameter, or reflection coefficient, also expressed in dB, is the opposite of RL (negative values) \uf0b7 Reflection coefficient:\n\nReflection coefficient (\u0393) is defined as the ratio of the reflected wave to the incident (or forward)\n\nwave. The quantity of interest (magnitude of the reflected wave) is compared to the initial quantity (magnitude of the forward wave):\n(III-2) Since\n, the reflection coefficient is always . This coefficient has a link direct with the S 11 parameter, through the ABCD matrix of S parameters.\n\n\nIII.2.2.4. Bandwidth\n\nThe bandwidth of antenna may be defined as \"the range of frequencies within which the performance of the antenna, with respect to some characteristics, conforms to a specified standard\" [127]. From the center frequency, the range of frequencies which the antenna characteristics (radiation pattern, polarization, input impedance\u2026) are comparable to those of the center frequency, this is the antenna bandwidth. In general, the antenna bandwidth is given in percentage, e.g., a 3% bandwidth indicates the range of frequencies where the antenna performance is still acceptable compared to the center frequency.\n\n\nIII.2.2.5. Antenna efficiency\n\nThe total efficiency describes how much of the power provided to the antenna is radiated or lost within the antenna. The total efficiency can be expressed as a percentage or in decibels. The total efficiency ( ) should take into account the dielectric efficiency ( ) (losses due to dielectric material), conduction efficiency ( ) and reflection mismatch efficiency ( ), as follow:\n(III-3)\n\nIII.2.2.6. Gain\n\nThe antenna gain describes how much power is transmitted in the direction of peak radiation to that of an isotropic source, and it is in general represented in dBi [127]. The absolute gain ( ) is the total efficiency multiplied by the antenna directivity (D):\n\n(III-4) All simulation results of the antenna gain presented in this thesis are extracted from the CST Microwave Studio software. However, in this software the antenna gain (\"realized gain\") is given in dB.\n\n\nIII.2.2.7. Polarization\n\nThe antenna polarization can be defined as the emplacement relation of the traced by the extremity of the time-varying field vectors at a fixed observation point. In other words, it describes the behavior of the field vectors (direction and magnitude) change over time.\n\nDepending on the instantaneous plane wave behavior (electric field vectors position), traveling in a z direction in a farfield zone, the polarization can be classified as linear, circular or elliptical. If the electric field at a point in space as a function of time is always a line, this characterizes a linear polarization. If the X and Y electric field components are 90\u00b0 out of phase and have the same amplitude, the wave plane seen is a circle, namely a circular polarization. Finally, if electric field vectors are two perpendicular components and out of phase with 90 degrees, but not equal in magnitude, this defines an elliptical polarization. However, in practice there are no perfect linearly or circularly polarized antennas, the antennas are often elliptically polarized.     In a radio communication link budget between two antennas Rx and Tx (e.g., DSRC, RFID, Television, radio\u2026), the antenna polarization plays an important role. In practice, the polarization of the receiving antenna is rarely exactly the same as the polarization of the incoming wave. This polarization \"mismatch\" is named the Polarization Loss Factor (PLF) and is defined as follows [127]:\n(III-5) where\nis the unit vector of the incoming wave, is the polarization vector of the receiving antenna and is the angle between the two vectors (E y /E x ). PLF is dimensionless.\n\nFrom (III-5), if the antenna is polarization matched, the PLF is equal to one, i.e., the receiving antenna extracts the maximal power from the incoming plane wave. In Table  III.1 an interesting comparison of the PLF for different polarization patterns, including different antenna types is presented. \n\n\nIII.2.3. Near and Far field regions\n\nWhen measuring antenna radiation pattern or calculating RF link budgets using the Friis power transmission formula, the first underlying criterion is if the Tx and Rx antennas are sufficiently far enough from each other to be considered in the far-field. In [132]- [133] the distance that Tx/Rx should respect for the farfield region is defined by:\n(III-6)\nwhere is the maximal linear dimension of the antenna and is the operating wavelength.\n\nHowever (III-6) is correct if and only if the following criteria are respected: and , as reported in [134].\n\nThe space surrounding an antenna is usually divided into three regions [127]: (a) reactive nearfield, (b) radiating nearfield (Fresnel) and (c) farfield (Fraunhofer), as shown in Fig. III-6. \n\n\n\uf0b7 Reactive nearfield:\n\nIn this region, the reactive power density dominates. It is the region that immediately surrounds the antenna. The outermost boundary of this region is at a distance where is the distance from the antenna surface, is the largest dimension of the antenna and is the wavelength.\n\n\n\uf0b7 Radiating nearfield (Fresnel):\n\nFresnel region is the transition zone between reactive nearfield region and farfield region. In this region the reactive power density becomes lower than the radiating power density. The field pattern has a conventional shape, i.e., its shape is a function of the radial distance, as described in Fig. III-6. The outermost boundary for this region is at a distance where is the distance from the antenna surface.\n\n\n66\n\nChapter III -Antenna design\n\n\n\uf0b7 Farfield (Fraunhofer):\n\nThis region is defined as \"that region of the field of an antenna where the angular field distribution is essentially independent of the distance from the antenna\" [127]. The RF power density varies with the inverse square of the radial distance in this zone. The inner boundary is at the radial distance and the outer one at infinity. In the Fraunhofer region, the pattern is well formed and has, in general, a few minor lobes and one, or more, major lobes, as described in Fig. III-6. In the farfield zone, only the radiation fields exist, the reactive fields are absent.\n\n\nIII.2.4. Different antenna types\n\nMany the antenna types are available in the literature, and the choice of the antenna should be made depending on the final application. In additional to the classical role, of receiver and emitter, in advanced wireless systems the antennas could be employed to suppress or accentuate the radiation energy in a specific direction, and in other cases, the antenna would be used as a simple probing device. In this section, some of the commonly used antennas are briefly described.\n\nLet us start with the dipole; it has been widely studied [135]- [138]. In general, dipoles are composed of two branches each one of a size of /4. Consequently the propagating wave in a dipole travels a total of /2 from the initial point. The typical directivity of the dipole is 2.23dB and the bandwidth is of about 10% [134].\n\nAnother inexpensive and versatile antenna is the loop antenna. Loop antennas are characterized by a \"loop\" of wire or other conductor that is connected to a balun [139]- [143]. There are two categories of loop antennas: electrically small when the antenna size is smaller than a wavelength (magnetic loop), and electrically large when the antenna size is approximately equal to a wavelength (resonant loop). Most of the applications for loop antennas are between the HF (3-30MHz) and UHF (300-3000 MHz). Loop antennas can be also used as a \"probe\" device, as described in [143]. Helical antennas is an easy way to obtain a good circular polarization (excited on axial mode), but they are difficult to fabricate.\n\nThe helical antenna was first described by John Daniel Kraus [144], and it is still employed for different applications [145]- [147]. A particular antenna shape gained an important attention last decades, which we call fractal antennas. In fact, the fractals have their in mathematics. First described by Beno\u00eet Mandelbrot in 1975 as a way of classifying structures where dimensions are not integer numbers, fractals have an unique geometry that occurs in nature. It can be used to describe tree leaves, plants branching, rough terrain, coastline jaggedness, and many other natural elements. However, lately its potential for antenna design was recognized [148]- [157]. It was observed that the fractals radiate electromagnetic energy in an efficient way and with a multiband behavior, i.e., they can radiate multiple wavebands signals when their properties of impedance are compared with those of the Euclidean antennas having the same total size. In [158] and [159], two different fractal shapes (Koch Island and Sierpinski Gasket) were applied for the RFID antenna design. Finally, the most deployed antenna type in different applications is the microstrip antenna, which is described in detail in the next section, pinpointing its advantages and disadvantages.\n\n\nIII.3. Antenna design\n\n\nIII.3.1. Multitoll antenna specifications\n\nAs Multitoll is one of the worldwide turn-key leaders of e-toll solutions, they provided us with the antenna specifications for the DSRC application. These requirements should be rigorously taken into account, since the antennas developed in this thesis are deployed in real applications under protocol regulations. The specifications were the following:\n\n\uf0b7 Low-cost antenna, easy to fabricate and that may be rapidly tested in a real insitu test. \n\n\nIII.3.2. Microstrip antenna\n\nMicrostrip radiators were first described by Deschamps in 1953 [160]. However, only some decades later, in 1970, microstrip antennas were fabricated [161]- [173]. This development accelerated due to the availability of good substrates with low loss tangent and attractive thermal and mechanical specifications. Nowadays, microstrip antennas are fully deployed in different fields and frequencies, due to their numerous advantages, e.g., easy large-scale fabrication, compatibility with integrated circuits, simple and inexpensive manufacturing using modern printed-circuit technology, low weight, low cost, and so on. A good review of microstrip antennas can be found in [174]- [186]. Microstrip antennas are attractively versatile, since the radiator elements can be loaded with lumped elements (e.g., pins and varactor diodes), providing a frequency and/or polarization and/or pattern variation [187]- [192].\n\nA microstrip patch antenna consists in a conductor metal shape (rectangular, circular, ellipse, triangle\u2026) on one PCB face and the ground plane on the other side. Typically, a patch antenna has a gain between 5 and 8 dBi and a -3dB beamwidth between 70\u00b0 and 90\u00b0. A good review of the radiation pattern characteristics as a function of the metal shape is presented in [193].\n\nDepending on the application, the feed method has an important role in the antenna design. Several feeding methods have been reported in the literature, and among them: microstrip line, aperture coupling and coaxial probe [194]- [200]. Microstrip line feed is more appropriate for the integration with RF circuit (front-end), since all the RF parts can be directly printed, as shown in Fig. III-7(a). The microstrip line is easy to fabricate and also to model. Coaxial probe is as well widely used, the inner coaxial conductor is connected to the radiator and the outer coaxial conductor is connected to the ground, Fig.  III-7(b). However, this method requires more attention for design and fabrication, since the inner coaxial conductor passes through the substrate, and a parasitic capacitance can be generated between the inner coaxial conductor and the ground plane. Attention should be also given to the soldering point on the radiator connecting the inner coaxial connector, since the radiator surface is sensible to slight electrical modifications. Finally, aperture-coupled feed is the most difficult to design, Fig. III-7(c). An interesting result of a dual-fed aperture-coupled circularly polarized patch antenna was reported in [201], where general practical guidelines for the design of such antennas have been described. Microstrip antennas have been widely used in different applications due to several advantages intrinsic to their structure. In Table III \n\n\nIII.3.3. DSRC antennas\n\n\nIII.3.3.1. DSRC OBU antenna\n\nIn Chapter II, the DSRC OBU design is presented, a new low-power mode is described and the RF front-end is studied and implemented. Nevertheless, to complete the OBU front-end circuit, Multitoll requested an OBU antenna with a 6dBi gain, left hand circular polarization, simple to be integrated on the OBU PCB and a maximal occupied area of 20cm 2 . Given this, we have decide to design a patch antenna fed by microstrip line.\n\nThe substrate used is ROGERS RT5880, which has a relative dielectric constant of r =2.2, a thickness of h=0.787 mm and a tangent loss of tan =0.0009. The antenna design has been numerically assisted using the antenna analysis software CST Microwave Studio.\n\nThe first step is to match the square patch to the resonant frequency (5.8GHz), by computation of the physical dimensions (W and L). From Fig. III-7(a), to calculate the rectangular microstrip radiating patch dimensions, width W and length L, we will apply the equations (III-7)-(III-10).\n\nThe patch width is determined by:\n(III-7)\nwhere is the speed of light, is the resonant frequency and is the relative dielectric constant of the substrate.\n\nDue to finite length of this antenna, electromagnetic fields at the edge of the patch undergo fringing. Thus, to account for the fields present in the air (fringing) and in the substrate, the effective dielectric constant ( ) is introduced.\n(III-8)\nwhere is the substrate height.\n\nFor the patch length calculus and also due to the fringing effect, the length of the patch increases by a distance of 2 :\n\n(III-9)\n\nFinally, the patch length can be computed as following:\n\n(III-10)\n\nThen an impedance transformer microstrip line is designed at the input of the antenna in order to provide a 50\u03a9 interface. Finally, in order to generate a circular polarization, a well-known method is applied, that consists in triming the ends of two opposite corners of a square patch [202]. The DSRC OBU antenna is presented in Fig. III-8.    \n\n\nIII.3.3.2. DSRC RSE antennas\n\nIn Chapter II, the DSRC link budget is presented, showing the best mounting parameters for an efficient DSRC system. Among the mounting parameters described, the RSE radiation pattern has been considered in the RF link budget model. Even though in the downlink mode (RSE->OBU) the RSE gain is limited by the maximum authorized E.I.R.P. (+33dBm), on the uplink mode (OBU->RSE), the RSE gain plays an important role for the receiving signal. Since the OBU is completely reflexive, the uplink signal is very low, the incoming signal on the RSE needs to be captured by a high-gain antenna.\n\nMultitoll requested two different DSRC antennas: the first one for a specific Stop&Go application and the second one for Free-Flow applications. The first antenna is a 1x3 patch array with superstrate layers enhancing the antenna gain. The second antenna is a patch antenna array with 8 elements and an improvement on the circular polarization due to the sequential rotation feeding.\n\n\nIII.3.3.2.1. Patch antenna array with superstrate\n\nThe first DSRC reader antenna requested by Multitoll it is used for a specific Stop&Go e-toll application. The antenna should be as small as possible, should have a gain so as to provide a minimum OBU distance detection of 17m from the reader and should be lowweight. Another condition was that the antenna would be installed in a lateral post, 4m from the lane, as described in Fig. III-12. Following Multitoll specification, the antenna gain should be around 14dBi.  Microstrip patch antennas can be fed by a variety of methods, as described previously in this section. The feed point position has been optimized in order to provide a circular polarization. The distance between the elements was optimized in order to improve the antenna gain. For this first DSRC antenna, in order to reduce the \"visible antenna surface\", we have decided to implement the feed array on a second layer behind the patch substrate and, through via connections join the radiators, as shown in Fig. III-14. The array feeding network has been designed so as provide equal amplitude and phase signal excitation for each radiating element. In Fig. III-15, a lateral view of the multilayer is presented.  The effect of the via-hole diameter has been studied; the via-hole dimensions were optimized in order to achieve the more suitable response of the antenna return-loss and circular polarization. The effects of the via-hole radius variation on the antenna performances are resumed in Table III.3. As discussed previously the antenna should be small, nevertheless should present a high-gain (~14dBi) and with a 1x3 patch array we could achieve this condition. Various methods are typically used to improve the gain of antennas [203]- [204]. Among them, superstrate layers method is a useful gain enhancement technique that can be used with several antennas types and not required specials designs to be implemented, [205]- [206].\n\nThe superstrate layers are dielectrics that are placed just above the radiated structure in order to guide the radiated waves in a certain direction. This concentrates the energy and increases the directivity. The superstrate layers bend the rays outgoing from the antenna according to Snell's law [203], since that the material has positive electromagnetic properties (\u00b5 > 0, \u025b > 0). The dielectric material characteristics used for the superstrate layers are: \u025b=2.2, \u00b5=1 and tan =0.025. The schema of the patch antenna array with superstrate is described in Fig. III-16. Regarding the superstrate layers design, first of all I have optimized the distance (D 1 ) between the first superstrate layer and the array, and then the distance between layers Finally from the parametric assessment results, the best result for D 1 is 20mm. For D 2 it was observed that the best value of AR is obtained when D 2 =4mm, and conversely the gain best value, when D 2 =6mm. We have decided to chose the AR criterion as more important in this case, and consequently we have chosen D 2 =4mm.\n\nIn order to highlight the gain enhancement due the use of superstrate layers, we have compared the simulated gain of the 1x3 patch antenna array with superstrate to the one of the 1x3 patch antenna array without superstrate; the first is about 13.8dB and second is about 11.3dB. A gain improvement of about 2.5dB is obtained.\n\n\n\uf0b7 Measurements results:\n\nIn order to validate the simulation results, several prototypes have been fabricated. Nevertheless in this manuscript we restrain the results to only two prototypes. Unfortunately at the time where we were developing this antenna, IMEP-LAHC laboratory was not yet equipped with a multilayer printed circuit machine, consequently the vias could not be directly fabricated. Two different PCBs were fabricated (patch antennas and feed array), each one with its respective ground plane, and then metallic wires were used to emulate the vias, connecting the two PCB layers. Next we have assembled the antenna PCB with the superstrate layers, and finally we have accommodated the patch antenna array with the superstrate in a mechanical support for the later fixation on a post for the in-situ tests. Fig. III-19 shows a picture of the final patch antenna array with superstrate ready for the RF characterization and in-situ tests. We proceed with the RF characterization of the assembly, the S 11 measurements are presented in Fig. III-20 and compared with the simulation results. We pursued the measurements, the maximum gain (boresight) and the AR (polarization) have been measured and they are presented in Table III From this preliminary DSRC antenna designed, we can already derive some conclusions. The measured gain follows the theoretical result. On the other hand, for the AR and S 11 results some issues have been identified. From the fabricated antennas, we have observed that because of the hand-made via and consequently the different welding applied, the impedance matching of each prototype is different. The large-scale fabrication feasibility have been also analyzed and we have concluded that the via could be a problem in the fabrication process. Therefore, we have decided to study another solution for the next DSRC antenna (Free-Flow), which should be easy to fabricate on large-scale and presents a lower margin of error between the different fabricated prototypes.\n\nNevertheless, after the RF characterization of the 1x3 patch array with superstrate layers, we have proceeded with the in-situ tests in order to evaluate the antenna performances with the DSRC reader developed by Multitoll. These results are presented in section III.3.3.2.3.\n\n\nIII.3.3.2.2. Patch antenna array with an improved circular polarization\n\nThe second antenna requested by Multitoll, is deployed in Free-Flow e-toll applications. In Free-Flow e-toll configuration, there is no barrier, no toll booths and no cash lanes. Motorists instead experience driving on an open highway (multi lanes) with tolls automatically calculated as they drive through a tolling point, with the only condition of having an OBU inside their vehicles. In generally, in a Free-Flow e-toll sector, each lane is equipped with a RSE. In order to avoid the overlapping zone of the contiguous lobes, the RSE antenna should have a very directional lobe, minimizing the probability of cross-readings and therefore OBU detection misunderstandings.\n\nMoreover, the RSE radiation pattern should also respect other criteria, imposed by DSRC standards and also by Multitoll specifications, e.g., the antenna beamwidth should be 30\u00b0 (vertical plane) and 15\u00b0 (Horizontal plane), the side lobe levels should be lower than -13dB in both planes and the antenna gain should be 15dBi. In addition, the antenna PCB should occupy a maximum area of 289 x 241mm (radome thickness already included) since the antenna is further integrated in the DSRC reader box, as shown in  The RSE antenna array design starts with the patch element construction. In fact, since we have already designed a patch element at 5.8GHz for the OBU (Fig. III-8), we have used this element as start point for this RSE antenna array. The only difference is that for the OBU antenna design, a 50\u03a9 interface (patch element/front-end) has been carried out, Radome + RSE antenna area RSE reader and here, for this RSE antenna array, we conceive the feed network directly connected to the high impedance microstrip feed line at the patch input. As presented for the OBU antenna results, the patch element has already a good LHCP, by truncating the corners of patches. We are interested to preserve and even improve the circular polarization in the array design. We have applied the sequential rotation feeding [207] that consists in enhancing the circular polarization of the array, by applying a specific physical rotation and an electrical delay in each patch element, as described in Fig. III-22. The sequential feeding involves both the rotation of the antenna feed point and its phase feeding. This method has the advantage of improving the axial ratio bandwidth and reducing the mutual coupling between array elements. In Fig. III-22, the distances between the patch elements are optimized in order to obtain lower coupling effects between each element and to improve the antenna gain. For the feed network design we have applied a particular co-simulation method using the CST Studio Suite software, with the purpose of reducing the simulation time. The patch antenna array has been simulated in the 3D CST Microwave Studio environment and the microstrip feed network has been designed in CST Design Studio, as described in Fig.  III-23. The simulation routine implemented consisted in: first, optimizing the feed network providing the sequential electrical delay for each patch element and a good impedance matching, and then the co-simulation (3D environment) in order to obtain the results (S 11 , gain, AR \u2026) of the complete array.  As Multitoll specified, we need to achieve a gain of ~15dBi and a beamwidth of 15\u00b0x30\u00b0. Consequently, from the antenna array theory, we observe that to obtain a beamwidth around 15\u00b0, we need 4 elements, and for 30\u00b0 of beamwidth two elements are sufficient. Finally, we have decided to implement a patch antenna array with 8 elements in the (2x2)x2 form, as shown in Fig. III-24. It should be noticed that the sequential rotation feeding method is still applied, but this time, the electrical/physical delay is of 180\u00b0, as the bloc of patch elements is doubled. For the feeding network design, a co-simulation assessment has been also carried out for the final (2x2)x2 patch antenna array. Finally, after an optimization assessment, the final RSE patch antenna array layout is presented in Fig. III-25. The receiving and transmitting antennas have been already assembled on the same PCB in order to check the coupling effect between the transmission and reception chains. This is a consequence of the fact that the RSE reader produced by Multitoll has two separated chains Tx/Rx, and necessarily, two identical antennas. In Fig. III-25, we can observe that on the PCB border some holes have been done for the fixation. The simulated S parameter results of the RSE antenna are presented in Fig. III-26, S 11 and S 22 represents the reflection mismatch and the S 21 represents the coupling between antennas (Tx/Rx). The simulated gain and axial ratio are presented in Fig. III-27. The radiation pattern results being identical for both antennas, we have plotted only once. From Fig. III-26, a good matching of -18dB for the S 11 and S 22 is observed as well a low coupling (-33dB) between the Tx/Rx antenna. From Fig. III-27, a high simulated gain of 15.8dB is achieved with a good axial ratio for the circular polarization (-1dB).\n\nAs discussed previously the DSRC antenna developed in this thesis is part of a complete DSRC system, and for this reason, some conditions were imposed for the antenna design (physical dimensions, radiation pattern\u2026) as well as for the box where the antenna is inserted (Fig. III-21). The antenna PCB should be inserted in a radome box and the RF sector is isolated from the electronic sector by using a metallic plate, as described in Fig. III-28. The radome is composed of a material with a dielectric constant of 2.2 and a thickness of 5mm. The distance d 2 separates the antenna PCB from the radome top layer, and the distance d 1 separates the metallic plate from the PCB antenna. A numerical parametric assessment has been carried out in order to determine the optimal distance values. However, each distance variation has been analyzed independently in order to reduce the simulation time. For d 2 variation (10mm to 40mm), a slight S 11 deviation has been observed around \u0394S 11 =0.5dB, and on the antenna boresight, the gain fluctuation is around \u0394G=1dB with the axial ratio variation of \u0394AR=0.3dB. Finally, the optimal d 2 value found is 30mm. For the d 1 variation (0mm to 30mm), the antenna performances are weakly affected, within the observed variation of\u03bc \u0394S 11 =0.3dB, \u0394G=0.8dB and \u0394AR=0.6dB. Finally, the optimal d 1 value was 15mm.\n\nIn order to evaluate the assembly (antenna+radome+metallic plate) and reduce the simulation time, we have conducted an original simulation process in CST software. Since we already have the radiation pattern of the patch antenna array alone (Fig. III-27), by using the import farfield CST tool, we can import the farfield result of the antenna into the box and then run the simulation with the \"Integral Equation Solver\", as shown in Fig.  III anymore the antenna PCB with its complex feed network, and we considerably decrease the simulation time (10x).  \n\n\n\uf0b7 Measurements results:\n\nSeveral antenna prototypes have been fabricated and characterized. Given that, in general, the measurement results (S parameters, gain, AR) are quite similar between the prototypes, in this manuscript only results for one prototype are presented. Following MultiToll strategy and requirements, I was in charge of measuring the performances of the antenna, without radome and metallic plate. The whole assembly will be characterized and tested in another time. Fig. III-33 shows the measured S 11 parameters results of both patch antennas array (Tx/Rx).\n\n\n84\n\nChapter III -Antenna design In Fig. III-34, the radiation pattern measurement results are presented for both antennas Tx and Rx on two planes (phi equal to 0\u00b0 and 90\u00b0). From Fig. III-33, a good matching at 5.8GHz can be observed for both antennas Tx and Rx, -24dB and -27dB respectively. The slight difference on the measured S 11 between both antennas comes from the SMA connector soldering, since the inner coaxial conductor is connected to the microstrip feed line through a soldering point, as described in the zoom in Fig. III-35. In Fig. III-34, the radiation pattern measurement results show good form stability for both antennas (Tx/Rx). A maximum gain of 14.3dB has been detected in the boresight direction. Compared to the expected gain (15dB, without radome and metallic plate), the 0.7dB difference is acceptable for an anechoic chamber measurement setup. In Fig.  III-34, the slight inclination of the boresight direction of the radiation pattern measurements comes from the misalignment of the mounting support of the DUT in the anechoic chamber. Regarding the side lobe levels, the measurement results are in good agreement with the side lobe level requested by Multitoll (-13dB). The measured side lobe levels were -17.5dB (phi=0\u00b0, horizontal plane) and -14dB (phi=90\u00b0, vertical plane).\n\n\nIII.3.3.2.3. DSRC RSE antennas in-situ tests\n\nThe RSE antennas developed in this thesis are part of a complete DSRC e-toll system conceived by Multitoll. Once the antenna prototypes have been designed, fabricated and characterized (RF performances) in the IMEP-LAHC laboratory, they were sent to the Multitoll headquarter in Asni\u00e8res to proceed the in-situ tests. Multitoll dedicated an important effort to implement different test scenarios for the validation of the DSRC system. Two emplacements were used for in-situ tests: a parking space in Multitoll headquarter for the static tests and the racecourse circuit in Montlh\u00e9ry for the dynamic tests. During the tests, three detection systems were deployed: RF, camera and magnetic loop. These detection systems are necessary to provide enough information to indentify the vehicle ID. Several parameters have been analyzed, but by far the most important are: the position of the vehicle on the highway lane, the vehicle speed, the type of OBU, the type of vehicle (car, motorcycle, truck), the vehicles in an adjacent lane, the detection and measurement of the static antenna lobe.\n\nIn order to present the two DSRC in-situ scenarios, we show the patch antenna array with superstrate (III.3.3.2.1) under static test (parking) and the patch antenna array with an improved circular polarization (III.3.3.2.2) under dynamic test (racecourse circuit).\n\n\n\uf0b7 Static test (Multitoll parking):\n\nAfter the antenna characterization in the IMEP-LAHC laboratory, the first practical tests are done on the parking of the Multitoll headquarter. The objective of these Ground gap allowing the inner conductor SMA passages.\n\nSoldering point preliminary tests is to evaluate the antenna performances when connected to DSRC reader. In Fig. III-36, a picture of the static tests site is presented. The patch antenna array with superstrate has been developed for a specific Stop&Go application. In order to implement the mounting configuration, described in Fig. III-12, the Multitoll test engineers reproduce the same scenario where the antenna was mounted on a post at 2.3m of height and the OBU moves through a shift axis located 4m from the post. A picture of the static test is shown in Fig. III-37. Fig. III-38 shows in detail how the antenna is connected to DSRC reader. The test consisted in moving the OBU over a shift axis towards the antenna. The objective is to simulate the passages of a car with an OBU. Three different OBU heights have been analyzed (2m, 1.5m and 1.2m). Two types of static tests have been carried out, one with the OBU mounted in a hand support, as described in Fig. III-37, and a second test where the OBU is placed insight a vehicle (ford Ka). For each OBU height, the detection zone has been measured. The measurement results are presented in Table III.5  and Table III In order to evaluate the complete DSRC system, Multitoll had rent a racecourse circuit.   In Fig. III-40, we have a picture of the e-toll detection devices installed on the racecourse of Montlh\u00e9ry, we can thus observe the DSRC RSE (antenna+reader), the camera and the RFID antenna/reader. The RFID antenna has been developed in another project and it is also being used in some countries for e-toll applications. Several the DSRC transactions have been tested (wake-up, complete transaction \u2026) and as well different traffic scenarios, i.e., vehicles may be in any position across the road and may change lane anywhere in the toll charging area, and usually here is more than one vehicle. Some of the different scenarios tested are described in the next tables. For each scenario, the parameter that confirms a complete DSRC transaction is the BIP sound emitted by the OBU.  Recently Multitoll has started to install a DSRC system in Portugal, where the conditions requested are even more challenging, since the e-toll station should be implemented in a highway curve. In Fig. III-42 we have some preliminary pictures of the DSRC systems installed.  \n\n\nIII.3.4. Wireless Energy Harvesting antennas\n\nIn Chapter IV, two high-efficiency rectenna are presented. From the rectifier perspective, we demonstrate that an optimal RF-DC load is required in order to achieve high RF-DC conversion efficiency. From the antenna perspective, two important points should be analyzed: avoiding that the high-order harmonics are radiated by the antenna and matching the antenna input impedance and the input impedance of the rectifier. Both antennas are designed by using ROGERS 4003 substrate (\uf065 r =3.55 and tan(\uf064)=0.0027) with a thickness of 0.813 mm.\n\n\nIII.3.4.1. Antenna design (Rectenna #1)\n\nFor the first rectenna studied, the antenna and the rectifier design are executed separately, i.e., first of all the high-efficiency rectifier has been created with a 50\u03a9 interface and then the high-orders harmonic-rejection antenna has been conceived also with a 50\u03a9 interface. This section explains the antenna design and in Chapter IV (IV.5.2) we detail the design of the rectifier.\n\nThe antenna design starts with the creation of the patch element (as presented before for the OBU antenna at 5.8GHz). A 2.45GHz patch element has been conceived with the detail that the two opposite corners are trunked in an optimization process in order to provide a good circular polarization [202]. Then an 1x2 array has been conceived with the purpose of enhancing the antenna gain. The power divider has been shaped directly on the high impedance microstrip lines (microstrip feed line of the patch element). As detailed in Chapter IV, due to the non-linear behavior of the diode Schottky, harmonics are generated. Since the fundamental frequency is 2.45GHz, the second and third harmonics are at 4.9 and 7.35 GHz. To avoid the radiation of these harmonics by the antenna, two BPF stubs have been implemented at the antenna input, as shown in Fig. III-43. By tuning the size of these stubs, high-order harmonics can be blocked or passed. In Fig. III-44, we present the S 11 parameter of the antenna with and without the BPF stubs. Due to the BPF stubs effect, the second (4.9GHz) and third (7.35GHz) harmonics are clearly blocked, as described in Fig. III-44. The simulated radiation pattern of the 1x2 patch antenna array (rectenna #1) is presented in Fig. III-45. Since we have a 1x2 patch antenna array, with each patch element fed by the same amplitude and phase delay, a 6.7dB gain has been achieved.  \n\n\nFrequency (GHz)\n\n\nAntenna WITH BPF stubs Antenna WITHOUT BPF stubs\n\nFinally, the rectenna #1 layout is presented in Fig. III-46 with the patch antenna array connected to the rectifier by using a 50\u2126 interface. \n\n\nIII.3.4.2. Antenna design (Rectenna #2)\n\nFor the second rectenna development, the rectifier has been co-designed with the patch antenna array. The aim of this co-design is to reduce the rectenna size. First of all, the patch antenna array has been designed, but this time I did not create a 50\u03a9 interface, as described in Fig. III-47. The simulated input impedance of the antenna (Zant in ) has been acquired from the CST software and then this value has been imported into the ADS software in order to implement the high-efficiency rectifier considering the antenna impedance. The input matching network of the rectifier has been concatenated with the BPF stubs as can be observed in Fig. III-48. A numerical parametric assessment has been carried out in the ADS interface with the purpose of tuning the BPF stubs in order to reject harmonics.  The rectenna#2 final layout is presented in Fig. III-49, where the matching network with the BPF stubs can be observed. Since for the antenna of the rectenna #2 there is no 50\u03a9 interface, the antenna measurements could not be done. Nevertheless, a balun could be designed in order to allow the antenna measurements. \n\n\nIII.4. Conclusion\n\nThis Chapter introduced the main antenna results obtained in this thesis. We have started with a general introduction of the antenna theory and \"classical\" antenna fundamentals. In the antenna fundamentals section, an important review of the field regions around the antenna has been described. This knowledge is important for the future work of our team with rectenna in a nearfield.\n\nBased on the antenna specifications required by Multitoll, in the antenna design section, we have presented and defended that the microstrip antennas are attractive and versatile for different applications. Consistently, we have widely applied microstrip antennas in our developments.\n\nDue to the special context of this thesis, i.e., at the same time practical and reliable antenna solutions for the Multitoll Company applications, as well as a research perspective to further the State-of-the-Art on different ideas. As a result, the section on antenna design clearly contains two different applications (DSRC and Wireless Energy Harvesting antennas). This distinction has already been justified and described in Chapter II.\n\nFor the DSRC antennas design, since the OBU antenna requirements were simples, we start our development from it. A 5.8GHz patch antenna has been designed and good results have been achieved. This antenna will be integrated in the OBU device produced by Multitoll later. The second studied, fabricated and characterized antenna is the 1x3 patch array with superstrate layers. We have successfully designed this antenna that has a high gain and a small \"visible surface\" (constraint imposed by Multitoll). Nevertheless, an issue has been detected for the reproducibility of the antenna prototypes due to the vias connections. Therefore we have decide to use a different feeding method for the next antennas, which should be easy to fabricate in large-scale and presents a lower margin of error between the fabricated prototypes.\n\nThe third DSRC antenna developed is based on a patch antenna array with 8 elements and has a special sequential rotation feeding that allowed us to considerably improve the antenna polarization. Once the antenna PCB design established, since this antenna should be inserted in a real box with a DSRC reader, we studied and optimized the antenna considering the radome and metallic plate (for RF/electronic separation).\n\nBoth DSRC reader antennas have been tested in-situ settings as described in section III.3.3.2.3. In general, the detection results have been corrected. A special remark goes to the patch antenna array with 8 elements and an improved circular polarization, due the good in-situ results, Multitoll integrated the antenna in the DSRC system deploying this antenna in different countries and applications.\n\nFinally, as described on Chapter IV, high-efficiency rectenna have been developed and good results have been achieved. Since rectennas are a combination of a rectifier and an antenna, then in this chapter we have explained the design of the antennas for both rectennas developed in this thesis.\n\n\nChapter IV -Wireless Energy Harvesting\n\n\nIV.1. Introduction to Wireless Energy Harvesting\n\nRF powered circuits have been demonstrated for more than 50 years [208], but only a few have been able to harvest energy from freely available ambient RF sources. It is important to remind that wireless energy transfer is different from wireless energy harvesting, the first one is deployed for high RF power density (e.g., dedicated source) and the second one for low RF power density (e.g., ambient energy), as described in Chapter I.\n\nThe aim in a Wireless Energy Harvesting (WEH) framework is to profit the \"free\" RF energy already existent in the environment around us and by means of a high-efficiency RF-DC conversion to supply low-power devices. Radiofrequency (RF) signals are deliberately radiated by broadcasting station antennas (GSM, radio, television\u2026), but energy can also be simply radiated without license in the Industrial-Scientific-Medical (ISM) applications frequency bands [208]. Harvesting RF energy directly from the base stations could be affected by long-term fluctuations due to radio tower service schedules and human activity patterns, and by short-term variability due to fading and noise [209]- [210]. Mobile phones represent a large source of transmitters and could be used to harvest RF energy and as the number of mobile subscription will definitely continue to increase. Another way of harvesting RF energy is to use RFID for powering electronic devices [211]- [213]. Nowadays, considering the numbers of houses, buildings and even urban environments that are equipped with WiFi routers [214], one can straightforwardly imagine that wireless sensors could be powered by means of WiFi waves. In an indoor scenario, WiFi signals have become serious candidates for energy harvesting, since the alternative harvesting sources (solar, wind \u2026) are not sufficiently available and the RF broadcasting signals (TV, GSM\u2026) are weak inside buildings. In this thesis, several rectifiers/rectenna were designed for Wireless Energy Harvesting, at 2.45 GHz, in the ISM band, that also includes WiFi routers.\n\nIn a wireless energy harvester, the amount of power available for the load depends on several factors including the source power, the distance from the source, the receive antenna gain and the conversion efficiencies, as shown in Fig. IV The available power from the receive antenna ( ) depends on the power density available ( ) and on the effective aperture area of the antenna ( ).\n\nThe RF available power is given by:\n(IV-1)\nwhere the power density is defined by:\n(IV-2)\nwith , the effective radiated power (EIRP) (in W) and , the distance from the transmitter (in m).\n\nFinally, the effective aperture area of the antenna is given by:\n(IV-3)\nIn (IV-1), is the rectifier antenna efficiency, is the rectifier antenna directivity and is the wavelength (in m).\n\nIn this thesis we intend to increase the RF-DC conversion efficiency ( ). The development in this work will be restrained to the rectifier design presented in the box I (dashed/dotted box), as shown in Fig. IV-1. The box II (dashed box) will be modeled as a RF load (capacitor and resistor in parallel). Subsequently, the RF-DC conversion efficiency ( ) is directly proportional to the DC power ( at the DC load terminals, divided by the RF input power ( ), as in (IV-4). It is essential to increase the DC power in order to amplify the RF-DC efficiency.\n\n(  where (in W) is the following:\n(IV-5)\ndefines the output voltage (in V) and the load resistor (in \u03a9). Another definition for the DC output power is available taking into account the RF link:\n(IV-6)\nThe amount of power arriving at the load terminals ( ) depends on the different conversion efficiencies included in a WEH description, as shown in Fig. IV-1. In (IV-7) the expression of the power at load terminals is presented.\n(IV-7)\nDepending on the type of the antenna chosen, the efficiency ( ) may vary from 20% (monopole) to 95% (horn antennas [215]) or 97% (UWB monopole antenna [216]). The DC-DC converter bloc is used to adapt the rectified voltage to a rechargeable battery voltage. A minimum input voltage is required by the DC-DC converter to produce the preset output voltage. In previous studies, several DC-DC converters were reported, e.g., in [217] a 25% DC-DC conversion efficiency was achieved; in [218] a discrete buckboost converter with an efficiency of 69% is described; and more recently, a DC-DC peak of 72% was reported in [219].\n\nTo improve the DC output power one needs to look up for the RF-DC conversion efficiency, to have an important power density available around the WEH device and the WEH's antenna should have a gain as high as physically possible.\n\nFor RF-DC conversion efficiency, several research groups have presented different results, quite a few papers introduce high-efficiency rectifiers results, but hardly any elucidate in detail how to achieve high efficiency levels with a single diode and a simple load, as presented in the State-of-the-Art Chapter I (I.1.4.4.2).\n\nThe first rectenna (RECtifier + anTENNA) to be designed using a full-wave electromagnetic simulator dates from a few years ago, 1998, [220]. Preceding rectenna devices have been developed using transmission-line models, Touchstone, and others [221] - [222].\n\nDifferent papers have taken as factor of merit for the WEH design the output voltage ( ) parameter, [222]- [223]. We believe that this assumption is not really accurate, i.e., the output voltage depends on the load resistor used in the WEH device. It is obvious that we can increase the output voltage by changing the load resistor value and moreover, a high output voltage does not mean the maximum DC power conversion is reached. In our approach, the factor of merit for WEH design is the RF-DC conversion efficiency as defined in (IV-4). We have chosen this parameter as figure of merit to clarify and to standardize the efficiency definitions for various practical applications of RF energy harvesting.\n\nAnother important point to smooth the progress of comparison of different energy harvesting sources (solar, thermal, mechanical,..) is the normalization of the recovered power as a function of the available power density, as shown in the Chapter I , i.e., with units of \u00b5W/cm 2 or \u00b5W/cm 3 .\n\nThe key component for the RF to DC conversion is the diode, which will be presented in the next section.\n\n\nIV.2. Zero-bias Schottky Diode modeling\n\nSince nearly the beginning, the Schottky diode has been used to RF/microwave mixing and rectifying circuits. However, for the specific harvesting applications using W power, obtaining a satisfying RF-DC conversion efficiency is restricted by physical limitations of the diode. A recently good review of low-power microwave-to-dc energy conversion techniques [224], points out the limitations imposed due to diode's high zero-bias junction resistance. The Schottky diode is the principal element of a WEH device, therefore it is important to provide a correct model. Zero-bias diodes are necessary because they have relatively low barrier (high saturation current), which compared to externally biased detector diodes, results in a higher output voltage for low power input levels. The equivalent electrical circuit of a Schottky diode is shown Fig. IV-2. with the junction capacitance (diode voltage dependent) (in Farad), the bulk series resistance (in \u03a9) and the junction resistance of the diode (in \u03a9).\n\nIn order to obtain the maximum output, all the incoming RF voltage should ideally appear across with no losses over , so for low-power applications we are interested to choose a diode with the smallest series resistance value. The intrinsic diode is modeled as a varistor element that obeys the i-v law, as described in [225]:\n(IV-8)\nwhere is the diode's saturation current and is the reciprocal of the thermal voltage, is the electronic charge, is Boltzmann's constant, is the physical temperature in Kelvins, and is the diode ideality factor (emission coefficient).\n\nTherefore the saturation current is given by:\n(IV-9)\nwhere is a reference temperature. The quantity is the metalsemiconductor Schottky barrier height (energy gap) at (e.g., 0.85 eV for A1 on GaAs).\n\nThe Schottky diodes can be organized in two main classes. The first class consists in a n-type silicon with a high-barrier and low values of series resistance (e.g., mixer applications and detectors where DC bias is available). The second class consists in ptype silicon and is characterized by low barrier and high (e.g., square law detector applications where load resistance is high and DC bias is not available). For WEH applications we are interested to use the second class (p-type diode). Although we have a high series resistance, the higher saturation current of the p-type diode results in a higher output voltage at low power levels compared to a n-type (100 times), as shown in [226].\n\nIn Fig. IV-3, the simulated output voltage for two commercial Schottky diodes is presented: HSMS-285X (p-type) and HSMS-8205 (n-type). The diodes are loaded by a 1k\u2126 load resistor. In Fig. IV-3, different voltage profiles can be observed between high and low power levels. In [225] it was demonstrated that diode detectors exhibit true square-law behavior at low power levels, and that at higher power levels there is a gradual change to a linear (peak-detecting) law. From Fig. IV-3 we can also notice that for low incident power applications, e.g., WEH, the p-type Schottky diode is recommended since it provides a higher output voltage when compared to the n-type (10 2 x).\n\nFrom (IV-8), the value of of the diode decreases due to the value of circulating current , i.e., the diode impedance being dependent of the RF input power. The junction capacitance has a large impact ahead the output voltage at high frequencies and when the series resistance has high values. The impact of the series resistance on the output DC voltage has been described in [226]. A simple multiplier parameter for the output voltage has been defined (IV-10) related to the 3 components of the equivalent electrical circuit of Chapter IV -Wireless Energy Harvesting a Schottky diode (Fig. IV-2). If the series resistance increases the output voltage is strongly reduced by the multiplier M.\n\n(IV- 10) where is the angular frequency (in rd/s).\n\nDepending on the final application, the output voltage will be the primary goal of the harvester design. Nevertheless, the RF-DC conversion efficiency explicitly describes how powerful the rectifier is. A compromise should be obtained between a high-efficiency value and a specific output voltage required for a RF energy harvester.\n\nIn Fig. IV-4, two typical harvester configurations are presented, a single diode and a voltage doubler. Obviously the voltage doubler provides a higher output than the single diode; however the RF-DC conversion efficiency is lower, as widely demonstrated in the literature [227]- [228]. The doubler puts the Schottky diodes in parallel with respect to the input RF signal, thus lowering the input impedance and reducing the complexity of the impedance matching network.  As shown in Fig. IV-5, a single diode converter reaches only 45% of efficiency but it is for the smallest RF power (around -15dBm). This low input power is the main constraint for a WEH converter.\n\nAs described before, the diode junction type can be determinant on a WEH device, the HSMS-285X (2850 and 2855) is p-type silicon and the HSMS-8205 is a n-type silicon. For low incident power an important difference on the output voltage can be noticed between both silicon types; the p-type diode presents a higher output voltage for low incident power, when compared to the n-type diode. Moreover, with a single diode, a high efficiency can be reached for low RF input power.\n\n\n\uf0b7 Analytical and numerical analysis\n\nDue to nonlinear behavior it is not trivial to predict a correct model of a Schottky diode. When modeling, one should take into account the presence of the harmonics and the diode input impedance variation as a function of the input power. In general, we need a numerical support to obtain an accurate result.\n\nIn Fig. IV-6, the calculated input impedance values for three commercially available Schottky diodes are presented as a function of incident input power. Diodes analyzed: Avago HSMS-2850, HSMS-2855 and HSMS-8205. The diodes are loaded by a shortcircuit. In Fig. IV-6, it is important to notice that for low power levels (<-25dBm) the input impedance remains almost constant for all the diodes. From an incident power greater than -25dBm, the input impedance of the HSMS-285X diodes starts to change, because these diodes have been designed and optimized to be used for small signal applications, differently of the HSMS-8205.\n\n\n\uf0b7 Schottky diode choice:\n\nFor the all the WEH prototypes developed in this thesis, we employed the AGILENT HSMS-285X zero-bias Schottky p-type detector diode. The diode has a low built-in voltage of 0.35V, a breakdown voltage of 3.8V, a series resistance of 25\u2126 and a zero-bias junction capacitance of 0.18pF. Its packaging is a surface Mount SOT-23.\n\nFirst of all a numerical diode model proposed by ADS (Advanced Design System) software was studied and its performances were validated with the S parameter measurements. Initially, I have simulated the HSMS-2855 Schottky diode in ADS software loaded by a 50\u2126 port for small signal, as shown in Fig. IV-7. I designed and fabricated the DUT (Device Under Test) circuit board for the diodes in series (as described in Fig. IV-7) and the calibration standards circuits (Thru-Reflect-Line), as shown in Fig. IV-8. \n\n\nHSMS-2850, Re(Z) HSMS-2850, Im(Z) HSMS-2855, Re(Z) HSMS-2855, Im(Z) HSMS-8205, Re(Z) HSMS-8205, Im(Z)\n\nNext, I performed the measurement of the S parameters of the diode with the VNA (Vector Network Analyzer HP/AGILENT 8510C). A TRL calibration method (previously described by [229]) has been used to suppress the influence of the access lines.   The measured and simulated results are in good agreement between 1.5 and 2.5 GHz (around 3 GHz, the value of S 11 shows a difference of ~0.2 dB). We consider that the numerical model of the diode proposed by AGILENT is correct for small signal analysis. An important signal reflexion can be observed in the measurements presented in Fig.  IV-9. This is acceptable since there is no impedance matching network in this measurement setup. Given that the HSMS-2855 measurements results are in agreement with the ADS model, we assume that the ADS model for the second diode HSMS-2850 is also correct, as they are part of the same diode series (285X).\n\nFor all WEH prototypes developed in this chapter, we consider an operating frequency of 2.45 GHz, which is included in the ISM band, and we decided to use a single diode configuration since we are looking for high RF-DC conversion efficiency. For this frequency, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) specifies a transmitted power of 1W with up to 6dB antenna gain. As the diode is not a linear device, when the RF signal reaches the diode, harmonic signals will be generated and as a result this energy could be lost on the DC load or irradiated by the antenna.\n\nThe diode impedance should be observed taking into account the RF input power variation. Fig. IV-10 shows the range of the input diode impedance for the fundamental RF signal (f 0 ), 2 nd (2f 0 ) and 3 rd (3f 0 ) harmonics from -30dBm to +10dBm input RF power. A color gradient was used to indicate the input power variation; blue corresponds to low input power and red to high input power. The magnitude of the diode impedance decreases with the increasing incident power. The black marker * in Fig. IV-10 corresponds to the diode impedance Z D for a RF input power of 0dBm; the impedance values (in \u03a9) are\u03bc Z D (f 0 )=143-j68, Z D (2f 0 )=68-j41 and Z D (3f 0 )=49+j3.6 (j is the complex number which corresponds to j 2 =-1) .

Schottky diode AGILENT HSMS-2855.\n\n\nIV.3. Analysis of the optimum load impedance to improve the RF-DC conversion efficiency\n\nIn the simple case of a detector diode it is possible to show that in the frequency domain the result of a RF signal passage leads to a continuous (DC) signal, a signal and other harmonics. The conversion efficiency is maximally 25% accounting for the insertion loss of the diode for a RF input power of 0 dBm, as presented in [226].\n\nTo confirm harmonics generation, I have simulated a simple circuit with a diode and a 50\uf057 load connected in series (as shown in Fig. IV-11). The RF input power was 0dBm and we have assumed that there is no reflection loss. On DC and on the second harmonic , the difference in the power generated is around -18dBm when compared to the fundamental frequency peak. The DC power conversion is low in these conditions. Moreover, after the RF-DC conversion, considerable power still remains in the fundamental and in the second harmonic , as shown in Fig. IV-11. In a common WEH To increase the RF-DC conversion efficiency by using a simple Schottky diode, it is necessary to exploit the energy in the fundamental, boosting the DC output power. We can make the analogy of placing a mirror after the diode; this affects the RF signals ( in a particular manner for each frequency, as shown in Fig. IV-12. This RF mirror is technically implemented by an optimum load. We have evaluated different load cases, in order to prove that to increase the RF-DC conversion efficiency, an important impedance matching between the Schottky diode and the load is required. Furthermore, the fundamental and second harmonic frequencies have been taken into account.\n\nWe have developed an original measurement setup, where different values of the load impedance (capacitive or inductive) were presented at the output terminal of a Schottky diode. This measurement setup consisted in injecting a RF signal on the Schottky diode, varying the RF load impedance, and then acquiring the output voltage to compute the RF-  A picture of the measurement setup is presented in Fig. IV-14. The generator that I have used is the Synthesized Signal Generator ANRITSU 68367C and the output voltage has been measured by means of the Digital Multimeter KEITHLEY 2000E. A directional coupler was used to pass on the incident RF power ( ) to the diode and also to acquire the reflected RF power ( from the rectifier. We have designed a printed circuit board (PCB) to insert the diode (Fig. IV-15(b)) and two quarter-wavelength microstrip lines provided the access to the diode terminals and facilitated the impedance transformation calculus. The frequency of the RF signal is 2.45GHz. The setup was calibrated in order to supply an incident RF power around 0dBm on the diode anode. The DC load consisted in a resistor (1k\u2126) connected in parallel with a capacitor (10pF), as shown in (Fig. IV-15(a)). The Schottky diode is an AGILENT HSMS-2855. The first part of our measurements analysis consisted in determining the RF-DC conversion efficiency for different load impedance values. Fig. IV-16 shows the measurement results of the RF-DC conversion efficiency for a Schottky diode loaded with different RF load impedance values. From the output voltage measurements, the RF-DC efficiency was computed for a RF input signal of 0dBm, using (IV-4) and (IV-5). The maximum RF-DC efficiency ( ) measured in these conditions is approximately 25%. This low value is due to the measurement setup losses, particularly to the CCMT losses.\n\nFor the full understanding of the problem, efficiency values were normalized with respect to the maximum measured efficiency value ( ), since the aim of this measurement is not to achieve a high RF-DC value, but identify the optimum load impedances which improve the RF-DC conversion.\n\nOn the Smith chart in Fig. IV-16, four regions are detectable: east side (blue color) where the load impedance values represent a low RF-DC conversion efficiency (<25% of ), middle and south/southwest (green color) region where the RF-DC efficiency varies from 25% to 50% of . A small part of the northwest region (yellow color), shows RF-DC efficiency values between 50% and 75%. Finally, a particular part of the north region (red color), illustrates a RF-DC efficiency around the maximum value (>75% of ). It is important to notice that on certain borderlines of the regions, a slight shift in the RF load impedance can change considerably the RF-DC conversion efficiency (e.g., north region red/blue border). The observed strong sensibility will be elucidated in the next sections (rectifiers design).\n\nA second part of the measurement analysis ( Fig. IV-13), consisted in discriminating the reflected RF power (f 0 , 2f 0 , 3f 0 ) and the DC power level on the DC load terminals for several load impedances. The reflected RF signals were measured directly on the spectrum analyzer due to the directional coupler and the DC power was calculated, (IV-4) and (IV-5), from the output voltage measured on the resistor terminals. The spectrum analyzer I used is the ANRITSU MS2668C.  For the Z d case, practically all the f 0 signal ( is reflected, just a low DC signal being generated ( . Z f is a capacitive load and has approximately the same imaginary part as the impedance of the Schottky diode (for a RF input power of 0dBm), the reflected power of the 2f 0 harmonic signal is reduced, and consequently the DC power is increased. For the Z e case, a 50\u2126 impedance, the impedance matching affects the f 0 reflected signal, the RF reflected signal is reduced and as a result, the DC power is increased.\n\nFinally, Z b and Z a are two impedances, with different real parts, but the same imaginary part. Therefore, an increase in the RF-DC efficiency is induced as a result of the DC power amplification. The Z a impedance (lower real part) provides the maximum RF-DC conversion efficiency. From Fig. IV-16, the RF-DC conversion efficiency is maximal in a particular region. In Fig. IV-18 the optimum load is presented as a function of the DC power and the reflected power. In order to better understand the correlation between the optimal impedance value and maximum RF-DC conversion efficiency, two case studies were investigated: 1) Case study 1: The impedance matching between the diode and the RF load. The imaginary part of the RF load impedance in the red region ( Fig.  IV-16) is approximately the opposite of imaginary part of the diode impedance (Z D ) for a RF input power of 0dBm (Fig. IV-10). It seems that the diode impedance is matched by the symmetric imaginary part of the RF load impedance, thus the RF-DC maximum peak appears. In order to detail and verify in-depth this case, three prototypes were developed: rectifier prototypes #1, #2 and #3 (subtopic: IV.5.1).\n\n2) Case study 2: The electrical delay created by the RF load for f 0 frequency (and perhaps for the harmonic 2f 0 ) could be the origin of the high-efficiency conversion by an optimal diode voltage recombination. In Fig. IV-16, for the highly efficient RF-DC load (red region), the phase delay created by the RF load for the fundamental signal f 0 is around 45\u00b0 for one-way propagation and consequently, the f 0 signal will be reflected into the diode terminals with a 90\u00b0 delay. For the second harmonic (2f 0 ), the optimal RF load is seen as an opencircuit, thus an important amount of the energy of the 2f 0 will be completely reflected into the diode. For further detailing and investigation of this case, two prototypes were developed: rectifier prototype #4 and #5 (subtopic: IV.5.1). \n\n\nIV.4. Microstrip line\n\nFirst described in 1952 [230]- [231], a microstrip line is a wide-band transmission system in which the electro-magnetic waves are propagated through a dielectric medium bonded by a strip conductor on one side and a conducting ground plane on the other side. Using microstrip line, the manufacture of microwave plumbing reduces to a printed circuit technique, susceptible of great accuracy, adaptable to mass production and resulting in great savings in cost, space and weight. The characteristic impedance ( ) can be computed as follows:\n\n(IV-12)\n\nNow, if we consider that the microstrip line is loaded by the impedance and we assume that the microstrip line has only few losses, a good approximation of the input impedance can be calculated by the famous following equation [230]:\n(IV-13)\nwith , the propagation constant and L the length of the physical line.\n\nThe propagation constant is defined as:  where is the wavelength inside the transmission line and is given by: \n\n\nIV.5. WEH device design\n\nIn the previous section, two possibilities were evoked to be the underlying reasons to improve the RF-DC conversion efficiency in WEH design. In this section we will test these two concepts by designing different prototypes, in order to verify which assumption is correct.\n\nFive RF-DC prototypes have been designed, each one with particular specifications described in section IV.5.1. Among these rectifiers, the one with the best measured performance was chosen to be integrated to an antenna, thus becoming a rectenna (section IV.5.2). For all the WEH devices developed in this thesis, the Schottky diodes used are from the same series AVAGO-HSMS-285X (2850 and 2855), i.e., they have same electrical characteristics, but different packages.\n\nThe rectifiers have been designed and optimized using the \"Harmonic Balance\" (HB) method of AGILENT ADS software, a frequency-domain simulator developed to account for the nonlinear effects of the diode.\n\nThe substrate employed is the ROGERS 4003 (\uf065 r =3.55 and tan(\uf064)=0.0027) with a thickness of 0.813 mm.\n\n\nIV.5.1. Design of rectifiers\n\nThe first rectifier prototype (#1) has been optimized in order to present for the output diode terminal a particular load, its imaginary part cancelling out the diode imaginary part for a 0dBm RF input power.\n\nThe second rectifier prototype (#2) has been designed using the same criteria as the prototype #1, but the RF input power target was of -15dBm.\n\nFor the third rectifier prototype (#3), a different impedance matching process has been applied. Nevertheless the objective was the same as for the previous prototypes, that is, to cancel the imaginary part of the diode impedance, but at the input of the diode. The RF input power target was of -15dBm.\n\nThe forth rectifier prototype (#4) has been implemented to reach a particular electrical delay for f 0 frequency (and an open-circuit for the 2f 0 frequency) by means of a new load design. The RF input power target was of -15dBm.\n\nFinally, the last rectifier prototype (#5) is quite similar to the rectifier #4 with a slight modification in the width (W) of the microstrip line of the load.\n\n\nIV.5.1.1. Rectifier prototype #1\n\nFirst of all, we need to recover the simulated input impedance of the diode. From The load impedance consists in a microstrip line and a DC load (capacitor in parallel with a resistor). We have chosen a capacitor of 10nF, i.e., seen as a short-circuit at 2.45GHz. Thus we need to add a microstrip line of a length that compensates the imaginary part of the diode impedance. The resistor value does not affect the RF power, because it is short-circuited by the capacitor. Its optimization will be detailed later.\n\nTo have at the input of the microstrip line (loaded by a capacitor) an imaginary part equal to a Z in = j68 \u2126, the dimensions of the microstrip load line are\u03bc length L=9.23 mm and width W=1.24 mm. Consequently, the effective dielectric constant is equal to 2.694 and the input impedance (microstrip only) is 62 \u2126.  A matching network has been implemented, at the input of the diode, in order to guarantee a 50\u2126 matching. In the circuit input, I have conceived a low-pass filter in order to reflect the harmonics into the diode. For this first prototype, we have decided to design the matching network separately from the filter, in order to analyze the importance of each block independently. For this purpose, Fig. IV-21 shows the RF-DC efficiency for each block combination of this rectifier #1. Each curve is designed by connecting block by block in order to have the complete system.\n\nCombination 1 (named \"Di+Lo\") has no impedance matching between the diode and the load, the diode directly connected to a simple DC load (resistor and capacitor), and the efficiency is very low 9% @ 0dBm, as presented in Fig. IV-21 combination 1. When the diode is combined with a matching network at the input and the DC load (combination 2 named \"Mn+Di+Lo\"), a RF-DC efficiency of 47% is achieved, since there is more RF power arriving at the diode input.\n\nFor combination 3 (named \"Mn+Di+Ml+Lo\") an optimized RF load is added, i.e., the imaginary part of Z D(f0) is cancelled out. In this case the efficiency increases to 67% @ 0dBm RF input power.\n\nIn combination 4 (named \"Fi+Mn+Di+Ml+Lo\"), a low-pass filter is added at the input and we reach an efficiency of 68%.   \n\n\n4) Fi + Mn + Di + Ml + Lo\n\nFurthermore, to find the optimal load we have investigated the impact of the resistor on the RF-DC conversion efficiency for the prototype #1. Fig. IV-23 shows the RF-DC conversion efficiency versus the RF input power for various DC loadings. The best efficiency, i.e., 70% occurs at a 1.8k\u2126 loading for 1dBm RF input power (and 68% @ 0dBm). The efficiency gradually decreases as the load resistance increases.   The measurement setup is presented in Fig. IV-26. The Synthesized Signal Generator ANRITSU 68367C provides the RF input power and allows the power to be varied. In addition, an isolator provides additional protection against the reflected energy. By varying the RF input power (P RF ), the DC voltage has been measured across the DC load, and then the RF-DC conversion efficiency has been calculated. In Fig. IV-27, we compare the simulated and measured results. First, high efficiency and output voltage of 70% and 1.2V, respectively, were measured for 0 dBm RF input power. Measurements show better results than simulation ( Fig. IV-27(a)). It is important to notice that in the design of rectifiers/rectennas, from a certain input power threshold, the efficiency curve decreases considerably, as shown in Fig. IV-27(a). This phenomenon occurs when the reverse peak voltage of the diode becomes larger than the breakdown voltage and the resultants conversion efficiencies begin to decrease [232].\n\nSecond, around a specific RF input power equal to 2dBm, a discontinuity on output voltage simulation results can be noticed (Fig. IV-27(b)). Agilent ADS numerical model has a limit parameter (explosion current) for the diode junction current linearization. If the current is linearized, no DC voltage can be obtained, that is why the DC simulated voltage in Fig. IV-27(b) is flat from 2dBm. Nevertheless, the aim of this thesis is to convert a RF input power lower than 0dBm.\n\nThird, the shift between measurement and simulation results, in Fig. IV-27(a), could come from three possible issues. A possibility is that the real quality factor (Q) of the capacitor used was not plausible. Another issue has been observed, because the diode parasitic elements were not specifically taken into account; we will detail this issue in the next paragraphs. Finally, I have detected that a mechanical variation of the hand-made inductance (RF-block) affected the measurement results. It reinforces the fact that the impedance of the optimal load is sensitive.\n\nTo investigate the possible cause of the difference between measurement and simulation results, S 11 parameter has been studied. Fig. IV-28 shows the simulated and measured S 11 parameter for the rectifier #1. A frequency shift can be observed between the S 11 simulations and measurements results of the rectifier #1 (Fig. IV-28). After some analyses, we have come to the conclusion that this bias is introduced by the diode parasitic elements. Next, the parasitic elements have been represented by a series inductor (L p ) and parallel capacitor (C p ). The Schottky diode model considering the parasitic elements is presented in Fig. IV   From this first high-efficient rectifier design, three important points need to be considered for the design of the next rectifiers:\n\n\uf0b7 Parasitic elements of the Schottky diode.\n\n\uf0b7 Quality factor of capacitor. A correct simulation model of the load capacitor should be applied.\n\n\uf0b7 No hand-made inductor (RF block) is necessary. A high-impedance probe can be used to directly acquire the output voltage.\n\n\nIV.5.1.2. Rectifier prototype #2\n\nThe underlying aim of this rectifier is to check if the concept applied for rectifier #1 is reproducible for different RF input target. The objective is to create a load that would cancel out the imaginary part of the diode impedance, but now with a slightly different specification: the RF input target power is -15dBm.\n\nFor this rectifier we have chosen a different Schottky diode, we have selected the HSMS-2850 that is part of the same series of the HSMS-2855. However, the package configuration is different. The HSMS-2850 is a single diode in a package configuration of three leads and the HSMS-2855 is an unconnected pair in a package configuration of four leads.\n\nThe diode parasitic elements values were extracted directly from the manufacturer datasheet. The parasitic elements, C p and L p , are equal to 0.08pF and 2nH, respectively. The diode model with parasitic elements is presented in Fig. IV-   The case study 1 highlights that we need a diode input impedance value for a specific RF input power that is for this rectifier design the input power of -15dBm. The diode input impedance with parasitic elements for the chosen RF input power is Z D (f 0 )=(31-j145.5)\u2126, from Fig. IV-32.\n\nThus, we started the design of the load that cancels out the imaginary part of the diode impedance. The capacitor value was 10pF, but this time an appropriate equivalent circuit model was applied, represented by a capacitor (10pF), a resistor (0.12\u2126) and an inductor (0.16nH) in series. The load resistor value is optimized in order to have the maximum RF-DC conversion, i.e., 2.2k\u2126 for this rectifier. And finally the microstrip line on the same substrate RO4003 has the dimensions of: L=15.65mm and W=2mm. Therefore, the effective dielectric constant is equal to 2.804 and the input impedance (microstrip only) is 47\u2126. As a result, the load input impedance obtained is Z load (f 0 )=1.9+j145\u2126, as described in Fig. IV-33. Notice that the imaginary part of the load impendence is the symmetric of the diode impedance. Next, on the circuit input, I have optimized an impedance matching in order to provide a 50\u2126 matching at 2.45 GHz, as shown in Fig. IV-34. The rectifier prototype #2 that I have fabricated and characterized is presented in Fig. IV-35.   From the measurement results of the rectifier#2, the case study 1 does not rely on a correct assumption. Consequently, we decided to design a prototype #3, with the same Meas concept previously discussed (cancelation of the imaginary impedance part), but now with a different impedance matching process.\n\n\nIV.5.1.3. Rectifier prototype #3\n\nIn the design of rectifier #3 we are interested to cancel out the imaginary part of the impedance seen from the diode input, loaded by an optimized RF load, as described in Fig. IV-37. A numerical parametric assessment was carried out by varying the microstrip line length, seeking for the imaginary part cancelation.    While the results of the rectifiers #2 and #3 were not as efficient as expected, the case study 1\u03bc \"The impedance matching between the diode and the RF load\" seems not to be the correct assumption for the high RF-DC conversion efficiency. Although the rectifier #1 retrieves good results, a latter estimation of the electrical length of the microstrip line @ 2.45 GHz have given a surprising result for \uf062.L=45\u00b0.\n\nFor the design of rectifier #4 and #5, the case study 2 is investigated.\n\n\nIV.5.1.4. Rectifier prototype #4\n\nIn case study 2 the objective was to prove that to achieve a high RF-DC conversion efficiency, we need to design a particular RF load, by creating a phase delay for the fundamental signal f 0 around 45\u00b0 for one-way propagation. Consequently, the f 0 signal is reflected into the diode terminals with a 90\u00b0 delay. As well, for the second harmonic (2f 0 ) the optimal RF load is seen as an open-circuit, thus an important amount of the energy from the 2f 0 will be directly reflected into the diode.\n\nThe first step is to estimate the length of the microstrip line that provides a 45\u00b0 delay at 2.45 GHz. From (IV-13), we deduce that the electrical length of a microstrip line is:\n(IV-16)\nwith the propagation constant, L the line physical length and the phase delay.\n\nFrom a simple equation manipulation ((IV-14) and (IV-16)), we can deduce the length of the physical line that provides a 45\u00b0 phase delay is approximately 0.125 .\n\nAs announced previously, the substrate applied has a dielectric constant of = 3.55 and a height of h=0.813mm. If we assume a microstrip line width of W=2mm for the RF load, then we can calculate the from (IV-11), then the from (IV-15) and finally To complete the load design, I have added a load capacitor of 10pF. The resistor value has been optimized in order to have the maximum RF-DC conversion, i.e., 2.2k\u2126 for this rectifier. Also a slight optimization has been applied on the microstrip line length in order to compensate for the added capacitor. Finally, the dimensions of the microstrip line are L=9mm and W=2mm.     The measurement setup consisted in a Synthesized Signal Generator ANRITSU 68367C that provided the RF input power and allowed the power to be varied. In addition, an isolator provides protection against the reflected energy. By varying the RF input power (P RF ) the DC voltage was measured across the DC load, and then the RF-DC conversion efficiency was estimated.\n\nThe simulated and measured RF-DC conversion and output voltage results are compared in Fig. IV-44. The simulated and measured RF-DC conversion efficiency and output voltage are in good agreement, Fig. IV-44 (a) and (b). A high conversion efficiency of 28% was measured for the RF power target (-15dBm), this result is quite good when compared to the literature results. A state-of-the-art comparison table will be presented in the end of this chapter. Concerning the output voltage, at least 1 V can be achieved from 2dBm RF input power.  \n\n\nIV.5.1.5. Rectifier prototype #5\n\nIn order to confirm that the right assumption was correctly identified, we have decided to design a fifth and last rectifier. Rectifier #5 reproduces the same optimal load design described previously for the rectifier #4, but now we change the initial condition (microstrip line width).\n\nThe line width is 1mm larger than for prototype #4, i.e., W=3mm. Then, we have calculated the from (IV-11), the from (IV-15) and finally we have determined the physical approximated length of the microstrip line, L=8.9mm. The effective dielectric constant is equal to 2.\u03bb08 and the input impedance (microstrip only) is 36\u2126.\n\nWe have added a capacitor of 10pF. The resistor value was optimized in order to have the maximum RF-DC conversion, i.e., 2.2k\u2126 for this rectifier. And a slight optimization was applied on the microstrip line length in order to compensate for the added capacitor. Finally, the final dimensions of the microstrip line are: L=8.7mm and W=3mm.\n\nRegarding the load input impedance for the 2f 0 frequency, we have Z load (2f 0 )=(2674-j3261)\u2126, that characterizes an open circuit impedance. Finally, an impedance matching network was implemented with the purpose of improving the impedance matching at the circuit input for 2.45GHz. The final schema is presented in Fig. IV-46. Even the simulated and measured curves have the same trend, an important reduction of the efficiency conversion is observed on the measurements results compared to the simulation results, Fig. IV-48(a) and (b). A RF-DC conversion efficiency of 18% was measured for the RF power target (-15dBm). This shift on the measurements results could come from a mismatched detect on the measurements of S 11 parameter, as described in Fig. IV-49.  At 2.45 GHz, the reflexion measurement shows a mismatch. On the other hand a good matching appears at 3GHz. At present, we do not know exactly the reason of this issue, but we expect a problem of discontinuity between diodes pad and microstrip line on one end and capacitor-resistor pads at the other end.\n\n\nIV.5.2. Design of the rectennas\n\nIn this section we propose the design of two microstrip rectennas at 2.45GHz. The first rectenna is composed by the rectifier #4 (IV.5.1.4) and the antenna patch array with highorders harmonic-rejection through a 50\u2126 interface. The antenna array design was described in detail in Chapter III (III.3.4). The second rectenna has been developed by a rectifier-antenna co-design. For the rectifier design, the antenna array impedance was taken into account in order to create the impedance matching and on the same time looking for the high-RF-DC conversion efficiency. Both rectenna have been developed with the HSMS-2850 Schottky diode in a single series-mounted configuration.\n\nThe rectifier's electrical schematics for both rectenna have been designed and optimized using the ADS software, but the antenna was designed in CST software. The rectennas have been fabricated and characterized in anechoic chamber for a farfield situation.\n\n\n\uf0b7 Rectenna measurement setup:\n\nSpecial attention should be given to the rectenna measurement setup, since to calculate the RF-DC conversion efficiency, we need to acquire for the same energy density, the RF power on the rectifier input and the output voltage. Interesting methods have been proposed in the literature. For example, a free-space measurement setup using a directional coupler to acquire the transmitted power, and then predict the power density was presented in [233]- [234]. A two-steps system is presented in [57], in which the antenna is placed in a fixed position and the received power is measured. Then, the antenna is replaced by the rectenna in the same position, thus the output voltage is acquired. Finally in [236], a particular rectenna measurement system based on a waveguide \"simulator\" is rapidly presented.\n\nIn this thesis we propose a bi-modal dynamic rectenna measurement setup (Fig.  IV-50.). The measurements have been performed in an anechoic chamber. Tx and Rx circuits are mounted on two axis of movement A 1 and A 2 . The Tx circuit can move in the transmission direction (A 1 axis) and the Rx circuit can execute angular movements (A 2 axis). On the Tx side, the Synthesized Signal Generator ANRITSU 68367C provide the RF signal at 2.45GHz, a coaxial amplifier (ZHL-42W) with a gain of 37dB (15V) at 2.5GHz was used to compensate the free-space path loss and finally a standard horn antenna is employed for transmitting power. On the Rx side, the rectenna is mounted on one mast face, connected to a voltmeter (Digital Multimeter KEITHLEY 2000E) and on the other mast face, a reference patch antenna array is connected to a Single Channel Power Meter (AGILENT E4418B). This method allows to recover a good estimation of the RF input power after the antenna.\n\nFor each rectenna prototype the free-space farfield measurement in anechoic chamber has been carried out. Since we are using a Tx horn antenna which has an uniform distribution corresponding to the side lobe suppression of 13dB [237], the border between the far and near field is calculated as:\n( IV-17 )\nwhere D is the largest antenna dimension.  \n\n\nIV.5.2.1. Rectenna prototype #1\n\nThe first rectenna is composed of the rectifier #4 described previously and the antenna patch array with high-orders harmonic-rejection that was described in Chapter III (III.3.4.1). Both circuits have been developed separately with a 50\u2126 input matching impedance. Then they have been assembled to create the rectenna #1. The rectenna prototype #1 layout is presented in Fig. IV-52 without the lumped elements. In Fig. IV-52 we can identify the patch antenna array then two high-orders harmonicrejection stubs, one for the 4.\u03bbGHz and the second for 7.35GHz. The 50\u2126 interface connects the antenna to the rectifier. An improvement on the voltage output measurement process has been implemented in the rectenna design; from the DC load terminals a highimpedance line brings the DC voltage through a RF-block inductor and consequently the probe voltage can acquire the output voltage. Therefore, the measurements results are less sensible to the measurement probe effect.\n\nThe rectenna #1 has been fabricated and characterized.  A high-RF-DC conversion efficiency of 35% for -15dBm input power is observed. When the input power is decreased to a very-low input power of -30dBm, the rectenna still provides 8% of conversion efficiency. Regarding the output voltage, 0.7V, this can be achieved for a -3dBm RF input power. As highlighted in Chapter I, to smooth the comparison of different sources of energy harvesting, the conversion efficiency should be normalized with respect to the available power density. Fig. IV-55 shows the RF-DC efficiency and the output voltage as a function of the RF power density. As presented in (IV-1), the power density can be calculated from the measured RF input power divided by the effective aperture area of the antenna. The patch antenna array used in these rectennas has a measured gain of 6.7dB (III.3.4). Thus the power density can be estimated and the measurements results of the \n\n\nIV.5.2.2. Rectenna prototype #2\n\nFor the development of the second rectenna, the rectifier was co-designed with the patch antenna array. The aim of this co-design is to reduce the rectenna size. First of all, the patch antenna array has been designed (Chapter III.3.4.2), and then, from simulation results, the antenna input complex impedance was acquired. The rectifier has been designed based on the method described previously for the case study 2, i.e., after the Schottky diode a microstrip line length should be carefully designed in order to present a 90\u00b0 phase delay for the f 0 and an open-circuit behavior for the 2f 0 . antenna impedance at 2.45GHz and to eliminate the second and third high-order harmonics. The rectenna #2 layout is presented in Fig. IV-56.\n\nThe rectenna #2 has been fabricated ( Fig. IV-57) and characterized. Based on the measurement setup presented in Fig. IV-50, the output voltage and RF-DC conversion efficiency of the rectenna #1 were acquired for a RF input power from -40dBm to 0dBm. Fig. IV-58 shows the rectenna measurements results when the Tx and Rx circuits respect the farfield constraint. A high-RF-DC conversion efficiency of 33% for -15dBm input power was observed. When the input power is decreased to a very-low input power of -30dBm, the rectenna still provides 7% of conversion efficiency. Regarding the output voltage, 1 V can be achieved for a 0 dBm RF input power.   \n\n\nIV.6. Conclusion, comparison with the state of the art and perspectives for future work\n\nIn this chapter, we demonstrated a new approach for the design of highly efficient rectifiers and rectennas for very-low-power applications. An optimum RF-DC load is required in order to achieve high RF-DC conversion efficiency. A careful numerical assessment is important with the aim of predicting a correct Schottky diode model with its parasites, as well as the right models for lumped elements. A thorough and accurate rectenna free-space characterization is mandatory, since small errors in the measurements of the received-power/available-power-density or output voltage have a large effect on the RF-DC conversion efficiency results.\n\nIn order to highlight the importance of the RF-DC load, an original method to design a rectifier with the help of Computer Controlled Microwave Tuner (CCMT) was carried out. This method consists in providing different values of the load impedance (capacitive or inductive) at the output terminal of a Schottky diode, preserving the RF-DC conversion efficiency. From the Microwave tuner measurements, a group of optimum load impedances has been identified where the RF-DC conversion efficiency was maximal. Then two possible case studies were put in evidence in order to understand the link between high RF-DC efficiency and these impedance values. Several rectifiers' prototypes have been designed applying the two case studies (subtopic: IV.5.1). Finally, from the rectifiers measurements results, the case study 2 appears as the best assumption, i.e., to improve the RF-DC conversion efficiency, the load should present an open-circuit for the second harmonic (2f 0 ) and a 90\u00b0 phase delay for the fundamental signal (f 0 ). The best rectifier prototype (#4) has been chosen for the rectenna design. Two rectennas have been designed and prototyped (subtopic: IV.5.2). An original free-space rectenna characterization was accomplished in an anechoic chamber, where with the help of two axis of movement the RF received power and output voltage could be measured for the same power density. Further, farfield measurements could be performed due to the second movement axis (boresight direction). \n\n\n134\n\nChapter IV -Wireless Energy Harvesting At 2.45GHz, included in the industrial-scientific-medical (ISM) band, the expected available power density is around \u00b5W/cm 2 level. In [238] the available power density in an indoor WLAN scenario has been presented, following the recommendations of the European Conference on Postal and Telecommunications Administrations (CEPT) [239]; 10\u00b5W/m 2 power density has been detected from 7m of the WLAN router. In [240], a power density of 125\u00b5W/cm 2 (ISM band) was enough to power a wireless sensor, which consumes 1\u00b5A at 2.5V. Recently, E. Falkenstein et al. [56] presented a rectenna which has 44% RF-DC conversion efficiency at 2.45GHz for a 25\u00b5W/cm 2 power density. According to them, the RF-DC efficiency reported in their paper is the highest demonstrated for these power levels. However, we have found two other papers that have reported high-efficiency RF-DC for lower power densities [57] and [62]. Table IV.1 gives an overview of rectennas and rectifiers, including the results obtained in this thesis. It is important to note that due to the multiple efficiency definitions and different prototype technologies existent in the literature, it is quite difficult to compare the efficiency numbers directly. As described in Chapter I, another critical point is the normalization of the RF-DC efficiency as a function of received power or power density. Nevertheless, the results listed in this table have been extracted exactly as they are reported in the literature. For a more clear State-of-the-Art comparison and considering that some papers report the RF-DC efficiency results as a function of the RF incident power (dBm) and others as a function of RF power density (\u00b5W/cm 2 ), we have plotted two graphs for the RF-DC conversion efficiency: Fig. IV-60 (as a function of the RF incident power) and Fig. IV-61 (as a function of the RF power density). It is important to notice that the results (Table  IV.1) which have an incident power upper than 0dBm or a power density upper than 30\u00b5W/cm 2 , are not considered in our comparison, since we focus on the Wireless Energy Harvesting applications (very-low-power available).  Since high-efficiency rectenna has emerged nowadays as an urgent and challengeable issue for low-power RF energy harvesting applications, from state-of-the-art comparison presented in Fig. IV-60 and Fig. IV-61, we can considerer the study reported in this thesis as a pointed attempt in this direction.\n\n\n\uf0b7 Future work:\n\nThe high-efficient rectifiers and rectennas designed in this thesis, can be employed directly in power wireless sensor, where there is no battery needed, i.e., for instant energy utilization and without any need of an embedded power management circuitry. Nevertheless, due to the rectifier's high efficiency values, it should be interesting to integrate this rectifier in an autonomous wireless sensor powered by RF energy, as described in Fig. IV-1. From (IV-7) we demonstrated that the lowest conversion efficiency in a such autonomous sensor is the RF-DC conversion. Thus, we expect that with the results acquired in this thesis we could to improve the State-of-the-Art of the complete low-power energy harvesting systems (rectenna + super-capacitor storage + load).\n\nA second perspective idea comes from the fact that during the rectennas characterization in the anechoic chamber, farfield measurements, but also preliminary nearfield measurements have been performed, since we were interested to uncover the behavior of the rectenna when closer to the RF source. Since nearfield environment needs a special attention on the formulation and analysis, we are taking these first results carefully. Moreover, the different field regions around an antenna are described in Chapter III (III.2.3) For both rectennas (#1 and #2), measurements in a nearfield situation were carried out following the measurement setup presented in Fig. IV-50, and for each output voltage value acquired, the received power was effectively measured by means of the reference antenna. The Tx and Rx antennas were separated by 74cm.   From the rectenna measurements results, an important difference is noticed between the near and far field measurements. Thus, we expect to continue in a future work with the near-field analysis in the purpose of understanding the preliminary results observed. However, in the literature a recent paper seems started to observe the same phenomena in a nearfield zone [241].\n\n\nChapter V -Conclusion and perspectives\n\n\nV.1. Summary of results\n\nDSRC e-toll collection application is a complex and complete system, in which each block should be developed respecting the DSRC standards and practical criteria. Therefore, in this thesis, important DSRC blocks have been developed in order to guarantee the best performance for the whole system.\n\nRegarding the DSRC OBU, since DSRC e-toll system is a broad commercial application, finding references and information about these products is not trivial. Thus, to start our own OBU design, we needed to characterize different DSRC OBU available on the market in order to have access to their electric power consumption. From the measurement results, we observed that the classical DSRC OBUs still demand an important amount of energy per day (4J), this implying a battery life of 4-6 years. Thus, designing a completely autonomous DSRC transponder is not feasible, since the amount of energy required is still high. Nevertheless, reducing the transponder electric power consumption, as a solution to at least double the battery life, could be a good start point to improve environment protection and customer satisfaction. We have proposed a new DSRC transponder with an original statechart that considerably reduces the power consumption. First of all, we have proceeded with the DSRC chip characterization, an evaluation board has been engineered to assist the characterization measurements. We implemented a deep-sleep mode based on a vibration sensor, a mobile evaluation board supplied by a USB port has been engineered. In-situ tests have been performed. Due to this supplementary operational mode, the electric power consumption has been considerably reduced. The new DSRC transponder proposed in this thesis consumes 13x less energy compared to the classical DSRC transponder available on the market, regarding the energy consumption per day.\n\nOnce the electric power consumption of the new DSRC transponder has been considerably reduced, the feasibility of recharging the battery of the OBU by means of Wireless Energy Harvesting (WEH) has been analyzed. From a friendly environmental and economic point of view, finding a solution for the battery replacement and its discard is an important question nowadays. The amount of RF energy that could be harvested by the OBU for the two DSRC e-toll cases (Free-Flow and Stop&Go) was estimated through the RF link budget. Only for the Stop&Go configuration (stop time>2s), the RF energy harvesting could become attractive to power the transponder. A recovered energy of 10\u00b5J could be achieved if the driver spends 2s in the RSE antenna field. Nevertheless, even with the transponder power consumption proposed in this thesis (314mJ), the recovered energy by means of DSRC Wireless Energy Harvesting would not be enough. Based on this analysis, we have decided to explore the Wireless Energy Harvesting for other frequency than the DSRC 5.8GHz frequency. We have chosen the 2.45 GHz as it is part of the ISM band, many authors described their research on WEH for this frequency and we have been able to compare our results with the state of art.\n\nWe have demonstrated a new approach for the design of highly efficient rectifiers and rectennas for very-low-power applications. An optimum RF-DC load is required in order to achieve high RF-DC conversion efficiency. A cautious numerical assessment is important in the aim of predicting a correct Schottky diode model with its parasites, as well as the right models for lumped elements. A thorough and accurate rectenna freespace characterization is mandatory, since small errors in the measurements of the received-power/available-power-density or output voltage have a large effect on the RF-DC conversion efficiency results. With the aim of demonstrating how to achieve high conversion efficiencies values, an original measurement setup was implemented based on a Computer Controlled Microwave Tuner (CCMT), in which different values of the load impedance (capacitive or inductive) have been presented at the output terminal of a Schottky diode. Several rectifiers and rectennas have been designed, fabricated and characterized in order to validate our method. Regarding the rectenna measurement setup, we implemented an appropriate method, since to calculate the RF-DC conversion efficiency, we need to acquire for the same energy density, the RF power at the rectifier input and the output voltage. Finally, the results obtained in this thesis are in the forefront of the State-of-the-Art (45% of RF-DC conversion efficiency) in WEH for very low available power density (5\u00b5W/cm 2 ).\n\nIn the special context of this thesis, at the same time Multitoll Company requires practical and reliable antenna solutions for their applications, but also we aim to further the state of the art through different ideas. We provided therefore, several antennas for DSRC and WEH. The first one is the OBU antenna, a 5.8GHz patch antenna has been designed and good results have been achieved (gain value of 8dB and S 11 value of -18dB). This antenna is integrated with the OBU device produced by Multitoll recently. The second antenna we have studied, fabricated and characterized is the 1x3 patch array with superstrate layers. We have successfully designed this antenna with a high gain (13.8dB) and a small \"visible surface\" (condition requested by Multitoll). Nevertheless, an issue has been detected in the reproducibility of the antenna prototypes due the VIAs connections. Given this, we have decided to use a different feeding method for the next antennas, which should be easy to fabricate in large-scale and presents a lower margin of error between the different fabricated prototypes. The third DSRC antenna developed is based on a patch antenna array with 8 elements and has a special sequential rotation feeding that allowed us to significantly improve the antenna polarization (AR=-1.5dB with radome). Once the antenna PCB design has been realized and since this antenna should be inserted in a real box with DSRC reader, we have studied and optimized the antenna considering the radome and metallic plate (for RF/electronic separation). As described before, these antennas are part of a complete and complex system, and two different in-situ test scenarios have been carried out in order to evaluate the practical antenna performance. Finally, WEH devices need also antennas, since rectennas are a combination of rectifier and antenna, then two rectennas have been designed, fabricated and tested based on microstrip patch antenna array with high-order harmonics rejection. The first rectenna has been directly assembled with the rectifier, however, for the second rectenna a co-design process has been carried out in order to optimize the occupied PCB area.\n\nIn this thesis new results on Wireless Energy Harvesting domain have been successfully reported, but also many research technologies have been transferred and adapted to an industrial application of e-toll under the DSRC protocol. All these work results responded to the company requests.\n\nTo resume, the main contributions of this thesis are:\n\n\uf0b7 To ensure a correct operation of the DSRC e-toll system, each part of the system should be analyzed, designed and tested as a part of a complete and complex system. Therefore, in this thesis, important DSRC blocks have been developed in order to guarantee the best performances for the whole system: o The antennas, both OBU and RSE have been studied, designed and tested in a real DSRC e-toll in-situ scenario.\n\no The OBU front-end design and implementation have been carried out.\n\no A new DSRC OBU deep-sleep mode has been implemented by means of an original wake-up vibration sensor, that allowed a considerable power consumption reduction.\n\no The DSRC V2I link budget modeling for e-toll systems has been successfully developed. Several parameters have been taken into account on the link budget modeling, e.g., car's windshield attenuation, RSE antenna specifications and vehicle speed. In the literature, to the best of our knowledge, only quite few papers explored this topic.\n\n\uf0b7 The possibility to recharge electronic devices remotely by means of microwave energy is quite attractive, therefore in this thesis, the Wireless Energy Harvesting has been studied:\n\no Our work demonstrates that high-efficient rectifier/rectenna for low input power is feasible.\n\no An important effort has been made in order to elucidate in detail how to achieve high efficiencies levels with a single diode and a simple load.\n\no In the aim of demonstrating how to achieve high conversion efficiencies values, an original measurement setup has been implemented based on a Computer Controlled Microwave Tuner (CCMT). Different values of the load impedance (capacitive or inductive) were presented at the output terminal of a Schottky diode.\n\no Several rectifiers and rectennas have been designed, fabricated and characterized in order to validate our method.\n\no Regarding the rectenna measurement setup, we have implemented an appropriate method, since to calculate the RF-DC conversion efficiency, we need to acquire for the same energy density, the RF power on the rectifier input and the output voltage.\n\no A different approach has been provided regarding the difference between Wireless Power Transfer (WPT) and Wireless Energy Harvesting (WEH). Moreover, we have reminded the difficulty to compare the different results in Energy Harvesting literature due to the lack of standardization on the unit of available power density.\n\no Finally, the results obtained in this thesis are in the forefront of the State-of-the-Art of Wireless Energy Harvesting for very low available power density.\n\n\nV.2. Perspectives\n\nDSRC protocol needs complex and reliable RF transactions in order to ensure the payment, as well as the protection of the client's personal information. In this thesis, the high electric power consumption of DSRC protocol has been highlighted. Industrial approaches exist for reducing the electric power consumption of the DSRC protocol (e.g., DSRC OBU completely reflexive, does not need local oscillators to generate the RF wave). However, there is still a lot of work to do in this field. We could imagine the timeline presented in Fig. V-1, where the energy consumption of the DSRC OBU is compared to the energy that could be harvested in the DSRC e-toll scenario. In this thesis, the points A and B have been well established, a new low-power DSRC transponder have been proposed, and as well, the DSRC RF link budget has been carried out, demonstrating the amount of energy that could be harvested in the DSRC band. An important observation is that, as discussed in Chapter I, nowadays, the tendency in advances of integrated low-power circuit technology is the reduction of the required energy by the electronic. Thus, WEH arises in an appropriate time, where the key is to find the point-of-compromise between requested energy and energy harvested from ambient sources (point C in Fig. V-1). However, we could also dream on that one day the point D could be reached by DSRC applications, where a completely autonomous DSRC OBU will be available on the market.\n\nFig. I- 1 .\n1Classical WS diagram illustrating the different power consumption for each operation mode.However, the power consumption for each operation mode, should be observed taking into account the period to accomplish the task,Fig. I-2.\n\nFig\n.

Accounting for the effect of the load to the 2f 0 signal, the load input impedance value is Z load (2f 0 )=(576-j2367) \u2126, i.e., an open-circuit behavior. Thus, we have expected that a major part of the energy of the 2f 0 signal will be reflected into the diode.Finally, I have optimized the impedance matching network in order to provide a good 50 \u2126 matching at 2.45 GHz.
