Although OSS constitutes less than 1% of global software expenditure, it contributes to the reduction of overall expenditure by 25% [55]. While cost cutting is one of the main reasons, many organisations use open source software to increase their productivity and innovation [28].\n\nThe Apache web server and the Linux operating system are two of the most popular OSS projects. The former answers 70% of all Web requests [39]. Whereas Apache and Linux have been highly successful instances of OSS, it has been observed that more than 80% of OSS projects fail [5,8]. This is because a large majority of OSS projects fail because they cannot sustain their development activities [13,7,18]. Development sustainability has been found to significantly influence future user interest in OSS projects [53]. A high level of development sustainability is an indication to community users that a given project is alive, healthy and potentially responsive.\n\nSeveral researchers have studied open source software (e.g. [44,45,46]). Many of these have studied the various factors that drive OSS projects' development sustainability, including developer and user attraction [4], development base and project age [4], having developers with higher levels of different skills [27], project status and activity [53], having a nonmarket sponsor [50], and having a copy-left licence [7]. However, no study has empirically investigated Contents lists available at ScienceDirect journal homepage: www.elsevier.com/locate/infosys the longitudinal effect of its drivers on OSS projects' development sustainability. More specifically, whereas the impact of some project capabilities on OSS development sustainability has been investigated in the current literature, to the best of our knowledge no study has investigated the impact of such relationships over time to see if these relationships change as a project gets older. In response to this gap, our focus herein is on the following questions: \"What project capabilities influence the development sustainability of OSS projects? And does the impact of project capabilities on OSS development sustainability change over time?\".\n\nGiven the current situation regarding the high abandonment rate of OSS projects and also the proliferating reliance of firms on OSS applications [48], seeking answers to these questions is important. In addition to having several research implications, studying project capabilities as potential determinants of OSS project development sustainability is of great practical relevance because project capabilities are, to a great extent, within the control of the OSS project team. Moreover, the answers to these questions can inform potential OSS adopters of the factors that determine the future survival of an OSS project.\n\nThe remainder of this paper is structured as follows. The next section provides some background information, and reviews the literature on OSS development sustainability. Then, the conceptual model and hypotheses are presented. Next, the research methodology is described. Following that, the data analysis and the results of the study are presented. Subsequently, the cross-sectional and longitudinal results are discussed, implications for research and practice are derived, and the research limitations are presented.\n\n\nLiterature review\n\nAs mentioned previously, a large majority of OSS projects fail because they cannot sustain their development activities [13,7,25,19]. Chengalur-Smith et al. [4] define sustainability as \"\u2026 the ability of an organism or an ecosystem to maintain its activity and productivity over time [p. 660]\". In accordance with Chengalur-Smith et al. [4], development sustainability is defined in this study as the ability of an OSS project to show software development activity over time.\n\nVarious researchers have used different terms to represent this concept. This includes \"development sustainability\" (e.g. [4]), \"programme activity in the subsequent period\" (e.g. [53]), \"developers' level of activity in the following period\" (e.g. [38]), \"project survival\" (e.g. [27]) and \"project vitality\" (e.g. [49]).\n\nVarious factors have been reported in previous studies as drivers of OSS projects' development sustainability including developer and user attraction [4], development base and project age [4], having developers with higher levels of different skills [27], project status and activity [53], having a nonmarket sponsor [50], having a copy-left licence [7]. Table 1 shows the studies that have looked into OSS projects' development sustainability and provides key highlights of each study.\n\nIn the existing OSS literature, there are few longitudinal studies that investigate the relationships between OSS sustainability and its antecedents. As an example, Midha [38] collected data at four time points from 156 OSS projects and investigated the potential impact of certain factors (e.g. software complexity and modularity). By collecting data from 8627 OSS projects, gathered each month over a five-year period, Subramaniam et al. [53] examined the impact of some time-dependent predictors (e.g. project status) and some time-invariant predictors (e.g. project licence). Even though the impact of some project capabilities on OSS development sustainability has been investigated in the current literature, to the best of our knowledge no study has investigated the impact of such relationships over time to see if these relationships change as the project gets older.\n\nAlthough OSS success has been studied by several researchers, longitudinal studies on the co-evolution of project success and its antecedents are rare [43], with only the few aforementioned exceptions. Subramaniam et al. [53] state that \"there are no known studies that have Table 1 Prior research on OSS development sustainability.\n\n\nStudy Sample Dependent variable Study highlights\n\nChengalur-Smith et al.

[27] 65,535 projects Project survival, activity Projects with developers who have higher level of different skills are more successful Project survival and activity are determined by the ability of projects to attract users beyond the set of core contributors examined the OSS success from a longitudinal perspective [p. 576]\". Therefore, this study attempts to collect longitudinal data to understand the co-evolution of the predictor variables (i.e. project capabilities) and OSS development sustainability. In order to do this, the researcher collects data from a considerable number of OSS projects over time (at three time points), rather than conducting a cross-sectional study. OSS development follows an incremental design, where a new version of the software is released by incorporating new features into the product or fixing the defects existing in the previous version of the product. Thus this paper focuses on two capabilities of OSS projects, namely defectremoval and functionality-enhancement.\n\nDefect-removal is a process in which one or more inspectors analyse a software system to detect software bugs. A defect can be defined as any deviation from predefined quality properties [34]. Through the defectremoval process, bugs observed in the software are detected and fixed by qualified people with the aim of improving the quality of the software. OSS projects normally handle their defect-removal process through a defect tracking system.\n\nIn the functionality-enhancement process, qualified people augment a software product with features not originally included into the software [41]. The enhancement process, also called \"adding features\" to the software, helps the software team to quickly identify and develop new features to keep them competitive.\n\nOSS projects normally handle their functionalityenhancement process through a feature tracking system.\n\n\nResearch model\n\n\nTheoretical framework\n\nThis Section 1 introduces and justifies the use of a theoretical lens called Dynamic Capability Theory (DCT), which is relevant for studying the impact of the project capabilities under study on OSS projects' positive outcomes. The DCT focuses on the capabilities required for positive outcomes of organisations and has often been applied at a project level (e.g. [2,35]). Next, using the aforementioned theory, this section postulates and proposes a set of hypotheses on the impact of project capabilities of defect-removal, functionality-enhancement and release management on the development sustainability of OSS projects. Dynamic capabilities are defined by Eisenhardt and Martin [12] as \"the firm's processes that use resourcesspecifically the processes to integrate, reconfigure, gain and release resourcesto match and even create market change [P.1107]\". The term \"dynamic\" concerns the ability to renew capabilities to adapt to changing market conditions [54]. \"Capability\" refers to the important role of integrating, building and reconfiguring internal and external resources, skills and expertise to meet the needs of changing market conditions [54]. Among OSS researchers, [16,17] have used the DCT to examine the impact of proactive and efficient defect-removal and proactive and efficient functionality-enhancement on project performance defined by effectiveness and efficiency.\n\n\nJustifying the use of DCT for the OSS environment\n\nAs proposed by the DCT, the characteristics of dynamic capabilities depend on market dynamism. In moderately dynamic markets, \"these capabilities resemble organisational routines that rely on existing knowledge and linear execution to produce predictable outcomes [p. 42]\" [2]. In high-velocity markets, effective dynamic capabilities are simple processes that generate adaptive and unpredictable outputs [12]. Table 2 demonstrates the characteristics of dynamic capabilities suggested by the DCT [12] for organisations working in both moderately dynamic and highvelocity environments, and also compares these characteristics with the characteristics of OSS development environments per se. As shown in Table 2, the characteristics of OSS environments are more similar to those of highvelocity environments than those of moderately dynamic environments. This implies the highly dynamic nature of OSS development environments.\n\n\nHypotheses\n\nThis research studies the defect-removal (and functionality-enhancement) capabilities of OSS projects based on two constructs of defect-removal rate and defect-removal speed (similarly, functionality-enhancement rate and speed). A higher responsiveness to defect reports (i.e. removing a higher proportion of identified defects and faster removal of the defects) indicates a greater defectremoval capability. The defect-removal rate is defined in this study as the extent to which the OSS project accomplishes the removal of identified software defects. The defect-removal speed is defined based on the average time required for an OSS project to remove a defect.\n\nOSS applications follow the evolutionary software development paradigm [40] and evolve incrementally through removing defects, adding functionalities and assuring quality after its initial release. Each defect report that is sent to an OSS project represents a quality need held by its market (i.e. its users). In the defect-removal process, defects that are observed in the software are fixed to improve the quality of the software. Defect-removal is a dynamic capability, because in this process the OSS project developers integrate their diverse skills and expertise to fix software defects, and the way in which this occurs will differ in response to different defects [12]. Thus, the defect-removal rate might have an impact on project success. Given this, we argue that the defect-removal rate can positively impact OSS project success defined by development sustainability (H1a). Fig. 1 shows the research model underlying this paper.\n\nH1a. The greater the rate of defect-removal, the higher the development sustainability.\n\nAccording to the DCT, organisations operating in a highvelocity market face critical time-to-market circumstances, technology changes and hard-to-predict future competition [12]. That is why prior studies have stressed the important role of timely responsiveness and rapid fulfilment of market needs for organisations working in high-velocity markets [2]. Table 2 shows that the OSS environment is a high-velocity market, and also that each defect that is reported to an OSS project represents a quality need held by its market. Therefore, it is critical for an OSS project to rapidly address such needs by developing, integrating and reconfiguring its resources (e.g. programming knowledge, experiences and expertise). Accordingly, in light of the above, we posit that defect-removal speed can positively impact OSS project success, as defined by development sustainability (H1b).  H1b. The greater the speed of defect-removal, the higher the development sustainability.\n\nWhen a software product is enhanced, it is augmented with features that were not originally incorporated [41]. The goal of enhancement is to provide new features to keep the software competitive, which requires that identified features be implemented quickly. Each request for a new feature manifests a need of the OSS project's market (i.e. users). The OSS project should acquire, integrate and use resources (e.g. programming knowledge, skills and competences) to implement that feature. Of course, the precise way in which this is achieved will vary in response to different feature requests [12]. Accordingly, a higher level of functionality-enhancement can be treated as a dynamic capability by which OSS projects can increase their chance of success. In light of the foregoing, we hypothesise that the functionality-enhancement rate is positively associated with OSS project success, as defined by development sustainability (H2a).\n\nH2a. The greater the rate of functionality-enhancement, the higher the development sustainability.\n\nAs discussed earlier, the DCT suggests that organisations working in a high-velocity market encounter critical time-to-market circumstances [12]. This is the reason why researchers have emphasised the significant role of timely responsiveness and rapid fulfilment of market needs for such organisations [2]. As shown in Table 2, OSS development is a high-velocity market, and each feature that is suggested to an OSS project reflects a need held by its market. This being said, rapid fulfilment of such needs is critical for OSS projects. Therefore, given the above, we argue that functionality-enhancement speed is positively associated with an OSS project's development sustainability (H2b).\n\nH2b. The greater the speed of functionality-enhancement, the higher the development sustainability.\n\nRelease frequency is defined as the average number of file releases a project has within a certain period of time. OSS projects release new versions of their application in response to a need held by their market (i.e. their users) to have new changes incorporated into the software. In other words, an OSS project does not generally release a new version of the product unless the team comes to the conclusion that users need it. Release management is a dynamic capability, because in this process the OSS project's developers integrate their diverse skills and expertise to release new versions of the application [12]. Additionally, as discussed earlier, OSS is a high-velocity environment, and it is critical for organisations operating in high-velocity environments to rapidly fulfil their market needs [2]. Accordingly, frequently releasing new versions of the software is important for the success of OSS projects. Therefore, in light of the above, we argue that release frequency is positively associated with OSS project success, defined by development sustainability (H3).\n\nH3. The greater the release frequency, the higher the development sustainability.\n\n\nResearch methodology\n\nSince 1996 some portals have been dedicated to serving open source projects in terms of services such as configuration management, a development repository and communication through mailing lists and forums [3]. Sourceforge.net, Github, Freshmeat.net, OSDir.com and BerliOS.com are examples of such portals. Sourceforge offers a public record of each project's history, including release history, development activities, defect records, feature record, statistics on user activity and so forth; hence, it provides valuable empirical data to be used to examine the hypotheses proposed in this study. Therefore, we chose to collect data from this primary OSS hosting portal.\n\n\nSample selection\n\nSourceforge classifies OSS applications into different clusters. In order to increase the generalisability of the results, we decided to focus on five categories of: communication, security, software development, scientific/engineering, and games and entertainment.\n\nIn order to narrow the sample, we then imposed sampling criteria as follows: we only focused on projects with beta or stable status; we focused on those projects that had used the Sourceforge versioning system, release management tools, and defect-and feature-tracking systems; in order to discard inactive projects, we excluded projects that had not had any file releases within the last 2 years. We also used further sampling criteria (contact the author if you need to know). 1409 projects met our sampling criteria. Table 3 demonstrates some demographic information about our sample. Data was then collected from the selected projects.\n\n\nMeasurement\n\nDevelopment sustainability has a readily available measure: the number of code commits in the next period [7,38,29]. The measure this study uses for development sustainability resembles the measure that prior studies have used to represent project activitythe number of commitswith the difference that we use project activity in the following time period to be able to capture development sustainability. In OSS literature, the percentage of defects removed has frequently been used to measure the defect removal rate of the projects (e.g. [51,52,14,11]). In accordance with these earlier studies, this paper uses the percentage of defects removed to measure the defect-removal rate.\n\nIn OSS literature, the percentage of feature requests completed has frequently been employed to measure the functionality-enhancement rate of the projects (e.g. [51,52,14]). Accordingly, this paper uses the percentage of feature requests completed to operationalise the functionality-enhancement rate.\n\nConsistent with the work of Crowston et al. [9], in order to measure defect-removal speed, the current study will use the average number of days a project has taken to remove a defect. The maximum and the minimum measurements of the indicator \"average time to remove a defect\" for the projects under study were, respectively, 1673.03 and 2.06 days. In order to convert \"average time to remove a defect\" to \"defect-removal speed\", we subtracted the project's average time to remove a defect from the maximum of that (i.e. 1673.03 days) for the projects in the sample [6]. This way, the project with the maximum average time to remove a defect (1673.03 days) acquired the minimum speed, and the fastest project in removing defects (2.06 days) obtained the maximum speed in the sample. A similar process was undertaken to compute the functionality-enhancement speed (we subtracted average time to complete a feature by a given project from the maximum of that (i.e. 2220.21 days) for the projects in the sample).\n\nIn line with prior studies on \"release management\" (e.g. [36,32]), herein we use the average number of file releases a project has within a period of one month to measure \"release frequency\".\n\nThere are some other variables that might have a positive association with OSS project development sustainability, but we treat them as control variables because their potential impact is not the focus of this study. The control variables used in this research include: development status, project audience, project licence and product size.\n\n\nData collection and study timeframe 1\n\nSourceforge shares certain data on project management activity and statistics with the University of Notre Dame (South Bend, Indiana, US) for the purpose of supporting academic and scholarly research on free OSS projects [37]. In order to collect data on the measures of project capabilities, we ran queries against the Sourceforge Research Data Archive (SRDA) and retrieved this information for each project. Data on the measures of development sustainability were directly retrieved from each project's website (development page). Similarly, data on control variables were directly retrieved from each project's website (summary page).\n\nAn OSS project's attributes (e.g. capabilities) impact the users' and developers' perception of the project's legitimacy. Moreover, the OSS project's ability to attract community contribution can be considered as a function of its perceived legitimacy, as this shows how legitimate the OSS project is in the eyes of its audience. However, it takes time for developers to react to their perceptions regarding the legitimacy of the OSS project before providing their support [4]. Therefore, there might be a lagging time between the recognition of an OSS project as legitimate and developers rendering their support to the project. Given the argument above, we argue that development sustainability is a lagging indicator of the project's capabilities.\n\nIn response to the above argument, this paper examines the impacts of a project's capabilities on its future development activities (i.e. its development sustainability). To do so, we needed to collect data in two time snapshots (i.e. t1 and t2). This way, the value for each independent variable is the value found for that variable at t1, but the value for the dependent variable should be computed by subtracting the value of that at t1 from its value at t2 [50]. Given that we were also interested in understanding whether the resulting relationships change over time, we decided to collect data from the sampled projects in three time snapshots (i.e. t1, t2 and t3). This enabled us to examine each hypothesis twice, once for the time period between t1 and t2 (t1, t2) and once more for the period between t2 and t3 (t2, t3). By doing so, we could statistically explore whether the impact of a particular factor has significantly changed over time. Fig. 2 shows the time frame for this study. According to this figure, collecting data in three time snapshots enabled us to examine the research model twice: once for the first time period (Model 1) and once for the second period (Model 2). Model 1 examines the impact of independent variables until t1 (e.g. release frequency until t1) on development sustainability in the period between t1 and t2 (i.e. (t1, t2)). Similarly, Model 2 investigates the effect of independent variables until t2 (e.g. release frequency until t2) on development sustainability in the period between t2 and t3 (i.e. (t2,t3)).\n\n\nCross-sectional results\n\nStructural equation modelling (SEM) is a more powerful alternative to multiple regression analysis. This study employs SEM for the data analysis because unlike regression analysis, the SEM, as a second generation approach, enables the researchers to simultaneously estimate the interrelation between multiple dependent and independent variables [30]. This study uses structural modelling techniques using the AMOS 17.0. In order to compare the relative importance of the predictor variables in impacting the dependent variables, we will use the standardised path coefficients. Standardised path coefficients will be computed using AMOS path analysis.\n\n\nModel fit\n\nThere is no best indicator of model fit in SEM, thus, it is recommended that researchers use multiple fit indices [55]. The following indices form an adequate set of criteria 1 The data set of this study and the data description protocol can be accessed from the web link below: http://research-hub.griffith.edu.au/ individual?extra=true&uri=http%3A%2F%2Fresearch-hub.griffith.edu.au% 2Findividual%2Fn8fe5a4fc978cab41b7c6183a8e017a8d#links.\n\nwhich are recommended in the literature [47]: Goodness of Fit Index (GFI), Adjusted Goodness of Fit Index (AGFI), Comparative Fit Index (CFI), and Standardized Root Mean Square Residual (SRMR). Table 4 summarises all the model fit indices discussed earlier for the research model. According to Table 4, the research model shows a very good fit because all the fit indices have values within the recommended range. GFI and AGFI of 0.998 and 0.992 (respectively) both indicate a good fit for the model because they are in the acceptable range (0.90 rGFI r1, and 0.90rAGFI r1). However, these two measures should not be relied upon too much because they are sensitive to sample size, meaning that they tend to be larger for larger sample sizes, and the sample of this research is large. Rather, we take into account SRMR and CFI because they are less sensitive to the size of the sample than the other fit indices. The CFI of 0.999 and SRMR of 0.005, which are within the recommended range, demonstrate a good fit for the model. The research model explains approximately 38.1% (the R 2 for Model 1 is 0.381) of the variance in development sustainability (the R 2 for Model 2 is 0.437). Table 5 presents the results of data analysis for both time periods of (t1, t2) and (t2, t3). In what follows, we present the results of the hypothesis testing.\n\n\nResults of hypothesis testing\n\nWe proposed that an OSS project's rate of defectremoval will drive development sustainability. The standardised parameter estimated for the effect of the defectremoval rate on development sustainability (H1a) for the first period is 0.19 (t-value \u00bc8.3). This estimated parameter is significant at 0.001. The estimated parameter for the second time period is 0.1 (t-value \u00bc4.6). This estimated parameter is significant at 0.001. As a result, H1a is supported for both time periods. This confirms what we should expect, given dynamic capability theory. The positive impact of the defect-removal rate on development sustainability implies that OSS projects that take the users' quality needs into account are more likely to sustain their development activities in the following period.\n\nH1b posited that the defect-removal speed will drive development sustainability. The standardised parameters estimated for the influence of defect-removal speed on development sustainability (H1b) are \u00c0 0.03 (t-value\u00bc \u00c01.7) for the first period and 0.01 (t-value\u00bc0.73) for the second period. Thus, the impact of defect-removal speed on development sustainability is not found to be significant at any period. As a result, hypothesis H1b is not confirmed for any of the periods.\n\nH2a hypothesised that the functionality-enhancement rate impacts development sustainability. The standardised parameters estimated for the impact of functionalityenhancement rate on development sustainability (H2a) are 0.13 (t-value\u00bc 6.08) for the first period and 0.05 (t-value \u00bc2.5) for the second period. The estimated parameters for H2a are significant at 0.001 and 0.05 for the first and second period, respectively. This confirms the  Hypothesis H2b suggested that functionalityenhancement speed drives development sustainability. The standardised parameters estimated for the effect of functionality-enhancement speed on development sustainability (H2b) are 0.05 (t-value \u00bc2.4) and 0.07 (t-value \u00bc3.5) for the first and second period, respectively. The estimated parameters for H2b are significant at 0.05 and 0.001 for the first and second period, respectively. The findings from H2b suggest that OSS projects that quickly respond to their users' functionality needs are more likely to sustain their development activities in the subsequent period.\n\nH3 hypothesised that the frequency with which new versions of the software are released has a positive effect on development sustainability. The standardised parameters estimated for the influence of release frequency on development sustainability (H3) are 0.12 (t-value \u00bc4.9) and 0.01 (t-value \u00bc0.61) for the first and second period, respectively. The estimated parameter for H3 is significant for the first period. However, it was not found to be significant for the second period. Thus H3 is supported only for the first period. Table 5 shows the standardised path coefficients for each relationship hypothesised in both periods. To find out which impact has significantly changed over time, we ran multi-group analysis using AMOS. In order to do that, we compared the model in period 1 and the model in period 2. The unconstrained model in the first period was treated as the baseline model, and chi-square for this model was taken note of. Subsequently, we imposed equality constraints on each relationship, one at a time, and took a note of the chi-square for the constrained model. The change in chi-square for each relationship was then computed by subtracting the chi-square of the unconstrained model from the chi-square of the constrained model. If this change is higher than 2.71 (because the change in degree of freedom is 1), the change in the parameter estimate for the hypothesis under study is significant at 0.1 level. This value is 3.84 and 6.64 for significance at 0.05 and 0.01 levels. Table 6 shows these calculations for all 5 hypotheses of this study. In the following section, we explain which hypotheses have significantly changed over time.\n\n\nLongitudinal results\n\n\nChange in H1a: defect-removal rate-development sustainability\n\nThe standardised parameters estimated for the effect of the defect-removal rate on development sustainability are 0.19 (t-value \u00bc8.3) and 0.1 (t-value \u00bc4.6) for the first and second periods, respectively. H3a is supported for both time periods; however, the significant change in the chisquare associated with H7c (see Table 5) indicates that the magnitude of the coefficient for the relationship between defect-removal rate and development sustainability has decreased significantly in the second period.\n\nThis decrease is not implausible for four reasons. First of all, as stated by Subramaniam et al. [53], as the project grows old and gets closer to its maturity, core developers may think that \"the software does not need any further improvements and therefore stop paying attention to user feedback [and requests] [p. 582]\", and, as a result, the project exhibits less  development activity. Secondly, at earlier stages of development, the OSS project is smaller in terms of programme size and has more defects and fewer features. The likelihood of finding a defect is higher in earlier stages of development [38]. Therefore, a greater number of defects can be removed and more features can be incorporated into the software, resulting in higher coding activity. On the other hand, as a project gets older and therefore becomes bigger in size, it will have more features with less likelihood of catching a defect. Thus, a smaller number of defects will be removed and a lesser number of features will be implemented, resulting in lower coding activity [38]. Thirdly, the overall level of developers' activity decreases at later stages of development because, by enlarging the programme size, the amount of effort required to comprehend and alter the source code increases. Fourthly, as a project that is in its beta or stable development phases grows old, it gets closer to its maturity. Mature projects have little or no development activity because the software application performs its intended functionality reliably. Thus, as the project gets closer to its maturity, it is natural that the amount of the project's future development activity (development sustainability) declines.\n\n\nChange in H2a: functionality-enhancement ratedevelopment sustainability\n\nThe standardised parameters estimated for the impact of functionality-enhancement rate on development sustainability are 0.13 (t-value\u00bc6.08) and 0.05 (t-value\u00bc2.5) for the first and second periods, respectively. Although H2a is supported for both time periods, the change in the chi-square associated with H2a (see Table 5) is significant at 0.05 level, meaning that the magnitude of the coefficient for the relationship between functionality-enhancement rate and development sustainability has changed significantly in the second period.\n\nThe magnitude of the coefficient for the impact of the functionality-enhancement rate on development sustainability is lower for the second period. Some potential reasons for this drop are the reasons provided in the previous section for the change in the coefficient for H1a.\n\n\nChange in H3: release frequency-development sustainability\n\nThe standardised parameters estimated for the influence of the release frequency on development sustainability are 0.12 (t-value \u00bc4.9) for the first period and 0.01 (t-value \u00bc0.61) for the second period. It can be observed from Table 5 that the change in chi-square value for this relationship is significant at the 0.01 level.\n\nIn the current study, the impact of the release frequency on development sustainability diminished significantly over time. This indicates that as the project grows old, the impact of release frequency on development sustainability significantly weakens or even becomes insignificant. This is conceivable for two reasons. Firstly, as a project that is already in its beta or stable phase grows old, it approaches its maturity, and this implies less future development activity. The natural decrease in project activity as an OSS project gets closer to its maturity could limit the magnitude of any association between development sustainability and its determinants. Secondly, the overall level of development activity falls at later stages of development because as the programme size grows, the effort needed to understand and alter the source code grows as well.\n\n\nDiscussions and conclusion\n\nIT has made significant advances which have had an impact on various aspects of our lives [1,20,56,25]. Numerous studies to date have been conducted on different effects of IT in a wide variety of fields (e.g. [57,15,26,42]). One of the very important streams of such research has been on open source software (e.g. [21,22,23,24]). This paper reports research that investigated the impact of OSS projects' capabilities on their development sustainability over time. The findings of this study and the incremental contribution of this paper to the literature are summarised in Table 7. Next, implications for researchers and practitioners are stated, followed by an account of the limitations of this paper and future work.\n\n\nImplications for research\n\nThe current study applies Dynamic Capability Theory (DCT) through which to investigate the effects of projects' defect-removal, functionality-enhancement and release management capabilities on the development sustainability of OSS projects. This research is one of the first attempts to employ a dynamic capability perspective in the investigation of OSS project sustainability. This made it possible to shed light on specific aspects of OSS development. The DCT extends our theoretical understanding of why a higher rate and speed of defect-removal, a higher rate and speed of functionality-enhancement and a higher frequency of release Table 7 The incremental contribution of the study. The results of this study confirm the expectations from the DCT that, in order to achieve sustainability, projects need to have capabilities that are dynamic, in that they respond to changing market needs. Overall, the current research demonstrates that the dynamic capability perspective can provide great insights into the OSS movement's dynamics. Qualitative studies are now needed to investigate the resources that are necessary for defect-removal, functionality-enhancement and release management, and to discover how OSS projects integrate, develop and reconfigure such resources in order to achieve sustainability.\n\n\nHypothesis Predictor\n\nWhereas the findings of this study are consistent with prior studies that have found a significant impact of project attributes on the sustainability of OSS projects (e.g. [4,50,10]), ours is one of the first studies to demonstrate the persistence of these impacts over time. Subramaniam et al. [53] investigate the relationship between OSS project success and its determinants in a longitudinal fashion; the present research complements their study by including project capabilities.\n\nOne limitation of the vast majority of prior studies that have investigated the impact of project traits and operations on OSS project positive outcomes like sustainability is that they either conducted a cross-sectional study (e.g. [10]) or studied the projects over a short period of time (for example, Hahn et al. [31] studied projects over a twomonth period). Although these studies provide insights on the short-term dynamics of OSS projects, they are less useful in comprehending the success of OSS projects in the long term. By conducting a longitudinal study over a sixteen-month period, this study provides valuable insights into long-term dynamics of OSS project success.\n\n\nImplications for practice\n\nThe result of this research revealed that an OSS project's defect-removal, functionality-enhancement and release management capabilities are important for the sustainability of the project. Defect-removal rate and speed, functionalityenhancement rate and speed, and release frequency are to a very large extent under the control of the OSS project team. Removing a higher percentage of the identified defects, completing a higher percentage of suggested features, quickly removing the identified defects, rapidly completing suggested features and releasing them at a higher rate are the factors that make OSS project teams more likely to succeed.\n\nThe longitudinal findings of this research have important implications for OSS project managers. This study found that as an OSS project becomes older, the magnitude of the impact that the defect-removal rate, functionality-enhancement rate and release frequency have on the project's development sustainability remains significant but becomes slightly weaker. This implies the critical role that the quantity aspects of defect-removal, functionality-enhancement and software release play for the sustainability of the project throughout the project development stages, especially in the earlier stages.\n\nThe findings also help corporations that are about to adopt an OSS project to know the determinants of OSS project sustainability. These corporations need to have a certain level of confidence that the project will not be abandoned in the future, because project abandonment greatly influences the overall ownership cost of the software. The findings demonstrate that a project's defect-removal rate, functionalityenhancement rate and functionality-enhancement speed can assist OSS adopters in predicting its future sustainability.\n\nParticipating in an OSS project that is abandoned after a while is very frustrating for a developer who has voluntarily joined the project. Accordingly, understanding the factors that impact future sustainability of OSS projects is of great practical relevance for the developer community. This study recommends OSS developers to join OSS projects which have higher rates of defect-removal and functionality-enhancement, and respond to feature requests more rapidly, because such projects are less likely to be abandoned in the future. Information on these factors can be retrieved and computed from OSS hosts (e. g. from Sourceforge tracking systems).\n\nWhile OSS applications are typically superior to proprietary software in terms of obtainment cost (because they are often free to download), they often impose high administrative costs, such as security, support and service costs [4]. Project abandonment significantly increases the administrative costs of the OSS application for the adopter organisations. Therefore, the findings of this dissertation that a project's rate of defect-removal and functionalityenhancement, and its functionality-enhancement speed, positively influence its future sustainability could inform potential adopters. To help potential adopters compare OSS applications in order to select a project with a lower likelihood of future abandonment, OSS hosts such as Sourceforge could provide direct statistics regarding the projects' rate of defect-removal as well as its rate and speed of functionality-enhancement.\n\n\nLimitations and future work\n\nGiven the limited time and resources of the researcher, we were not able to collect data at more than 3 time points. One potential extension to this study would be to collect data at more time points over a longer period of time to be able to see further longitudinal effects of the factors under study.\n\nThe longitudinal part of this study was undertaken in an exploratory fashion. One avenue of study for future researchers would be to conduct a confirmatory study on the relationships discussed herein using an appropriate theoretical lens.\n\nAlthough I did my best to identify the capabilities that might be more critical and of practical importance for OSS projects, it should be acknowledged that the list of project capabilities used in this study as antecedents to OSS project sustainability is by no means exhaustive. I consider this limitation acceptable given that my research model explains a significant proportion of the variation in OSS project sustainability. One stream of research for future researchers could be the identification of other project capabilities that may potentially impact OSS project sustainability through interviewing OSS project managers, developers and users.\n\nThe indicators I used to measure defect-removal rate (i.e. percentage of defects removed) and defect-removal speed (i.e. average time to remove a defect) cover the quantity aspect as well as the temporal aspect of defectremoval. However, I did not take into consideration quality aspects of defect-removal (i.e. how well an identified defect is removed). For instance, it is feasible that team developers report a defect as removed when the defect has not been removed in a proper manner. This situation is also the case for functionality-enhancement. While the research design of this study (i.e. a positivist approach by studying a large number of projects) did not make it possible for me to cover quality issues, I hope that future researchers will take into account the quality aspects of defect-removal and functionality-enhancement by a deeper study of one or few OSS projects.\n\nWhile I considered the concept of project capability (e.g. defect-removal or functionality-enhancement), I did not gauge project capability directly; rather, I measured it through the proxy of rate and speed (e.g. defect-removal rate or defect-removal speed), which relate to actions that happen as a result of possessing the capability. I consider this limitation as acceptable because direct measurement of project capability is impossible as it is very subjective. Furthermore, the measures used herein to gauge project capability provide a more objective ground to compare the capabilities of various OSS projects.\n\nThe focus of the present study was on examining the impact of project capabilities until a given period on OSS project sustainability in the subsequent period. However, project sustainability in a given period may, in turn, influence project capabilities in the following period. Thus, one potential extension to this study would be to investigate the impact of project sustainability in a time period on project capabilities in the next period.\n\nFig. 1 .\n1Research model.\n\nFig. 2 .\n2Study time frame.\n\nTable 2\n2Dynamic capabilities and types of environments.Characteristics of dynamic capabilities \nOSS development \n\nModerately dynamic environment \nHigh-velocity environment \n\nMarket \ndefinition \n\nStable industry structure, defined \nboundaries, clear business models, \nidentifiable players, linear and predictable \nchange \n\nAmbiguous industry structure, blurred boundaries, fluid \nbusiness models, ambiguous and shifting players, non-\nlinear and unpredictable change \n\nChanging market \nstructure, indefinite and \nblurred boundaries, \nincomplete \nrequirements, fluid \nbusiness models, \nvoluntary developers \nwith high turnover rate, \nfrequent and \nunpredictable change \nOutcome \nPredictable \nUnpredictable \nUnpredictable software \nreleases \nPattern \nDetailed, analytic routines that rely \nextensively on knowledge \n\nSimple, experiential routines that rely on newly created \nknowledge specific to the situation \n\nInformal and frequent \ncommunication and \ncollaboration, simple \ntools for coordination \nExecution \ndevelopment \n\nLinear \nIterative \nIterative and \nincremental \nStability \nYes \nNo \nNo \nKey to effective \nevolution \n(learning \nmechanisms) \n\nFrequent, nearby variable \nCarefully managed selection \nLearning from ongoing \nchanges and immediate \nfeedback \n\n\nTable 3\n3Project sample characteristics.Percentage of \nprojects \n\nProject age \no3 years \n21% \n3-6 years \n38% \n46 years \n41% \nNumber of downloads \no10,000 \n32.7% \n10,000-20,000 \n13.2% \n20,001-100,000 \n28.1% \n4100,000 \n25.9% \n\n\nTable 4\n4Fit criteria and their recommended values.expectations from dynamic capability theory.
