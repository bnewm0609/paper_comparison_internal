INTRODUCTION\n\nAlthough social networks and their analysis have been around for few decades, they only just recently have become one of the prominent research areas in the field of computer science that attracts more and more scientists and practitioners. This growth is caused by developing technologies that enable to create various Web-based social networks and this in turn resulted in large amount of data that is gathered and ready to analyse without investing much time for questionnaires and surveys to obtain information about relationships among people. Supported by the exponential growth in the processing power, the analysis may be carried out on many large complex networks sharing dynamic properties. This data explosion is very attractive for researchers as they have a chance to test and verify their ideas and theories.\n\nMost of the attempts to analyse the social networks are usually based on the analysis of the binary undirected networks. The reason for that is quite obvious; it is the least problematic and the quickest way to analyse a social network. However, the question which arises is whether the analysis of the same data set, with additionally taking the weight of edges as well as the direction of connections into account, would result in the same results and conclusions? There exist four basic types of networks: binary undirected (BU), binary directed (BD), weighted undirected (WU), and weighted directed (WD) and in this paper all of them will be extracted from the analysed dataset in order to investigate differences and similarities between them. The goal of this exercise is to investigate whether network extraction method influences the results of the analysis and if so, how they can be interpreted. The second dimension of the analysis is to investigate each of the network types mentioned above from two perspectives: local and global as well as to compare and contrast those approaches. Values of different network characteristics are often used to determine a class to which given network is assigned, e.g. power-law node degrees distribution (global measure) means that the network is scale-free but if nodes have high local clustering coefficient then it is small-world network. In this paper, we try to understand (i) what are the differences/similarities (if any) between classifying complex social networks on the basis of their local and/or global structural measures? and (ii) what kind of information can be extracted from the analysis of the global and local structure of social networks and how can it be used in a more complete and accurate network categorisation process?. To gain an insight into and attempt to answer the first question we will apply a comprehensive set of local and global measures to an email-based social network case study while classifying the network using each of the applied measures on their own. For the answer to the second question, one needs to look into the complementary nature of the information provided by the global and local structure of social networks and see if, and if so how, they can be combined in a meaningful manner.\n\nFirst, the paper provides a short overview of networks' global and local structural measures and then the experiments where those measures are used for four types of network (BU, BD, WU, WD) extracted from a single dataset are performed. Together with the experiments, the discussion that will enable to answer above stated questions is then provided.\n\n\nII. NETWORK STRUCTURAL MEASURES\n\n\nA. Global Measures\n\nThe analysis of social networks at a global level deals with studying the outcomes of interactions over large number of actors rather than the interpersonal relations as it is the case for dyads or triads analysis at a local level. It provides the complete view of the network as a whole. Global structural measures, and in particular the node degree distribution, are the most commonly used for classification of networks as described below.\n\n1) Node Degree Distribution: The degree (connectivity) of node v, represented by k v is the total number of connections of this node and is defined as:\nk v i = vj \u2208V e v i v j\nwhere: e vivj \u2212 edge connecting nodes v i and node v j ;\n\nV -set of all vertices in a network.\n\nHowever, when we deal with a directed graph, the node degree would consist of two elements\n-out-degree : k out v i = vj e vivj where e v i v j \u2212 edge from node v i to v j . -in-degree: k in vi = v j e v j v i where: e vj vi \u2212 edge from node v j to v i .\nThe node degree distribution is used in the literature as the main measure to classify networks into the following four categories:\n\n-Random Networks. The maximum and minimum degree distributions in a random graph were first studied in [1] and later the \"full degree distribution\" term was coined in [2]. Random graph is generated as follows: we start with N nodes and connect each pair of nodes with probability p. Created graph has an average of p \u00b7 (|V | \u00b7 (|V | \u2212 1))/2 edges that are randomly distributed [3]. The degree distribution of a random graph is a Poisson distribution. Random network have low clustering coefficient and short paths between nodes, and giant component if the mean node degree < k > is larger than 1.\n\n-Ordered Networks. The concept of ordered network is straightforward. In this model each node has exactly the same number of edges k. They have extremely long paths and very high clustering coefficient [4].\n\n-Small-world Networks. Most nodes in a small-world network are not connected to each other but the distance between any pair of nodes is relatively short (small-world property) as in random networks. On the other hand, the clustering coefficient for such networks is higher than in a random networks. The classic Watts and Strogatz model of small-world network generates structure where node degree distribution follows the Poisson distribution [4]. It is classified as being \"between order and randomness\".\n\n-Scale-free Networks. The degree distribution of scalefree networks follows a power law P (v) \u223c v \u2212\u03b3 , where \u03b3 is a degree exponent (parameter). Values of \u03b3 are normally in the range 2<\u03b3<3. The smaller value of \u03b3 means that the role of hubs in the network is more important. Preferential attachment is one of the approaches to generate scale-free networks with a small number of very well connected nodes and a large number of nodes with low degree [5].\n\nIt should be emphasized, that in the real world small-world networks and scale-free networks are two classes of structures not mutually exclusive. For example, scale-free networks due to the frequency of hubs, can have a small-world property.\n\n2) Shortest Paths: Path length, a.k.a. geodesic distance, is the sum of all edges along a path between two nodes [5]. Shortest path between two nodes is a path such that the sum of the weights of the edges being part of path is minimised. In binary networks all the weights for all edges are equal to 1. Shortest paths can be calculated for both directed and undirected networks.\n\n3) Betweenness Centrality: It counts all the shortest paths from each node to all the other nodes that pass through node v i . This method was introduced in [6] in order to assess the interaction of a chosen node with other nodes within a network. The value of this measure is in the range [0, 1]. It can be represented as the following sum [7]:\nBC v i = v i =v l =v j \u2208V n dv l v j | v i n dv l v j where:\nn d v l v j -the total number of shortest paths from node v l to node v j ; n d v l v j | v i -the total number of shortest paths from node v l to node v j that pass through node v i .\n\n\n4) Density:\n\nThe density of a network may be described as a ratio of the edges which are present in the network over the total number of all possible edges between all pairs of nodes. This measure is used to show how well connected is a network [8], [9]. The density for the undirected graph may be calculated using the formula:\nD und = 2|E|/(|V |(|V | \u2212 1))\nwhere |V | denotes the number of nodes and |E| the number of edges.\n\nOn the other hand, the density of directed graph is calculated using formula:\nD dir = |E|/(|V |(|V | \u2212 1))\nwhere |V | denotes the number of nodes and |E| the number of unique edges. Density is particularly useful if one wishes to compare multiple networks to each other or even to compare different parts of a single network.\n\n\n5) Assortativity:\n\nThe assortativity coefficient is a correlation coefficient (Pearson correlation coefficient) between the degrees of all nodes on two opposite ends of a link. A positive assortativity coefficient indicates that nodes tend to link to other nodes with the same or similar degree [10]. The assortativity coefficient is calculated as follows:\nA = kv i kv j k vi k vj (p kv i kv j \u2212 q kv i q kv j ) \u03c3 2 q\nwhere: p kv i kv j -the joint probability distribution of the remaining degrees of two nodes on either end of a randomly chosen edge; q kv i q kv j -value taken by p kv i kv j in a network with no assortative (od disassortative) mixing; \u03c3 2 q -value achieved on a perfectly assortative network. The assortativity coefficient lies in the range \u22121 \u2264 A \u2264 1.\n\n\n6) Modularity:\n\nThe modularity is a measure used to calculate the degree to which the network may be subdivided into clearly defined groups. The optimal community structure deals with dividing a network into subdivision of modules (clusters/communities) that are non-overlapping. Dividing a network in this way, maximizes the number of within-group connections, and at the same time minimizes the number of across-group connections [11]. The modularity is calculated as follows: Note, that for directed networks, the mutual connections are calculated as two separate connections.\nM = n c i=1 (a c i c i \u2212 b c i ) n c -number of communities a c i c i -is\n\nB. Local Network Analysis\n\nSocial networks are often very large in size and it may be problematic to analyse them as a whole. Local analysis of the social networks, on the other hand, deals with the analysis of the relationships of a single actor, dyads and triads and it is often used as a starting point to other more sophisticated analyses. There are a number of existing local measures out of which we will now shortly introduce two: a) Local Clustering Coefficient; and b) Network Motifs. These two characteristics were selected as they are widely used and it was shown that their analysis can give insight into the global network behaviour and classification [12], [4].\n\n\n1) Local Clustering Coefficient.:\n\nThe clustering coefficient of a node may be defined as a probability of neighbours of that node to be neighbours of each other. In other words it is the probability of the adjacent nodes of a node to be connected [4]. The neighbourhood N vi of node v i may be described as the number of direct neighbours:\nN v i = {v j : e v i v j \u2208 E \u2227 e v j v i \u2208 E}.\nThe local clustering coefficient for undirected graphs can be calculated using the following formula:\nC vi = 2 | {e vj v k } | k vi (k vi \u2212 1) : v j , v k \u2208 N vi , e vj v k \u2208 E\nThe local clustering coefficient for directed graphs is calculated using the following formula:\nC vi = | {e vj v k } | k vi (k vi \u2212 1) : v j , v k \u2208 N vi , e vj v k \u2208 E\nwhere: e vj v k -an edge connecting node v j with node v k ;\nk vi -the degree of node v i ; N v i -set of neighbours of v i .\nFor the weighted networks instead of e v j v k equals to 1 the weight of the connection is used. The value of clustering coefficient is in the range [0, 1].\n\n\n2) Network Motifs:\n\nMotif analysis was first used in bioinformatics to monitor huge networks such as gene networks and food webs [13]. Network motifs are small subgraphs (3 -7 nodes) demonstrating local topology that occur in a given network far more/less often than in a corresponding random network.\n\nTriads are the smallest social structures having the attributes of a society [14]. It is a collection of up to three dyadic relations between actors {v i , v j , v k }. There may be up to 64 connection patterns between three nodes. However, for the sake of clarity only 13 out of those 64 triads (i.e. not taking into account the position of a node in a triple) will be considered.\n\nThe statistical significance of a motif M is defined by its Z-score Z M : \nZ M = n M \u2212 n rand M \u03c3 rand M where: n M -\n\nIII. METHODOLOGY AND CASE STUDY\n\nGiven that this is the first paper looking at the combination of local and global structural measures (applied to directed, undirected, weighted and binary graphs representing social networks) for the purpose of network categorisation task, we have decided to concentrate on a very well known case study as a vehicle for our analysis and discussions. This will facilitate easier interpretation while allowing for reproducibility of our results by interested readers.\n\nThe data that will be used in the experiments is a wellknown Enron dataset. Enron was an American energy company that announced bankruptcy at the end of 2001. The data was made public during the investigation of the company by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. The original Enron dataset contained data from 150 users [15]. After the data cleaning process which involved removing bad data and merging the duplicated entries, the resulting network consisted of 150 nodes (investigated individuals email addresses) and 2149 edges (connections between individuals representing sent emails).\n\nAs a basis for our analysis the following four networks have been created using the above described Enron data set: binary undirected (BU), binary directed (BD), weighted undirected (WU) and weighted directed (WD). Although, term 'network' is used to describe each of the four extracted structures, we should see them rather as four different ways of interpreting one dataset than four different networks.\n\nFor each of the four networks we first calculate the values of all the global and local measures described in Sections II-A and II-B. This is followed by the individual measures analysis and interpretation. The second part of the analysis compares and contrasts local and global measures and provides discussion related to their complementary and contradictory characteristics when attempting to combine both types of measures and four different network types for more accurate and fuller categorisation of the analysed social network.\n\n\nIV. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS\n\nA. Global Network Analysis 1) Degree Distribution: The mean node degree values with their standard deviation are presented in Table I for both directed and undirected networks. Node degree distributions for the directed and undirected networks is presented in Figure 1. Both of these networks follow the Poisson distribution of the node degree. It can be assumed that both directed and undirected networks, in terms of the node degree, behave like random or small-world networks (see Table VII and Table VIII), unlike scale-free networks where degree distribution follows the power-law. Moreover, the standard deviations for the node degree distribution are relatively low and its values are 17 for the directed graph and 12.25 for the undirected graph. However, when indegree and outdegree for undirected network is analysed separately, it can be noticed that both distributions follow rather power law then Poisson distribution. This difference means that in the network the majority of relations are not reciprocated. It shows that different approaches to node degree distribution may lead to different conclusions.  2) Shortest Paths: The values of the average path lengths are small for all four networks (see Table II), and for each network they do not exceed three. It indicates that all the four networks share small-world properties (see Table VII and VIII). Weighted directed and weighted undirected networks were quite difficult to clearly classify and to compare to other networks, as the weight of edges were in a different scale compared to binary networks. In order to get values that may be comparable across all networks it was necessary to normalize the weights in the interval [0, 1] by dividing all weights in a network by maximum weight [16]. The other approach proposed by [17] states that one should normalise the weights by dividing all weights by the average weight in the network. However, for the purpose of this study, the method proposed in [16] was used (see Figure 2).   The study by Howard shows that the six degrees of separation may by true offline, while less than three degrees is more likely in an online social network [18]. Howard's theory proves to be true in case of this study as all of the values of APL do not exceed three.\n\nThe network diameters are 4.43, 3.91, 6 and 4 for WD, WU, BD and BU respectively. This shows that Milgrams' famous six degrees of separation is also applicable to the analysed networks as all nodes within these networks may be reached by the maximum of six steps.\n\n3) Betweenness Centrality: Betweenness centrality may be described as the fraction of all shortest paths in the network that this node is a part of. High value of betweenness centrality means that this node is a part of large number of shortest paths. The plots for all four networks are depicted in Figure 3. The betweenness centrality distribution shows that the mean values and standard deviations are not very informative as it follows power law distribution. The interesting feature may be observed by looking at the maximum and minimum betweenness centrality. The maximum values (for WU -0.453, for WD -0.369, BU -0.127, and BW -0.109) for some of the nodes are high which means that these nodes are taking central places in networks. This also means that by removing these nodes there is a great possibility that certain parts of a network could become isolated from the other parts, thus becoming inaccessible. \n\n\n4) Density:\n\nThe density of a social network may be described as a fraction of connections that exist within a network to all possible connections. It is a measure that can be calculated for both directed and undirected graphs. By looking at the density values it can be said that the matrix is sparse, meaning that the number of non-zero elements is relatively small compared to elements with zero values. The density of a directed graph is only 9% and for undirected graph is higher but still relatively small at 13% (see Table III).\n\n\n5) Assortativity:\n\nThe assortativity is a measure which has a purpose of assessing whether nodes that are linked together have a similar level of degree. It may take values between \u22121 and 1. If assortativity coefficient is equal to 1 it means that the network has perfect assortative mixing patterns, and the network is said to be disassortative, if the value of assortativity coefficient is equal to \u22121.  By looking at the Table IV we can see that indegree/outdegree correlation and indegree/indegree correlation have values slightly higher than 0, with assortativity coefficient values equal to 0.09 and 0.08 respectively. Both correlations have a positive assortativity coefficient so it may be said that nodes with a similar degree tend to link together.\n\nOn the other hand, the degree/degree, outdegree/indegree and outdegree/outdegree correlations have values below 0, with clustering coefficient values equal to \u22120.05, \u22120.07 and \u22120.08 respectively. The assortativity coefficient for those correlations is negative so the nodes with a similar degree will not link together.\n\n\n6) Modularity:\n\nModularity is a statistical measure which is used to assess the number of connections within a community. When the number of within community connections is not greater than the number of connections for a randomly generated network, the maximized modularity takes value M = 0. Values that are closer to M = 1 would indicate that the community structure is strong [19]. In [20] researchers argue that maximised modularity usually falls in the range between 0.3 and 0.7, and also that high values are rather unlikely to occur. It can be seen from Table V that the maximised modularity for both the directed as well as undirected graphs is the same and equal to 0.63. This would also prove the findings of [20], that modularity falls in a 0.3 \u2212 0.7 range. Taking into account that the maximum modularity may reach 1, it can be said that maximised modularity for both networks is high. This means that the degree to which network may be divided into subgroups is also high.\n\nThe optimal community structure for the directed graph is shown in Figure 4 and for the undirected graph in Figure 5. It can be noticed that for directed graph optimal community structure includes more groups with bigger number of members than in the case of undirected graph.   all vertices in the graph [4], [21]. The distribution of clustering coefficient is shown in Figure 8. The clustering coefficient distribution for binary directed as well as binary undirected graphs follows the Poisson distribution. However, for the weighted directed and weighted undirected graphs, the degree follows the power-law distribution (see Figure 6 and Figure 7). The clustering coefficient differs greatly between the different network types (clustering coefficient ranges from 0.02 for the WD up to 0.52 for the BU network; see Table VI). The clustering coefficient for WD and WU may be classified as low, whereas clustering for BD and BU may be classified as medium. What is more, the standard deviations seem to be differing from one another with values ranging from 0.01 for WD network, up to 0.16 for the BU network. Even though the values of the standard deviations are quite different for each network they all have relatively small values. Figure 8 shows the clustering coefficient distribution values for four investigated types of networks. Each plot has been divided into twenty bins of equal size. It can be clearly seen that the most influential factor when comparing the four outcomes would be the weight of connection between nodes. The clustering coefficient for both of the binary networks follows the Poisson distribution. The mean values for BD and BU are 0.42 and 0.52 respectively, and their standard deviations are 0.15 for BD and 0.16 for BU networks. This indicates that the binary networks have small-world properties (see Table VII and Table VIII). In the case of weighted networks the mean values for WD and WU are 0.02 and 0.04 respectively and their standard deviations are 0.01 for WD and 0.02 for WU.\n\nIt appears that both of the binary networks share smallworld properties and the two weighted networks share scalefree properties (see Figure 6 and Figure 7).\n\n\n2) Network Motifs:\n\nThe statistical significance of a network motif is reflected by its Z-score. The Z-score value greater than zero indicates that the particular motif appears in a network more often than in a set of random networks. An email-based social network is directed as well as weighted, however due to limited time and the complexity of the problem in this study we will not be taking the weight of the edges into consideration when performing the motif analysis. Moreover this analysis will only focus on 13 triads (motifs) which all have at least two edges between three nodes.\n\nThe motif analysis was carried out using FANMOD tool that deals with detection of motifs in large networks [22]. It can be seen from the Figure 9 that motifs with IDs: 1,7,8,9,10,11,12,13 are appearing in Enron network more often than in a set of random networks, and motifs with IDs: 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 are appearing less often than in a set of random networks. The results of the analysis of directed connected triads ( Figure 9) have been presented so they can be compared with the results of [23]. It can be clearly seen that TSP of Enron network looks very similar to TSP observed for other social networks and WWW hyper links between Web pages in the www.nd.edu site, recorded and analysed in [23]. The motifs that have edges only between two out of three nodes (open triads) are occurring less often than in a set of random networks. Motif number 1, even though it only has two edges, appears in a network much more often than in a set of random networks. It has the purpose limited to broadcasting the information (eg. departmental e-mails containing the information about the opening hours of departmental office etc). This type of motif exists only in the online social networks and is not found in other real life networks. Motif number 3 is an antimotif -it works as a chain which only forwards the information (also called a cascade or under-represented subgraph). Motif 6 has the lowest Z-score value and is the least appearing motif in a network. This is due to so called 'friend of a friend phenomenon', which states that the friend of my friend will also be my friend (unlike in the motif where communication exists only between two out of three nodes). The opposite of this motif, is motif number 13 ('clique'), where bidirectional communication exists between all three nodes and the motif occurs much more often in this network than in a random network. According to [24] the high positive Z-score of motif 13 and large negative Z-score value of motif 6 could be indicators of small-world properties of social networks.\n\n\nC. Combination and contrasting of local and global measures\n\nEach of the selected and calculated above measures can be used to partially describe the nature of the network. Also, the fact that a network from Enron dataset can be extracted in four different but complementary ways (BU, BD, WU, WD) has its impact on performed analyses and conclusions that can be drawn. In Table VII and VIII a traditional comparison between two measures (i.e. clustering coefficient and average path length), for which values can be analytically calculated for random and ordered networks, are compared with the results obtained from the analyses performed. While availability of the analytical values characterising random and ordered networks helps enormously in interpreting the results in this case such analytical values are not available for the other measures. This makes their interpretation and contribution to overall classification of networks more challenging but, as illustrated below and argued throughout this paper, necessary.   Starting with Table VII and VIII the results suggest that, apart from the clustering coefficient for weighted networks, Enron is a small-world network. Looking further at local characteristics, it can be noticed that in case of motif analysis high frequency of occurrence of fully connected motif 13 and low frequency of occurrence of motif 6 in comparison to random networks suggests that the network is also a smallworld in its nature. This is confirmed by motif analysis on both directed and undirected networks. However, looking in more detail into motif analysis for BD network it can be seen that if there will be triads then most of them will be cliques. Small-world property is also suggested by local clustering coefficient as it equals 0.42 for BD and 0.52 for BU network. This similarity between clustering coefficient for directed and undirected representation of data suggests that the close neighbourhood of a user can be small group of people that reciprocate their relationships. It is very important to notice though that clustering coefficient for weighted networks is very small as it equals 0.02 for WD and 0.04 for WU. This gives an additional insight into analysis that usually is performed only at binary level. It means that although users create cliques in which connections are mutual, their relationships tend to be weak. This conclusion could not be drawn if only one type of network or one measure was considered.\n\nFindings from the local level analysis give an insight into local neighbourhoods but are not able to show how these local communities are connected. Thus, it is important to combine them with the results of global analysis. Local analysis shows that the network has significant community structure. It is confirmed by modularity but should be treated with caution as network density is vary small in both directed (0.09) and undirected (0.13) cases and it means that the network is very sparse. Degree distribution for BD and BU networks suggest small-world network with Poisson distribution. However, when the distribution for BD is split into in-and out-degree then both of them feature power-law characteristic. It means that many of the nodes in the network have relationships that are not reciprocated and at the same time have a small number of relationships. This contrasts with the results arising from the analysis of local topology and at the same time uncovers new information about the network. Combining local analysis with characteristics of node degree distribution, we can conclude that there are small cliques in network and they are loosely connected with each other. Additionally the connection between two cliques is not symmetric. Either communication is one-directional or communication goes 'in' through different nodes than it is coming 'out'. This may be the result of highly hierarchical nature of communication in the Enron company. As presented in Table VII and VIII, average path length for all networks falls between order and randomness and suggests that we have a small-world network with very small average path length. This is typical for online networks. The analysis of betweenness centrality brings in additional interesting information. As it is very low for the whole network, it indicates that vast majority of nodes do not lay on shortest paths. When combined with the previously described results, this is a very interesting finding. It means that although the average path length is small and network consists of many small communities, they are very distributed across the network.\n\n\nV. CONCLUSIONS\n\nThe aim of this paper was to analyse the differences and similarities between the local and the global structures of email-based social networks. The secondary aim was to answer the following question: What kind of information does the global and local structure of social networks provide? Moreover, it was intended to establish whether the information is the same for both the local and the global structure analysis. The analysis was carried out using Enron dataset from which we have created four social networks and respective graphs: binary directed, binary undirected, weighted directed and weighted undirected network.\n\nFrom the analysis performed it can be seen that the local and global structure analyses are giving different results and the classification of the social network based only on the local or the global characteristics may often be misleading. For example, the global analysis revealed that based on a node degree distribution and shortest paths a network would be classified as a small-world. However, if we look at the betweenness centrality and the assortativity, the network could be potentially classified as a scale free network. Similarly with the local analysis, it was revealed that based on the motif analysis one could classify a network as a small-world network. However, using the clustering coefficient it would not be as easy to classify because according to the interpretation of the values for this measure the binary networks have small world properties, while clustering coefficient for weighted networks indicates that they should be classified as random network.\n\nIt can be clearly seen that the analysis at different levels often gives different results especially if we take the weight of the edges into account. This is why it is of a paramount importance to stress the significance of a network analysis at different levels and not to make assumptions based on results achieved from binary undirected networks only as is the most often done in the literature. Findings of this paper may motivate researchers to develop new measures that combine local and global approaches to investigate networks.\n\n\nthe fraction of edges with both end vertices in the same community c i . b c i -is the fraction of edges with at least one end vertex in community c i .\n\n\nfrequency of a motif M in a given network, n rand M -mean deviation of M 's occurrences in random networks, \u03c3 rand M -standard deviation of M 's occurrences in random networks.\n\nFig. 1 .\n1Degree Distribution.\n\nFig. 2 .\n2Shortest paths.\n\nFig. 3 .\n3Betweenness centrality.\n\nFig. 4 .\n4Optimal Community Structure (directed graph).
