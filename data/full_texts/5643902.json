in prospect theory the value of an uncertain outcome is multiplied by a decision weight n(p), which is a monotonic function of p but is not a probability.The weighting function n has the following properties.First, impossible events are discarded, that is, n(0) = 0, and the scale is normalized so that n ( l ) = 1, but the function is not well behaved near the endpoints.Second, for low probabilities n(p) > p , but TO)) + n(lp) 5 1 .Thus low probabilities are overweighted, moderate and high probabilities are underweighted, and the latter effect is more pronounced than the former.Third, n(pq)/n(p) < n(pqv)/nQ?v)for all 0 < y , q , r 5 1 .That is, for any fixed probability ratio q , the ratio of decision weights is closer to unity when the probabilities are low than when they are high, for example, n(.l)/n(.2) > n(.4)/n(.8).A hypothetical weighting function which satisfies these properties is shown in Fig. 2. The major qualitative properties of decision weights can be extended to cases in which the probabilities of outcomes are subjectively assessed rather than explicitly given.In these situations, however, decision weights may also be affected by other characteristics of an event, such as ambiguity or vagueness (Y).\n\nProspect theory, and the scales illustrated in Figs. 1 and 2, should be viewed as an approximate, incomplete, and simplified description of the evaluation of risky prospects.Although the properties of v and n summarize a common pattern of choice, they are not universal: the preferences of some individuals are not well described by an S-shaped value function and a consistent set of decision weights.The simultaneous measurement of values and decision weights involves serious experimental and statistical difficulties (10).\n\nIf n and v were linear throughout, the preference order between options would be independent of the framing of acts, outcomes, or contingencies.Because of the characteristic nonlinearities of n and v, however, different frames can lead to different choices.The following three sections describe reversals of preference caused by variations in the framing of acts, contingencies, and outcomes.The majority choice in decision (i) is risk averse: a riskless prospect is preferred to a risky prospect of equal or greater expected value.In contrast, the majority choice in decision (ii) is risk taking: a risky prospect is preferred to a riskless prospect of equal expected value.This pattern of risk aversion in choices involving gains and risk seeking in choices involving losses is attributable to the properties of v and n .Because the value function is S-shaped, the value associated with a gain of $240 is greater than 24 percent of the value associated with a gain of $1000, and the (negative) value associated with a loss of $750 is smaller than 75 percent of the value associated with a loss of $1000.Thus the shape of the value function contributes to risk aversion in decision (i) and to risk seeking in decision (ii).Moreover, the underweighting of moderate and high probabilities contributes to the relative attractiveness of the sure gain in (i) and to the relative aversiveness of the sure loss in (ii).The same analysis applies to problems 1 and 2.\n\n\nThe Framing of Acts\n\nBecause (i) and (ii) were presented together, the respondents had in effect to choose one prospect from the set: A and C, B and C, A and D, B and D. The most common pattern (A and D) was chosen by 73 percent of respondents, while the least popular pattern (B and C) was chosen by only 3 percent of respondents.However, the combination of B and C is definitely superior to the combination A and D, as is readily seen in problem 4. When the prospects were combined and the dominance of the second option became obvious, all respondents chose the superior option.The popularity of the inferior option in problem 3 implies that this problem was framed as a pair of SCIENCE, VOL.211 separate choices.The respondents apparently failed to entertain the possibility that the conjunction of two seemingly reasonable choices could lead to an untenable result.\n\nThe violations of dominance observed in problem 3 do not disappear in the presence of monetary incentives.A different group of respondents who answered a modified version of problem 3, with real payoffs, produced a similar pattein of choices (11).Other authors have also reported that violations of the rules of rational choice, originally observed in hypothetical questioris, were not eliminated by payoffs ( 12).\n\nWe suspect that nlariy concu~rent decisions in the real world are framed independently, and that the preference order would often be reversed if the decisions were combined.The respondents in problem 3 failed to combine options, although the integration was relatively simple and was encouraged by instructions ( 13).The complexity of practical problems of concurrent decisions, such as portfolio selection, would prevent people from integrating options without computational aids, even if they were inclined to do so.\n\n\nThe Framing of Contingencies\n\nThe following triple of problems illustrates the framing of contingencies.Each problem was presented to a different group of respondents.Each group was told that one participant in ten, preselected at random, would actually be playing for money.Chance events were realized, in the respondents' presence, by drawing a single ball from a bag containing a known proportion of balls of the winning color, and the winners were paid immediately.Let us examine the structure of these problems.First, note that problems 6 and 7 are identical in terms of probabilities and outcomes, because prospect C offers a .25 chance to win $30 and prospect D offers a probability of .25 x .80= .20 to win $45.Consistency therefore requires that the same choice be made in problems 6 and 7. Second, note that problem 6 differs from problem 5 only by the introduction of a preliminary stage.If the second stage of the game is reached, then problem 6 reduces to problem 5; if the game ends at the first stage, the decision does not affect the outcome.Hence there seems to be no reason to make a different choice in problems 5 and 6.By this logical analysis, problem 6 is equivalent to problem 7 on the one hand and problem 5 on the other.The participants, however, responded similarly to problems 5 and 6 but differently to problem 7.This pattern of responses exhibits two phenomena of choice: the certainty effect and the pseudocertainty effect.\n\n'I'he contrast between problenls 5 and 7 illustrates a phenomenon discovered by Allais ( 14), which we have labeled the certainty effect: a reduction of the probability of an outcome by a constant factor has more impact when the outcome was initially certain than when it was merely probable.Prospect theory attributes this effect to the properties of T. It is easy to verify, by applying the equation of prospect theory to problems 5 and 7, that people for whom the value ratio v(30)l v(45) lies between the weight ratios ~( . 2 0 ) / ~( . 2 5 ) will pre-and ~( .8 0 ) / ~( 1 .0 ) fer A to B and F to E, contrary to expected utility theory.Prospect theory does not predict a reversal of preference for every individual in problems 5 and 7.It only requires that an individual who has no preference between A and B prefer F to 6.For group data, the theory predicts the observed directional shift of preference between the two problems.\n\nThe first stage of problem 6 yields the same outcome (no gain) for both acts.Consequently, we propose, people evaluate the options conditionally, as if the second stage had been reached.In this framing, of course, problem 6 reduces to problem 5 .More generally, we suggest that a decision problem is evaluated conditionally when (i) there is a state in which all acts yield the same outcorne, such as failing to reach the second stage of the game in problem 6, and (ii) the stated probabilities of other outcoines are coiiditioiial on the nonoccurrence of this state.\n\nThe striking discrepancy betweell the responses to problems 6 and 7, which are identical in outcomes and probabilities, could be described as a pseudocertainty effect.The prospect yielding $30 is relatively more attractive in problem 6 than in problem 7, as if it had the advantage of certainty.The sense of certainty associated with option C is illusory, however, since the gain is in fact contingent on reaching the second stage of the game (15).\n\nWe have observed the certainty effect in several sets of problems, with outcomes ranging from vacation trips to the loss of human lives.In the negative domain, certainty exaggerates the aversiveness of losses that are certain relative to losses that are merely probable.In a question dealing with the response to an epidemic, for example, most respondents found \"a sure loss of 75 lives\" more aversive than \"80% chance to lose 100 lives\" but preferred \"Im chance to lose 75 lives\" over \"8% chance to lose 100 lives,\" contrary to expected utility theory.\n\nWe also obtained the pseudocertainty effect in several studies where the description of the decision problerris favored conditional evaluation.Pseudocertainty can be induced either by a sequential formulation, as in problem 6, or by the introduction of causal contingencies.In another version of the epidemic problem, for instance, respondents were told that risk to life existed only in the event (probability .lo)that the disease was carried by a particular virus.Two alternative programs were said to yield \"a sure loss of 75 lives\" or \"80% chance to lose 100 lives\" if the critical virus was involved, and no loss of life in the event (probability .90)that the disease was carried by another virus.In effect, the respondents were asked to choose between 10 percent chance of losing 75 lives and 8 percent chance of losing 100 lives, but their preferences were the same as when the choice was between a sure loss of 75 lives and 80 percent chance o f losing 100 lives.A conditional framing was evidently adopted in which the contingency of the noncritical virus was eliminated, giving rise to a pseudocertainty effect.The certainty effect reveals attitudes toward risk that are inconsistent with the axioms o f rational choice, whereas the pseudocertainty effect violates the more fundamental requirement that preferences should be independent of problem description.\n\nMany significant decisions concern actions that reduce or eliminate the probability of a hazard, at some cost.The shape of rr in the range of low probabilities suggests that a protective action which reduces the probability o f a harm from I percent to zero, say, will be valued more highly than an action that reduces the probability o f the same harm from 2 percent to 1 percent.Indeed, probabilistic insurance, which reduces the probability o f loss by half, is judged to be worth less than half the price o f regular insurance that eliminates the risk altogether (3).\n\nIt is often possible to frame protective action in either conditional or unconditional form.For example, an insurance policy that covers fire but not flood could be evaluated either as full protection against the specific risk of fire or as a reduction in the overall probability o f property loss.The preceding analysis suggests that insurance should appear more attractive when it is presented as the elimination o f risk than when it is described as a reduction of risk.P. Slovic, B. Fischhoff, and S. Lichtenstein, in an unpublished study, found that a hypothetical vaccine which reduces the probability o f contracting a disease from .20 to .10 is less attractive i f it is described as effective in half the cases than i f it is presented as fully effective against one o f two (exclusive and equiprobable) virus strains that produce identical symptoms.\n\n\nIn accord with the present analysis o f pseudocertainty, the respondents valued full protection against an identified virus more than probabilistic protection against the disease. The preceding discussion highlights the sharp contrast between lay responses to the reduction and the elimination o f risk. Because no form of protective action can cover all risks to human welfare, all insurance is essentially probabilistic: it reduces but does not eliminate risk. The probabilistic nature of insurance is commonly masked by formulations that emphasize the completeness o f protection against identified harms, but the sense o f security that such formulations\n\nprovide is an illusion of conditional framing.It appears that insurance is bought as protection against worry, not only against risk, and that worry can be manipulated by the labeling of outcomes and by the framing o f contingencies.It is not easy to determine whether people value the elimination o f risk too much or the reduction o f risk too little.The contrasting attitudes to the two forms of protective action, however, are difficult to justify on normative grounds ( 16).\n\n\nThe Framing of Outcomes\n\n\nOutcomes are commonly perceived as positive or negative in relation to a reference outcome that is judged neutral. Variations o f the reference point can therefore determine whether a given outcome is evaluated as a gain or as a loss. Because the value function is generally concave for gains, convex for losses, and steeper for losses than for gains, shifts o f reference can change the value difference between outcomes and thereby reverse the preference order between options (6). Problems 1 and 2 illustrated a preference reversal induced by a shift of reference that transformed gains into losses.\n\nFor another example, consider a person who has spent an afternoon at the race track, has already lost $140, and is considering a $10 bet on a 15 :1 long shot in the last race.This decision can be framed in two ways, which correspond to two natural reference points.I f the status quo is the reference point, the outcomes o f the bet are framed as a gain of $140 and a loss o f $10.On the other hand, it may be more natural to view the present state as a loss of $140, for the betting day, and accordingly frame the last bet as a chance to return to the reference point or to increase the loss to $150.Prospect theory implies that the latter frame will produce more risk seeking than the former.Hence, people who do not adjust their reference point as they lose are expected to take bets that they would normally find unacceptable.This analysis is supported by the observation that bets on long shots are most popular on the last race o f the day (17).\n\nBecause the value function is steeper for losses than for gains, a difference between options will loom larger when it is framed as a disadvantage of one option rather than as an advantage o f the other option.An interesting example o f such an effect in a riskless context has been noted by Thaler (18).In a debate on a proposal to pass to the consumer some of the costs associated with the process-ing of credit-card purchases, representatives of the credit-card industry requested that the price difference be labeled a cash discount rather than a credit-card surcharge.The two labels induce different reference points by implicitly designating as normal reference the higher or the lower o f the two prices.Because losses loom larger than gains, consumers are less willing to accept a surcharge than to forego a discount.A similar effect has been observed in experimental studies o f insurance: the proportion of respondents who preferred a sure loss to a larger probable loss was significantly greater when the former was called an insurance premium (19,20).\n\nThese observations highlight the lability o f reference outcomes, as well as their role in decision-making.In the examples discussed so far, the neutral reference point was identified by the labeling of outcomes.A diversity of factors determine the reference outcome in everyday life.The reference outcome is usually a state to which one has adapted; it is sometimes set by social norms and expectations; it sometimes corresponds to a level of aspiration, which may or may not be realistic.\n\nWe have dealt so far with elementary outcomes, such as gains or losses in a single attribute.In many situations, however, an action gives rise to a compound outcome, which joins a series of changes in a single attribute, such as a sequence of monetary gains and losses, or a set o f concurrent changes in several attributes.To describe the framing and evaluation of compound outcomes, we use the notion of a psychological account, defined as an outcome frame which specifies (i) the set of elementary outcomes that are evaluated jointly and the manner in which they are combined and (ii) a reference outcome that is considered neutral or normal.In the account that is set up for the purchase o f a car, for example, the cost o f the purchase is not treated as a loss nor is the car viewed as a gift.Rather, the transaction as a whole is evaluated as positive, negative, or neutral, depending on such factors as the performance of the car and the price of similar cars in the market.A closely related treatment has been offered by Thaler (18).\n\nWe propose that people generally evaluate acts in terms of a minimal account, which includes only the direct consequences of the act.The minimal account associated with the decision to accept a gamble, for example, includes the money won or lost in that gamble and excludes other assets or the outcome of SCIENCE, VOL.211 previous gambles.People commonly adopt minimal accounts because this mode of framing (i) simplifies evaluation and reduces cognitive strain, (ii) reflects the intuition that consequences should be causally linked to acts, and (iii) matches the properties of hedonic experience, which is more sensitive to desirable and undesirable changes than to steady states.\n\nThere are situations, however, in which the outcomes of an act affect the balance in an account that was previously set up by a related act.In these cases, the decision at hand may be evaluated in terms of a more inclusive account, as in the case of the bettor who views the last race in the context of earlier losses.More generally, a sunk-cost effect arises when a decision is referred to an existing account in which the current balance is negative.Because of the nonlinearities of the evaluation process, the minimal account and a more inclusive one often lead to different choices.\n\nProblems 8 and 9 illustrate another class of situations in which an existing account affects a decision: The marked difference between the responses to problems 8 and 9 is an effect of psychological accounting.We propose that the purchase of a new ticket in problem 9 is entered in the account that was set up by the purchase of the original ticket.In terms of this account, the expense required to see the show is $20, a cost which many of our respondents apparently found excessive.In problem 8, on the other hand, the loss of $10 is not linked specifically to the ticket purchase and its effect on the decision is accordingly slight.\n\nThe following problem, based on examples by Savage (2,p. 103) and Thaler (IN), further illustrates the effect of embedding an option in different accounts.Two versions of this problem were presented to different groups of subjects.One group (N = 93) was given the values that appear in parentheses, and the other group (N = 88) the values shown in brackets.The response to the two versions of problem 10 were markedly different: 68 percent of the respondents were willing to make an extra trip to save $5 on a $15 calculator; only 29 percent were willing to exert the same effort when the price of the calculator was $125.Evidently the respondents do not frame problem 10 in the minimal account, which involves only a benefit of $5 and a cost of some inconvenience.Instead, they evaluate the potential saving in a more inclusive account, which includes the purchase of the calculator but not of the jacket.By the curvature of v , a discount of $5 has a greater impact when the price of the calculator is low than when it is high.\n\nA closely related observation has been reported by Pratt, Wise, and Zeckhauser (21), who found that the variability of the prices at which a given product is sold by different stores is roughly proportional to the mean price of that product.The same pattern was observed for both frequently and infrequently purchased items.Overall, a ratio of 2 : 1 in the mean price of two products is associated with a ratio of 1.86:1 in the standard deviation of the respective quoted prices.If the effort that consumers exert to save each dollar on a purchase, for instance by a phone call, were independent of price, the dispersion of quoted prices should be about the same for all products.In contrast, the data of Pratt et al. (21) are consistent with the hypothesis that consumers hardly exert more effort to save $ I5 on a $150 purchase than to save $5 on a $50 purchase (18).Many readers will recognize the temporary devaluation of money which facilitates extra spending and reduces the significance of small discounts in the context of a large expenditure, such as buying a house or a car.This paradoxical variation in the value of money is incompatible with the standard analysis of consumer behavior.\n\n\nDiscussion\n\nIn this article we have presented a series of demonstrations in which seemingly inconsequential changes in the formulation of choice problems caused significant shifts of preference.The in-consistencies were traced to the interaction of two sets of factors: variations in the framing of acts, contingencies, and outcomes, and the characteristic nonlinearities of values and decision weights.The demonstrated effects are large and systematic, although by no means universal.They occur when the outcomes concern the loss of human lives as well as in choices about money; they are not restricted to hypothetical questions and are not eliminated by monetary incentives.\n\nEarlier we compared the dependence of preferences on frames to the dependence of perceptual appearance on perspective.If while traveling in a mountain range you notice that the apparent relative height of mountain peaks varies with your vantage point, you will conclude that some impressions of relative height must be erroneous, even when you have no access to the correct answer.Similarly, one may discover that the relative attractiveness of options varies when the same decision problem is framed in different ways.Such a discovery will normally lead the decision-maker to reconsider the original preferences, even when there is no simple way to resolve the inconsistency.The susceptibility to perspective effects is of special concern in the domain of decision-making because of the absence of objective standards such as the true height of mountains.\n\nThe metaphor of changing perspective can be applied to other phenomena of choice, in addition to the framing effects with which we have been concerned here (19).The problem of self-control is naturally construed in these terms.The story of Ulysses' request to be bound to the mast of the ship in anticipation of the irresistible temptation of the Sirens' call is often used as a paradigm case (22).In this example of precommitment, an action taken in the present renders inoperative an anticipated future preference.An unusual feature of the problem of intertemporal conflict is that the agent who views a problem from a particular temporal perspective is also aware of the conflicting views that future perspectives will offer.In most other situations, decision-makers are not normally aware of the potential effects of different decision frames on their preferences.\n\nThe perspective metaphor highlights the following aspects of the psychology of choice.Individuals who face a decision problem and have a definite preference (i) might have a different preference in a different framing of the same problem, (ii) are normally unaware of alternative frames and of their potential effects on the relative attractiveness of options, (iii) would wish their preferences to be independent of frame, but (iv) are often uncertain how to resolve detected inconsistencies (23).In some cases (such as problems 3 and 4 and perhaps problems 8 and 9) the advantage of one frame becomes evident once the competing frames are compared, but in other cases (problems 1 and 2 and problems 6 and 7) it is not obvious which preferences should be abandoned.\n\nThese observations do not imply that preference reversals, or other errors of choice or judgment (24), are necessarily irrational.Like other intellectual limitations, disct~ssed by Simon (25) under the heading of \"bounded rationality,\" the practice of acting on the most readily available frame can sometimes be justified by reference to the mental effort required to explore alternative frames and avoid potential inconsistencies.However, we propose that the details of the phenomena described in this article are better explained by prospect theory and by an analysis of framing than by ad hoc appeals to the notion of cost of thinking.\n\nThe present work has been concerned primarily with the descriptive question of how decisions are made, but the psychology of choice is also relevant to the normative question of how decisions ought to be made.In order to avoid the difficult problem of justifying values, the modern theory of rational choice has adopted the coherence of specific preferences as the sole criterion of rationality.This approach enjoins the decisionmaker to resolve inconsistencies but offers no guidance on how to do so.It implicitly assumes that the decision-maker who carefully answers the question \"What do I really want?\" will eventually achieve coherent preferences.However, the susceptibility of preferences to variations of framing raises doubt about the feasibility and adequacy of the coherence criterion.\n\nConsistency is only one aspect of the lay notion of rational behavior.As noted by March (26), the common conception of rationality also requires that preferences or utilities for particular outcomes should be predictive of the experiences of satisfaction or displeasure associated with their occurrence.Thus, a man could be judged irrational either because his preferences are contradictory or because his desires and aversions do not reflect his pleasures and pains.The predictive criterion of rationality can be applied to resolve inconsistent preferences and to improve the quality of decisions.A pre-dictive orientation encourages the decision-maker to focus on future experience and to ask \"What will I feel then?\" rather than \"What do 1want now?\"The former question, when answered with care, can be the more useful guide in dif-ficult decisions.In particular, predictive considerations may be applied to select the decision frame that best rewesents the hedonic experience of outcomes.\n\nFurther complexities arise in the normative analysis because the framing of an action sometimes affects the actual experience of its outcomes.For example, framing outcomes in terms of overall wealth or welfare rather than in tenns of specific gains and losses may attenuate one's emotional response to an occasional loss.Similarly, the experience of a change for the worse may vary if the change is framed as an uncompensated loss or as a cost incurred to achieve some benefit.The framing of acts and outcomes can also reflect the acceptance or rejection of responsibility for particular consequences, and the deliberate manipulation of framing is commonly used as an instrument of selfcontrol ( 22).When framing influences the experience of consequences, the adoption of a decision frame is an ethically significant act.vb)+ r r b ) [v(x) -v(y)l, so that decision weights are not applied to sure outcomes.6.

Fellner, Probability and Prt?fit-A Study qf' !+nomic Behavior Along Boyc>sian Lines (Irw~n, Homewood, Ill., 1965).The scaling of v and rr by pair comparisons requires a large number of observations.The procedure of pricing gambles is more convenient for scaling purposes, but it is subject to a severe anchoring bias: the ordering of gambles by their cash equivalents diverges systematically from the preference order observed in direct comparisons [S.Lichtenstein and P. Slovic, J. Exp.Psychol.89, 46 (1971)l.\n\nA new group of respondents (N = 126) was presented with a modified version of problem 3, in which the outcomes were reduced by a factor of 50.The participants were informed that the gambles would actually be played by tossing a pair of fair coins, that one participant in ten would be selected at random to play the gambles of his o r her choice.To ensure a positive return for the entire set, a third decision, yielding only positive outcomes, was added.These payoff conditions did not alter the pattern of preferences observed in the hypothetical problem: 67 percent of respondents chose prospect A and 86 percent chose prospect D. The dominated combination of A and D was chosen by 60 percent of respondents, and only 6 percent favored the dominant combination of 5 and C. S. Lichtenstein and P. Slovic, J. Exp.
