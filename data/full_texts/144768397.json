In those arguments, stories, statistics, and maps are used to compare various school districts to prove that conditions are indeed unequal. Both sides-plaintiff and defendant-use such information to disprove each other's contentions. In so doing, each assumes that the political spaces of the school districts are absolute, timeless, and independent. Failure to recognize that these spaces-the school districts-are not objective but, in fact, constitutive of the class and race relations actually being argued and debated in court further legitimates local geographies of privilege and deprivation. I examine the formation of the school districts around San Antonio, Texas to illustrate that these districts are far from independent of one another and were formed to isolate privileged communities from the rest of the city. A relational view of space-time allows such spaces as school districts to assume a political role, as opposed to the absolute, independent spaces they now represent.\n\ning system, the state relies primarily on local funds raised largely through local schooldistrict property taxes to finance public education.\n\nTexas and New York are not alone; between 1970 and 2003 forty-four states filed more than 140 cases arguing that unacceptable funding disparities between school districts may violate many constitutional protections (National Education Association 2003). The implicit assumptions about geography are of interest here. In each of these cases, school districts are understood as timeless, independent entities; they are the \"bedrock upon which to rest explanation\" (Barnes 1989,300). Statistics, stories, and maps explain the success and failure of various school districts relative to others. In this way, each school district, whether property rich or property poor, is understood as the source of its own identity, its own problems, and its own solutions; they are absolute spaces and as such exist separate from one another and apart from that which they contain.\n\nSince the 1970s we geographers have begun to reconceptualize space, preferring to understand it theoretically as relational and dynamic, as opposed to absolute and static. We have borrowed heavily from those reconsidering personal identity and the construction of political subjects (Massey 1994(Massey , i995a, i995b, 2005 to inform these new ideas on the production of space and place. Yet while we make theoretical advances, much of our world remains encoded and organized into absolute spaces. School districts are an example of such absolute spaces. Here I introduce and explore a situation in which our intellectual efforts are well ahead of our political abilities. The historical analysis of the creation and maintenance of a series of school districts -the administrative entities that lie at the heart of the education finance debate in the United States-shows how and why these spaces were constructed in particular configurations at particular moments in the past. I suggest that significant connections exist between the conditions under which school districts were formed and concretized and their unequal ability to provide a sound education today. I outline the creation of a particular series of inner-city and suburban school districts in Bexar County, Texas, including the city of San Antonio. Not only do San Antonio, and Texas in general, lead the country in high-school dropout rates, teen pregnancy rates, and unequal academic performance between inner-city and suburban schools, but the series of court cases challenging unequal funding between school districts began in San Antonio in the late 1960s. I make no claim as to the representativeness of this area, but insights gained from the area are useful in elucidating the role of geography in the reproduction of racist and classist social relations. I bring the geographer's alternative conceptualizations of space as formed out of a particular mix of social relationships to an analysis of the creation and configuration of school districts that has led to the education finance crisis and the unequal educational opportunities available to children of color in the United States, most specifically in Texas. listed as intervenors, and 260 school districts are listed as plaintiffs/intervenors ( FOF I-FOF 3). Attorneys for the plaintiffs and intervenors chose five districts from each of these groups of districts to provide a smaller group of \"focus\" or \"representative\" districts (FOF 5). In addition, the state named its own \"focus districts\" in order to highlight the issues it wanted to raise (FOF 5). The distribution of various educational phenomena, including expenses, standardized test scores, and numbers of \"English Language Learners\" per district, were used to argue both for and against equalized funding. The identity of each school district was-and still is-understood as unproblematic, secure, and stable. Each district is presented as an independent entity, replete with its own statistics, its own demographic characteristics, and its own supply of commercial and residential property. This politics of school finance and public education in the United States more generally relies on a conception of school district space as absolute, fixed, immobile, inert, and objective, yet this very essentialist view of the spatial deprives it of politics and \"the possibility of politics\" (Massey 1994,250).\n\n\nCENTERED SUBJECTS, CENTERED SPACES\n\nSince the 1980s geographers have argued fiercely for a relational conception of space to replace an absolute one, one that sees the spatial organization of society as integral to the production of the social and vice versa (Massey i994,4). To make that argument, many have engaged with the critique of the \"centered subject\" debated in postmodern and poststructural theory (Smith 1984;Soja 1989;Keith and Pile 1993;Massey 1994Massey , i995a, i995b, 2005Sibley 1995;Whatmore 1997;Robinson 1999;Drennon 2002). Doreen Massey, for example, works in the manner of Jacques Derrida (1992) (by way of Chantel Mouffe 1995) in her latest work on our inherited conceptualization of space and place (Massey 2005), for it was Derrida (1976, 263) who conducted the most thorough analysis of the centered subject, concluding that the creation of any identity requires the establishment of difference. In selecting one identity above all others, our awareness of any alternatives is suppressed and our attention is forcibly drawn to that selected. Massey (2005) takes this critique of the centered subject-as opposed to one created out of relational difference-and applies it to conceptualizations and rationalizations of place as in her treatment of Tenochtitlan / Mexico City, where one conceptualization of that place forcibly replaced another.\n\nIn a somewhat related analysis of epistemology, Trevor Barnes (1989) drew on the postmodern thinker Richard Rorty to analyze the uncritical use of the labor theory of value and utility in economic geography. Rorty (1979) observed that we in the world are presented with \"brute facts\" and then interpret those brute facts using a framework, or paradigm, in vogue at the time. In this way, people, cultures, or societies separated by time and/or distance may arrive at very different explanations or conclusions when interpreting the same brute facts. To make sense of such differences, \"we must know something about the different contexts in which each [lived]\" (Barnes 1989,301). Rather than accept an explanation as \"truth,\" Rorty urged us to instead investigate how one vocabulary, or one interpretation, acquired its privilege over all others. In failing to recognize the context in which the labor theory of value and utility were formulated, Barnes argued (p. 301) that \"these two essentialist approaches squash flat the play of difference as embodied in place.\" I demonstrate how the absolute spaces of geographical theory and of our political landscape are not unlike the centered subject that Massey has critiqued and the essentialized vocabulary that Barnes examined. I show how one spatial configuration-out of the multitude that could be imagined-was frozen in time and now requires tremendous amounts of energy-in the form of legislation, litigation, and repression-to maintain. Derrida's subject and Rorty's vocabulary-as interpreted by Massey and Barnes, respectively-are the theoretical metaphors for this analysis.\n\nThe large numbers of legal challenges concerning the unequal distribution of resources and of children of different ethnic backgrounds between districts today are being fought based on absolute, essentialized spaces modeled on the centered subject. The identity of each school district is understood as unproblematic, secure, and stable. Each school district is understood as an absolute space, abstracted from time and society, and host to the vagaries of people and events that happen there. Failure to recognize that the districts' spaces themselves are constitutive of the class and race relations argued and debated in court further legitimates local geographies of privilege and deprivation. Alternatives that challenge or undo local geographies of privilege and deprivation must rely on decentered, relative spaces tightly linked to context. I present data from Bexar County, Texas (Figure I), and from the county seat, San Antonio (Figure 21, where the series of education-finance challenges that ultimately reached the U.S. Supreme Court originated (Rodriguez v. San Antonio Independent School District, 337 F. Supp. 280 [W.D. Tex. 1971]), to examine how the production of spaces in the formation of the school districts constituted relations of power that have subsequently been \"inherited, revised, reworked, and bequeathed to subsequent generations\" (Delaney 1993, 49). Objective spaces were constituted through acts of power and exclusion, and they must be maintained through further acts of power and exclusion.\n\n\nOBJECTIVE SPACES CONSTITUTED THROUGH ACTS OF POWER AND EXCLUSION\n\nThe basic system of education in Texas was established in 1884, and, although it has been adjusted, it has not changed significantly. Before that time, parents were permitted to unite and organize themselves into school communities; hence the name \"community schools\" (Eby 1925). The school communities had no geographical boundaries, and the patronage for various schools shifted from year to year. The absence of permanent school-district boundaries was identified in 1879 as a decided weakness of the community system due to the fleeting nature of the schools, many of which formed for a year and were quickly disbanded as families moved (Walker and Casey 1996). The 1884 School Law established local school boards, often the county commissioners, and granted them the power to form school-district boundaries, known as \"common school districts\" (CSDS) (Walker and Casey 1996). The CSDS were then subdivided for the convenience of community schools. The county held the power to create additional school districts, consolidate two or more adja- The laws permitted the formation of independent school districts ( ISDS) in municipalities, which then had the authority to tax property within the district for the maintenance of their schools. The ISDS formed their own school boards, independent of the county commissioners, who led the CSDS. The ISD school boards governed the district, set taxing limits, and assessed property values. The independent districts were not subject to the decisions of the county court, so their borders were  Reynolds and Shelley 1990). Changes from one type of system to the other (from CSD to ISD or vice versa) were effected by local referendum. Unincorporated towns and villages and even neighborhoods of more than 200 people could incorporate for purposes of their schools only. The city of San Antonio formed an ISD concurrent with the boundaries of the city (San Antonio Independent School District, or SAISD). County School Board was in operation, 148 petitions were heard to change the boundaries of school districts, to transfer land from one district to another, to consolidate districts, to divide districts, to reestablish dormant districts, to create new districts, or to abolish districts, indicating the fluidity with which school districts were managed and understood (Bexar County School Board 1902-1962. Some common districts were further subdivided into community schools.\n\nAs the population of the region grew, especially in the first half of the twentieth century, and as areas urbanized, voters often approved measures to convert their CSD into an ISD, thus abstracting it from county control. An increasing market in land subdivision and development may have spurred such a movement, because each ISD is controlled by its own school board, as opposed to being part of the countywide system. Not unlike the home-rule movement,' which Ann Markusen (1984) suggested originated in class conflict and the desire to shelter local tax revenue from the larger municipality, the steady transformation of CSDS organized at the county level into ISDS controlled locally progressed with the formation of new neighborhoods. Like \"class-segregated neighborhoods [that] became the spatial context for classsegregated suburbs\" (Markusen 1984,88), class and ethnically segregated neighborhoods became the context for class and ethnically segregated school districts. Urban growth patterns influenced district formation, and not all districts were created equal.\n\n\nSTRETCHED-OUT SOCIAL RELATIONS, 1900-1930s\n\nSan Antonio was initially settled in 1718 by Spanish immigrants from the Canary Islands or from Mexico who imposed a 6 x 6-mile-square city limit on the landscape, most of which was farming land. The main plaza was to be the starting point for the town, and churches and government buildings shared the plaza border with prominent families. San Fernando Cathedral was the dominant landmark in the space and was surrounded by private property owned by the Trevino, Flores, Salinas, Yturri, Grenados, and Montes families (Arreola 2002,135). By the turn of the twentieth century that private property had been replaced by commercial enterprises owned by the Callaghan, Groesbeeck, Dwyer, and Frost families (p. 135). The conversion of the main plaza from Hispanic to Anglo American dominance is metaphoric for the rest of the city around the turn of the twentieth century.2 The coming of the railroad and of military establishments-first Fort Sam Houston and then Kelly Air Field, Brooks Air Force Base, and Randolph Field-launched a building boom in the late nineteenth century and signaled to Anglos from the midwestern and eastern United States that money could be made in Texas. Between 1880 and 1890 the population of San Antonio grew by almost 5 0 percent, from about 21,000 to 38,000 (City of San Antonio 1973). By 1900 San Antonio's population was more than 53,000, making it the largest city in Texas at that time. As in much of South Texas, and the Southwest generally, as the Anglo populations grew, dual towns developed, separating Mexican American from Anglo American sections of town. A variety of institutional and private forces explored below encouraged such segregation, which ultimately resulted in separate, ethnically homogeneous schools as well.\n\nLegally, school districts were obligated to provide educational opportunities to all children, and they did so in separate facilities. In Texas those facilities included those for \"Anglo\" children, those for \"Colored\" children, and those for \"Spanishspeaking\" children. The segregation of Spanish-speaking children from the others was based not on constitutional or statutory grounds but on local school-board actions and administrative regulations (Range1 and Alcala 1972; San Miguel 1987). The combination of neighborhood segregation and locally autonomous schools made such segregation fairly simple.\n\nBefore 1948 neighborhood segregation was accomplished through the use of real estate restrictions and persuasion. New residential subdivisions built to accommodate a burgeoning population in the early 1900s often adopted restrictive covenants on the value and the sale or rental of property and on the race and ethnicity of prospective buyers (Montejano 1987;Mason 1998), thus spatially sorting the population by wealth and ethnicity. Deed restrictions included those against African Americans, those of African descent, Mexican Americans, those of Mexican descent, various combinations of these, and those allowing \"Caucasian only.\" The latter restriction is an interesting one, for the legal definition of \"Caucasian\" changed periodically. Between 1900 and 1930, those of Mexican descent were officially considered Caucasian by the U.S. Census Bureau (Rodriguez 2000); in 1930 they were classified into their own racial grouping, Mexican, and in 1940 they were reverted back to Caucasian.\n\nIf the federal government was sorting and categorizing people legally in this way, local governments and housing developers were doing so spatially. The Summit Place Company, for example, assured new owners that they offered only the best services in their planned neighborhood north of downtown San Antonio, including \"indispensable sewer . . . ample water service . . . handmade Macadamized streets. . . all utilities.. . deliveries to the rear of your residence.. . wide and properly kept alleys . . . sales of all sites restricted . . . no business houses . . , seven[-]minute car service\" (Bexar Abstract Co. 1918, 61-62). Houses in Summit Place were to cost no less than \"Ten Thousand Dollars\" and were to be \"of brick, rock, or concrete construction,\" and the property was never to be \"leased, sold, demised, or conveyed to, or otherwise become the property of any person other than one of the Caucasian race\" (STCB 1910) (Figures 4 and 5). Subdivisions on the south side of the inner city may have been less expensive-one subdivision advertised houses for ~3,500-but they were equally restricted, warning that \"the said Vendee, its successors and assigns, . . . will not sell or lease said premise to any person not wholly of the Caucasian race\" (STCB 1926) (Figure 6).\n\nPockets of unplanned, unrestricted development usually sprang up between planned neighborhoods. Census records and property titles indicate that these neighborhoods were or could be occupied by Mexican American and African American families, often in service to the Anglo residents close by (Figures 7 and 8).\n\nYet the majority of the Mexican American population lived on the west side of San Antonio, in the area known as the \"Mexican Quarter\" (corrales). The area had FIGS. 4 (above) and 5 (below)-Entranceways to two restricted residential developments built in the 1920s north of San Antonio's inner city. Racial restrictions such as those that were in place in these neighborhoods were found unconstitutional in 1948  FIG. b S a n Antonio neighborhoods in which housing deeds held racially and economically restrictive covenants, lgZO-lg4g. Also shown are the first public-housing units in San Antonio, which were also racially and economically restricted. Sources: STCB various years. (Cartography by the author) FIGS. 7 (above) and 8 (below)-Unrestricted San Antonio neighborhoods situated between the two more highly valued and racially restricted neighborhoods depicted in been predominantly Mexican American for most of the city's history, but with population growth and restrictive covenants in other sections of the city, people of Mexican descent were limited to these unrestricted neighborhoods west of the city's center. Researchers with the WPA described the west side of the city in 1937 (Menefee and Cassmore i940,43): \"In this area of about 4 square miles, almost completely Spanish in its written and spoken language, live at least 65,000 of San Antonio's estimated 100,ooo Mexicans. Here also is one of the most extensive slums to be found in any American city, with decrepit wooden shacks and crowded 'courts' overflowing with Mexican families who are forced by poverty to live there, at rentals as low as 50 cents to a dollar per week.'' In a similar manner, the African American population of San Antonio had been forced into a very few neighborhoods east of the inner city. A random sample of property titles filed in the 1930s and 1940s produces very few neighborhoods that lacked housing restrictions against African Americans, thus limiting that population to a few housing developments predominantly on the east side of town, along the railroad tracks (see Figure 6).\n\nBy 1935 the city of San Antonio was approximately 40 percent Mexican American, 41 percent Anglo American, and 9 percent African American (Home Owners' Loan Corporation 1935, I), and the SAISD was responsible for the education of this ethnically and economically diverse population. The scholastic censuses produced by each school district counted all children aged seven to seventeen and assigned them to age and racial categories. Two lists were made: \"one of negro children and one of white\" (Manuel i930,39). Mexican American and Mexican immigrant children were listed among the \"whites\" but then were further categorized ethnically by their surnames (Manuel 1930). According to the Biennial Report ofthe State Superintendent ofpublic Instruction (Texas Education Agency 1900)~ in 1900 the SAISD comprised 9,266 children of school age, 1,049 (11.3 percent) of whom were considered \"colored.\" Richard Garcia (1991,179) reported that, in i929,56 percent (12,334) of the children enrolled in elementary schools in San Antonio had Spanish surnames. Figure 9 indicates where the \"White,\" \"Colored,\" and \"Mexican\" elementary schools were located in the city in the 1930s and 1940s. Separate junior high and high schools were not available, for few African American and Mexican American students advanced from elementary schooi to the higher grades. The distribution of schools follows the ethnic patterning in the city closely, which in turn follows the maps of racially restrictive covenants in housing developments (see Figure 6). But although the SAISD was forced to provide services to an increasingly diverse urban population and did so in ethnically segregated schools, the CSDS outside the city limits remained sparsely populated until the i94os, when new housing in those districts sparked new neighborhoods to incorporate for the purpose of their school^.^\n\n\nSTRETCHED-OUT SOCIAL RELATIONS AND EARLY SUBURBANIZATION, i93os-1950~\n\nJust as the SAISD provided free public education to children resident within it, albeit in separate schools, so did the CSDS, although they catered to much more homogeneous populations. Throughout the early 1900s the CSDS at the edge of the city comprised few students, but a variety of land-use changes, including the completion of several public-housing developments near the center of the city, and the tremendous investment in military establishments at the edge of town-until 1995 San Antonio was home to five major military establishments-caused significant suburban growth in the i93os, i94os, and 1950s. Residential developments were marked out, platted, and sold according to housing value, thus promoting new class neighborhoods that differentiated the urban housing market-and therefore property values-spatially. Patterns of residential segregation by class repeated themselves continually over the urban landscape, \"marking neighborhoods in fine degrees of differentiation and providing the spatial basis for independent political incorporation\" (Markusen 1984, 88), which here would be the incorporation and consolidation of CSDS into ISDS.\n\nOn the south side of the central business district, outside the city limits, George Harlan was building moderately priced homes that were as restricted as those in Summit Place. Deeds in his subdivisions included the clause that no one could ever \"sell property or any part of it, nor lease same to Mexicans or Negroes\" (STCB 1921). Houses in Harlandale were listed for $1,500 and targeted the white, workingclass population. The Harlandale Common School District became the Harlandale Independent School District in 1923, shortly after the neighborhoods were established.\n\nOn the north side of town, outside the city limits, racially restricted neighborhoods continued to be developed in an exclusive fashion, further sorting the Anglo population by class. Alamo Heights, for instance, was platted throughout the 1920s. Houses there were to cost \"not less than ten thousand and nolioo dollars\" and could not be \"sold or leased to one not of the Caucasian race\" (STCB 1925). In neighboring Olmos Park Estates, \"No residence reasonably worth less than $12,000 shall be erected,\" and \"No part of the Olmos Park Estates shall be sold, given, loaned, rented or leased in whole or in part to any person other than of the Caucasian race excluding bona fide servants of any race\" (State of Texas 1927). The Alamo Heights Independent School District voted itself independent of the countywide system in 1923 and included the developments of Alamo Heights and Olmos Park.\n\nImmediately west of Olmos Park, the same developer built Olmos Park Terrace as a working-class neighborhood where houses sold for $7,o00-$7,500. West of that was the area of town known as \"Los Angeles Heights,\" in which \"any dwelling. . . lying on the West side of the San Antonio and Aransas Pass Railroad Company's right of way shall be of a less reasonable value of ($1,000) One Thousand Dollars [in 1912j and no residences be erected on property lying on East side of said right of way shall be of a less reasonable value of ($1,500) Fifteen Hundred Dollars\" (STCB 1912)-a fine degree of differentiation indeed. The Los Angeles Heights CSD became the Los Angeles Heights ISD in 1923 and then consolidated with the SAISD in 1949. This intensive spatial sorting of the population ultimately produced segregated neighborhoods and, therefore, neighborhood schools seg- regated from one another-and also, in some cases, school districts segregated from one another.\n\n\nEthnic Assignments in the Elementary\n\nThose precluded by race or class from settling in the new housing developments on the outskirts of town were subject to additional forces that led many to move west of the city. In 1940 the U.S. Air Force expanded Kelly Field (and, in 1948, renamed it \"Kelly Air Force Base\") as part of a nationwide defense program and began hiring to build the new facilities. Although Mexican Americans were excluded from working in the fields of airplane and engine repair (Montejano 1987,268), jobs on the military bases continued to attract a wide population. Housing around the bases reflected and reinforced the social divisions already in place. Affordable housing was heavily restricted, while even lower-priced, unrestricted housing of lower quality cropped up nearby. The South San Antonio Independent School District, formed in 1922, encircled the restricted neighborhoods around Kelly Field.\n\nIn 1939-1940 the San Antonio Housing Authority began the construction of Alazan-Apache Courts, one of the oldest public-housing complexes in the United States. Built on the site of the former corrales, Alazan-Apache Courts displaced nearly 200 Mexican American families (SAHA 1940; Johnson 1974). Many of those families moved to the western edge of the city, where land and housing were not restricted, into the suburban area known as \"Edgewood.\" The area had previously been home to Belgian farmers, who began to sell their property in the 1930s to housing developers who, in turn, platted narrow, 25 x loo-foot lots that sold for $200. A \"Mexican\" school had been built in 1933 for the few Mexican families that resided in the area. The Edgewood Common School District served the children in this area as part of the countywide system. By 1935, when the WPA project received approval to conduct a study the researchers described as \"a statistical and research study of the Texas public school situation with particular attention . . . to the efficiency of the existing organization of the administrative units\" (TSBE 1937, v), Bexar County contained fifty-six CSDS and eight ISDS. The SAISD was administering to a population that was about 40 percent Mexican American and 45 percent Anglo American in separate, ethnically homogeneous schools. The surrounding CSDS and ISDS were home to overwhelmingly homogenous populations, both ethnically and economically, for the reasons presented above. This landscape of stretched-out racial and class relations concretized as the inner-suburban CSDS voted themselves independent of the countywide system ( Figure 10). In this way, schools and school districts could cater to these highly differentiated neighborhoods, thus affirming and reproducing the class-differentiated landscape. All of the earliest districts to vote themselves independent of the countywide system were ones in which substantial residential development was taking place and where various restrictions sorted the population by both ethnic group and income. Rural areas and those areas developing more haphazardly remained CSDS.\n\nIndependent status removed a district from the countywide system and allowed only those residing in the newly delineated space to vote for members of the school board. Property-tax dollars received after independence flowed to local coffers rather than to shared, countywide needs. In 1948 an independent committee on education in Texas recommended that all remaining CSDS in the state be consolidated and have the status of the ('present independent school districts\" (Gilmer-Aiken Committee 1948, 24). A flurry of consolidations followed, as nine common districts in the northwest part of the county consolidated to form the Northside Common District, then consolidated with three additional districts to form the Northside Independent School District. In the northeastern section of the county, seven CSDS consolidated to form the Northeast Rural High School District, then consolidated again. The East Central Rural High School District was formed from six southeastern CSDS, and the Judson Rural High School District was formed from three other east-side CSDS in 1948. Districts also consolidated on the south and southwest sides of the city to form the Southwest ISD and the Southside ISD (see Figure I). The SAISD annexed three common school districts in this movement: the Hot Wells CSD, to the east; the W. W. White CSD, also to the east; and Los Angeles Heights, until then an ISD to the northwest).\n\nBy early 1950 the Edgewood Common School District, to the west of the inner city, was the only remaining inner-suburban school district that had not voted itself independent of the countywide system and had not been annexed or consolidated with any other district. Although the Edgewood neighborhood had been annexed by the city of San Antonio in the early i94os, two separate school districts were maintained. By that time, property values in Edgewood were the lowest in the metropolitan area due to decades of housing restrictions and other barriers in the rest of the city that effectively pushed the poorer population westward into Edgewood. There, land development companies had subdivided irrigated farmlands into substandard-sized plots that lacked any physical infrastructure. Tax revenues were the lowest in the county. At a November school-board meeting in 1949 the superintendent of the Edgewood CSD proposed to the County School Board that the district vote to make itself independent, because ISDS could raise more property taxes and apply for additional state monies that were not available to common districts.\n\nHe pointed out to the school board that \"the other alternative . . . [was] to join SAISD,\" that formal application to join the other city school district had already been made, but that \"obviously the city district did not wish to take the Edgewood District,\" because no reply had been received (Edgewood Independent School Board 1949, 8 November).\n\nOn 21 January 1950 Edgewood voted itself an ISD. By 1953 its superintendent was again inquiring into consolidation with the SAISD, and, by 1954, the Edgewood district was in financial crisis (Table I). Due to the district's inability to fund new infrastructure, 167 classes were on a half-day schedule, and it was predicted that the number would grow to more than 200 by the end of that calendar year. In April 1955 the superintendent reported that the S A I S D school board recognized its \"moral obligation to annex the Edgewood District\" (Edgewood Independent School Board 1955, 15 April) but that the law did not compel them to do so. Despite continual correspondence, SAISD never annexed the Edgewood ISD, even though it had an-nexed the Los Angeles Heights, W. W. White, and Hot Wells districts less than five years earlier (SAISB 1952(SAISB -1954 (see Table I).\n\nThe creation of ISDS insulated local funds from wider urban needs. Since 1920, constitutional tax limits on school districts had been abolished and made a local prerogative, thus widening local disparity because of varying ability and willingness to tax oneself (Walker and Casey 1996). Following the consolidations of CSDS in the late 1940s and early 1950s, legislation was passed that protected the more  1953-1954. affluent areas from taking on the burden of their poorer neighboring districts through consolidation. That legislation was amended most recently in 2003, and consolidation now requires public inspections, public hearings, and a general referendum. Although only Alamo Heights incorporated as a separate and independent municipal government, the various school districts divide the county effectively into eighteen different economically and ethnically segregated spaces (see Figure 1). It takes tremendous energy to maintain essentialized spaces frozen in time. Since the early 1960s that tremendous energy has materialized in the form of litigation and legislation.\n\n\nTAHLE I-ASSESSED PROPERTY VALUATION PER S T U D E N T IN SELECTED I N D E P E N D E N T SCHOOL DISTRICTS I N SAN A N T O N I O , T E X A S\n\n\nSource: Texas Education Agency\n\n\nOBJECTIVE SPACES MAINTAINED THROUGH ACTS OF POWER A N D EXCLUSION\n\nIn the 1960s awareness of the inequalities among school districts grew in San Antonio-and in Texas more generally. In 1968 the Governor's Committee on Public School Education issued A Tale of Two Districts, in which an inner-city school district and a neighboring, wealthy suburban school district were compared (Figures 11 and 12). The two districts were always anonymous, but it is well known that they were modeled on Edgewood and Alamo Heights. The committee's findings are summarized in Table 11. Despite the startling differences between the two districts, the poorer of the two was taxing itself $1.05 per $100 of assessed property value, whereas the other taxed itself $0.85 per $100 of assessed value. The presentation of data-charts and maps displaying the characteristics of each school district-indicates the degree to which administrators, lawmakers, and the general public had 586 THE GEOGRAPHICAL REVIEW\n\n\nFIGS. 11 and 12-An inner-city high school (above) and a suburban high school (below) within the city limits of San Antonio, Texas. (Photographs by the author, summer 2006)\n\n\nSAN ANTONIO S C H O O L DISTRICTS\n\n\n587\n\ncome to understand the districts as separate, independent entities with histories and geographies all their own.\n\nIn 1969, parents of students in the Edgewood District formed the Edgewood Concerned Parents Association. Together with five additional school districts in the county, they filed a suit, San Antonio Independent School District v. Rodriguez,411 U. S. 1 (1973). Two central concerns were highlighted in the suit: the deplorable financial situation in which the district found itself relative to neighboring school districts, and the extreme fragmentation of the districts. In 1971, a three-judge federal court panel (5th Circuit) in San Antonio found the Texas system of school finance unconstitutional because it violated the Fourteenth Amendment (Rodriguez v. San Antonio Independent School District). The case was argued around the discrepancy between education in wealthy and poor school districts, noting that children in poor districts were denied an equal education because of their lack of wealth; poverty was identified as a suspect category-one to which the courts must apply strict scrutiny (Figure 13). The state of Texas was given two years in which to address the inadequacies. While special panels and working groups were being formed, the case was appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court.\n\nOn 21 March 1973 the U.S. Supreme Court reversed San Antonio Independent School District v. Rodriguez, finding that wealth is not a suspect category that deserved strict scrutiny, that poor children do not necessarily live in poor places, and that education is not a protected right under the U.S. Constitution. The decision was a rancorous one (5-4), and Justice Thurgood Marshall wrote a scathing dissent that is still quoted frequently. With this ruling, education finance has been eliminated from the federal docket and is argued and debated in each state's unique context.\n\nFor the next twelve years, from 1973 to 1985, the Texas legislature made feeble attempts to remedy the growing disparities between property-rich and propertypoor school districts. Special commissions, expert panels, and the Texas billionaire and businessman Ross Perot were all commissioned to find alternatives to the funding scheme. The alternatives they posed included subtle adjustments to the existing state's foundation program that allocated funds to school districts based on atten- dance. None of these alternatives alleviated the tremendous inequities due primarily to the uneven distribution of property wealth.\n\nAfter fourteen years, with growing discrepancies, a coalition of parents, school districts, proponents of school finance reform, and the Mexican American Legal and Education Defense Fund (MALDEF) filed a second lawsuit against the state of Texas, Edgewood Independent School District v. Kirby, No. 362, 516 (259th Dist. Ct., Travis County, Tex. (1987)). The class-action suit claimed that the Texas system of education deprives more than 1 million children in property-poor districts of their right to an equal education. On 29 April 1987 the Texas system of school finance was once again found to be unconstitutional. The finding was immediately appealed, reversed, and appealed once again to the State Supreme Court, where it was reaffirmed (Edgewood Independent School District v. William Kirby et al., 777 S.W.2d 391 [Tex. 19891). One of the findings of the court was that, \"In the creation and development of school district boundaries, the legislature did not follow any rational or articulated policy. Neither in their creation nor in their perpetuation has an effort been made to equalize the districts' local tax bases. There is no underlying rationale in the boundaries of many school districts, and many are pure tax havens\" (William Kirby v. Edgewood Independent School District, 761 S.W.2d 859, 868 [Tex. Ct. App. 1988)). School districts had effectively been completely abstracted from the social relations that had produced them. The other findings of the court included the tremendous inequalities in funding, the inability of the poorer districts to raise funds above and beyond the state's foundation program, and the clustering of minority students in property-poor districts. For the scholastic year 1988-1989 the Texas Education Agency (1989,6) reported that the property value per student in the 95 percent Mexican American Edgewood ISD was $32,046 but that, in the more than 90 percent Anglo American Alamo Heights ISD, it was $510,822. The decision was appealed, reversed, and appealed again in 1989, at which time the court instructed the legislature to fix the system within two years.\n\nEven though scores of ideas were put forward, and some lauded, including the formation of a countywide education taxing authority, the basic problem remained: The Texas school-financing system was deemed unconstitutional because of the inequitable distribution of property wealth among school districts, yet the districts were understood as equal and independent of each other-as absolute, essentialized, natural spaces removed from the political realm and from the highly contested historical geographies that went into their making. In 1992 the Texas legislature put in place the recapture system known as \"Robin Hood,\" which redistributes excess funds from property-rich school districts to property-poor ones. Despite the efforts made to equalize funding, a $6oo-per-student funding gap between property-rich and property-poor districts was allowed. By 2004 the funding gap had grown to $1,100 per student, and districts were back in court (West Orange-Cove Consolidated I.S.D. v. Felipe Alanis, 107 S.W.3d 558 [Tex. 20031).\n\nThirty years of litigation and legislation between rich and poor over the spatial distribution of funds is the violence that Derrida stated is necessary to maintain 590 THE GEOGRAPHICAL REVIEW separation and independence between otherwise relational entities. Many agree that the original Rodriguez case was lost in the Supreme Court because the attorneys for the plaintiffs argued that wealth was a suspect category-a thorny issue in the United States. But the finding in the four Edgewood cases that the creation and development of school-district boundaries, and thus the formation of the districts themselves, did not follow any \"rational or articulated\" (William Kirby v. Edgewood Independent School District, 761 S.W.2d 859, 868 [Tex. Ct. App. 19881) policy is the assumption I challenge here. In finding that the districts were not created according to any system of order, it is easy to understand each as separate and independent of all others-as absolute spaces, as independent entities, as created in an original position under a veil of ignorance (Rawls i97i)-and, therefore, to treat them as independent of each other and dependent only on locally generated resources. By denying context, \"the landscapes created are closed; they are sealed against change and diversity. In short, they kill the conversation\" (Barnes 1989, 301). The landscape of school districts, and thus of the delivery of public education, was closed in Texas in the 1950s following the flurry of school-district consolidations. Further adjustments to school-district boundaries have not been made, although modification of the boundaries is an option a district may elect to satisfy the \"Robin Hood\" laws. Change and diversity are precluded in the \"new\"-postconsolidation-landscape, because the social conditions of the time were frozen spatially. Upon closer examination, it becomes obvious that a very clear and articulated policy was in fact behind the formation of these districts; they are envelopes of a particular space-time that was characterized by highly discriminatory ethnic and class relations and neighborhood development that produced a fractured and fragmented landscape of property values. Looking into the formation of the districts themselves allows us to better understand the relational context in which they were created and thus argue that no one district can be understood or financed independent of any other. THE GEOGRAPHER'S CQNTRIBUTION TO RECONCEPTUALIZING SPACES According to Samuel Bowles and Herbert Gintis in Schooling in Capitalist America (1976,102), \"the pattern of economic inequality [in American society] is predominantly 'set' in the economy itself-via market and property institutions which dictate wide inequalities in income from property,\" which in turn dictate wide inequalities in school funding. Rather than helping us realize egalitarian objectives, our educational system legitimates preexisting economic disparities. One of the ways it does that is through its use of space. Ongoing litigation across the United States aims to alleviate the fiscal imbalances among school districts: leveling out the playing field to give each student an equal chance. Yet even those who are working to equaIize funding among school districts, including organizations such as the Mexican American Legal and Education Defense Fund ( MALDEF) and the Campaign for Fiscal Equity (CFE), understand the districts as independent spaces with personalities and problems of their own and of their own making. They offer solutions such as tax redistribution from wealthy districts to poor ones to equalize per-pupil spending amounts. David Harvey (1973,136) would label these solutions \"liberal\" because \"they recognize inequity but seek to cure that inequity within an existing set of social mechanisms. How can we identify more revolutionary solutions?\" He urges us to \"eliminate the conditions which give rise to the truth of the theory'' (p. 137). Massey (2005) and Barnes (1989) offer the reconceptualizations needed to envision the solutions Harvey calls for. The case study presented here fits empirical data into their reconceptualizations, in a manner reminiscent of Rorty's (1979) urging to investigate how one interpretation-in this case, one spatial configurationgained privilege over all others and for all time. The liberal alternative to unequal educational opportunities between rich and poor, white and nonwhite, and urban and suburban offered by MALDEF and CFE is to equalize funding among the districts; the revolutionary alternative would be to eliminate the district structure-that is, the absolute spaces.\n\nWe must do both: envision not only equal access to a high-quality education for poor, rich, nonwhite, and white but also a new distribution of education in which a transformation of the absolute spaces would mark the dissolution of racial and economic inequalities. These spaces were produced from specific social relations that spatialized and polarized city residents economically and racially. In turn, those spaces now work to reinforce the same social relations that produced them. Poorly funded schools, located in property-poor neighborhoods, are producing poorly educated students, and vice versa; and racially homogeneous schools are producing young adults who never leave the barrio or the suburb. The geographer's contribution to the education-finance crisis in the United States may be a total reconceptualization of the spatial organization of property and service delivery and its effect on childhood opportunities from one of a series of centered spaces wholly responsible for their own existence to one of relational spaces that adapt with, conform to, and help shape changing social relations. NOTES I. The home-rule movement began in 1875 as a devolution of power from the federal and state levels of government to the municipal level. Home rule allows a municipality to exercise any function as long as it is consistent with the state constitution.\n\n2. The term \"Anglo American\" is usual parlance in Texas, where ethnic categories are used instead of racial ones when referring to various social groups.\n\n3. Neighborhoods could form an independent school district without actually incorporating legally (thus the phrase \"incorporating for the sole purpose of their schools\"). 4. On 23 March 2006 the Appellate Division of the State Supreme Court of New York directed the state to provide New York City Schools an additional $4.7 billion in operating costs and $9.2 billion in capital funding.\n\nFIG. 1 -\n1Independent school districts in San Antonio and Bexal-County, Texas.
