In general, existing solutions to cyberattacks focus on creating redundancy and/or enhancing security levels of sensing and communication networks. These solutions require intensive offline efforts and therefore are economically expensive. Further, they are generally inefficient when dealing with dynamic attacks. This paper proposes a novel density-based spatial clustering approach for online detection, classification, and data recovery for data manipulation attacks to PMU measurements.

The proposed approach is also independent of the conventional state estimation (SE). Comprehensive case studies demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.\n\nI. INTRODUCTION\n\nMART grid technologies, phasor measurement units (PMUs) for instance, are being rapidly integrated into power systems. On the one hand, these technologies bring vitality to the electricity grid by enhancing system reliability, enabling faster controls, and facilitating widespread connection of distributed energy resources (DERs). On the other hand, they are heavily dependent upon information and communications technologies, making power systems vulnerable to cyberattacks. Presently, cyberattacks associated with PMU measurements can be categorized into six types [1]: denial-ofservice attack, physical attack, Man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack, packet analysis, malicious code injection, and data spoofing. Among them, MITM and data spoofing can both be categorized into data integrity attacks. Telemetered data such as power injections, line flows, voltage measurements from PMUs and the status information of breakers and switches are vulnerable to such attacks [2] which is also the main concern of this paper.\n\nPMUs collect voltage and current phasors across the electric power grid in real time and send them to control centers with a designated format. Data manipulation attacks can occur at any point of the data transmission chain. A control center's normal operation can be affected by unauthentic measurements and jeopardize the stable operation of the power grid. Presently, state estimation is a key application that is responsible for detection and rejection of bad data [3]. However, it has been demonstrated in [4] that false data injection (FDI) attacks can be undetectable to state estimation if malicious attackers craft stealthy attack vectors. Generally speaking, existing countermeasures for cyberattacks to PMU measurements can be classified into two categories: approaches that focus on creating data redundancy [5]- [7], and approaches that focus on data security enhancement [8]- [10].\n\nThe first type of methods enhances system observability via optimal placement of PMUs. The second type of approaches improves security levels of the communication network through data encryption or masking. In practice, implementation of these approaches requires significant offline efforts and therefore is economically expensive. Further, cyberattacks can be highly dynamic and unpredictable, and power system topology and operating conditions are constantly changing. It is difficult for these existing approaches to adjust and often restrictive and inadequate for them to deal with dynamically evolving cyber threats under changing system environment.\n\nTo fight against evolving cyber threats, several advanced intrusion detection systems (IDSs) have been developed in recent years [11]- [13]. These solutions are more robust towards different types of data manipulation attacks resulting from their independence from the existing bad data detection schemes. However, most IDSs either require accurate system configurations to be known a priori, or can only detect attacks without data recovery capability, which is sometimes critical for power systems. For example, in [11], the authors propose an online anomaly detection algorithm which synthesizes forecasted load, generation schedules, and PMU data. Effectiveness of this approach is heavily dependent upon the accuracy of load forecasting, which itself has high uncertainty. In [12], the authors propose an attack detection mechanism through evaluating equivalent impedances of transmission lines. This approach can identify abnormal changes of transmission line (TL) parameters and hence identify the measurement under attack. However, this method is incapable to identify attacks involving multiple measurement channels. A protocol using a random time hopping sequence is proposed to detect data tampering in [18]. However, again, it requires accurate system configuration to be known, which is difficult in practice, and no data recovery solution is provided. Purely data-driven attack detection mechanisms like [14]- [17] rely on the historical attacking data for model training which is usually impractical. In [18]- [20], the authors detect the data integrity attack by cross-validating other regional substations, but these approaches are not effective for attacks on multiple substations. Moreover, the data recovery work is not being addressed as it is more critical under attack scenarios with multiple compromised measurements.\n\nIn this paper, we present a novel data mining-based approach which detects and fixes data manipulation attacks to the wide area monitoring system (WAMS). The core algorithm proposed in this paper is the density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise (DBSCAN), which has been demonstrated to be very effective in [21] for PMU bias error correction. The major contributions of this framework include:\n\n\u2022 a sensitive attack detection mechanism which applies to attacks as small as 1e -4 p.u.; \u2022 an accurate data recovery scheme for compromised PMU measurements from one or multiple channels; \u2022 a robust and adaptive algorithm to changing and inaccurate knowledge of system configurations. The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section II describes the problem and related mathematical model. Section III presents the proposed framework. Case studies are presented in section IV while conclusion and future work are discussed in section V.\n\n\nII. THREAT MODEL DESCRIPTION AND FORMULATION\n\n\nA. Threat Model Description\n\nPMUs measure voltages and currents at critical substations on the power grid and output truly synchronized accurate voltage and current phasors. Those measurements can be used by the local Independent System Operator (ISO) to monitor and control the system frequency changes, real time power flow etc.\n\nFrom an attacker's point of view, driving the system away from a pre-determined (optimal) operational trajectory, by manipulating the current and voltage phasor measurements, is attractive from both economic and security perspectives. Such kind of attacks have drawn lots of attention over the past few years [22], [23]. Economically, the manipulated PMU measurements can target altering the solution of the Economic Dispatch Problem (EDP). For example, the manipulated EDP solution can schedule more generation from the high-cost units, which causes malicious destruction to the existing electricity market mechanism. The resulting market tilt may distribute more financial benefits to the attackers' side. The concealment nature of such attacks makes the cost of crime much lower than the economic benefits that can be obtained. From a security perspective, by tampering with the power system measurement data and affecting the normal dispatching operation of the power system, such attacks can cause the grid control/dispatch center to issue detrimental commands. In this way, a cyberterrorist can directly threaten the power supply and even national security. The attackers, therefore, have sufficient motivations to perform such malicious attacks.\n\nIn order to successfully inject manipulated data onto the raw PMU measurements, attackers need to have access to the PDC network. An insider (such as a malicious employee or contractor or an infected hardware device) who has access to the PMU data concentrator (PDC) network is the best executor of such attacks. In addition, outsiders who can break in the NASPInet architecture of PDC network can also launch such attacks, since PMUs are connected to an IP-based communication network like an Intranet. Although the communication network is dedicated Intranet and isolated from public networks, it is not immune to cyber-attacks [6]. The data manipulating methods considered in this paper are minor step attacks and ramp attacks which are very difficult to observe using the existing infrastructure/approaches. Without detailed system configuration, attackers can perform these kinds of attacks by adding a minor constant or a slope to the original data packet which is effective and costs the least effort from the attacker's point of view [12]. At the same time, it costs nearly negligible time delay which can mask the action. Once the attack is successfully implemented, it can bias power system state estimates, induce the regional control center to issue detrimental control actions, cause less economic power dispatch, and result in the adversary's monetary gains and outages and/or damages.\n\nWith sufficient knowledge of a power system, an adversary can maximize damages to the grid without being detected by the conventional bad data detection scheme [24]- [26], [32]- [34]. For example, as a general rule of thumb, the manipulated voltage measurements can be within 5% of their nominal values, and current measurements can be within the nominal capacities. It has been recognized that even small errors in the data can have catastrophic impacts to the grid. PMUs, specially, as a highly integrated measuring device, are vulnerable in: 1) voltage magnitude, 2) voltage angle, 3) current magnitude, and 4) current angle. This paper considers two common types of attacks: (1) a step attack which biases the data by a constant value, and (2) a ramp attack which modifies the data in a slow and linear manner. Instead of causing immediate contingency and protection actions to the grid, these attack models bring financial losses to utilities by causing uneconomic dispatch, fake line congestion alarms, etc., in undetectable manners [12]. These two attack models are briefly discussed below. 1)\n\nStep attack:\n{ ( + ) [ ( )+ ] , ( \u2264 \u2264 ) ( ) , ( < \u222a > )(1)\nwhere A is a phasor magnitude, ( ) is a phasor angle, a and b are constant bias added to the magnitude and angle of A(t), respectively. ts and te denote the start and end times of the attack.\n\n2) Ramp attack:\n{ ( + \u2032 ( \u2212 )) [ ( )+ \u2032 ( \u2212 )] , ( \u2264 \u2264 ) ( ) , ( < \u222a > )(2)\nwhere \u2032 and \u2032 are the ramping slopes of magnitude and phase angle, respectively.\n\n\nB. Measurement Model\n\nPMUs, installed at the two ends of a TL, monitor the realtime status of the line operation. Reversely, as stable parameters, TL parameters calculated by PMU measurements can be the indicator of PMU data reliability. A classic TL PI model shown in Fig. 1 is employed in this work [27], of which and are the positive sequence voltage and current phasors at the sending end, and are the voltage and current phasors collected from the receiving end. Variables and , denote series impedance and shunt admittance of a TL, are calculated through (3) and (4).\nY/2 Y/2 Z S I r I S V Vr Fig. 1. Transmission line nominal/equivalent PI model = \u0305 2 \u2212 \u0305 2 \u0305 \u2022 \u0305 \u2212 \u0305 \u2022 \u0305 (3) = 2 \u2022 \u0305 + \u0305 \u0305 + \u0305(4)\nSet the angle of the receiving end current as the angle reference and rewrite (3) and (4) into polar form as (5)-(7):\n= ( 2 2 \u2032 + 2 2 \u2032 \u2022 ( \u2032 + \u2032 ) \u2212 \u2022 \u2032 ) (5) = ( 2 2 \u2032 + 2 2 \u2032 \u2022 ( \u2032 + \u2032 ) \u2212 \u2022 \u2032 ) (6) = (2 \u2022 \u2022 \u2032 + \u2032 + \u2032 )(7)\nwhere \u2032 = \u2212 , \u2032 = \u2212 , and \u2032 = \u2212 . TL shunt conductance G is typically very small and therefore negligible.\n\nThe actual values of TL parameters are usually influenced by many factors including but not limited to ambient temperature, wind speed, and sags [24]. However, they can still be regarded as constants in a reasonably short period of time. But the TL parameters calculated using (5)-(7) are sensitive to the accuracy of PMU measurements, in such a way that even a small error on PMU can have a significant impact on the derived TL parameter values. Fig. 2a shows the impact on X when \u0305 is under a 5s step attack with a step value of 0.0005 p.u. Fig. 2b shows the attack impact on the value of X when \u0305 is under a 5s ramp attack with a slope of 0.0005 p.u./s. (base voltage: 500 kV). The same form of impacts can be observed on R and Bc as well, but are not shown here due to space limitation. The impacts shown in Fig. 2, can also be duplicated by attacking \u0305 , \u0305 and \u0305 or any combination of those phasors. Hence, detecting an attack is critical while identifying and recovering it is equally important and much more challenging.\n\n\nC. Problem Formulation for Step Attack\n\nA step attack on PMU measurements can be treated as a constant bias added to the true phasor value. Therefore, taking the first-order ordinary differential equations (ODEs) of (5)- (7) with respect to each measurement constitutes the relationship between abnormal TL parameters and attacks, e.g., \u2206 = (7) \u2022 \u2206 + (7) \u2022 \u2206 + \u22ef\n\n\u2032 \u2022 \u2206 \u2032 . The detailed derivation process is shown in Appendix I. For the ODEs to be valid, they must obey the Cauchy-Riemann equations [28]. The compliance checking/procedure is not discussed here due to space limitation but the validation has been conducted. The three ODEs for R, X and are collectively written into (8).\n[ \u2206 \u2206 \u2206 ] = [ ] \u2022 [ \u2206 \u2206 \u2206 \u2206 \u2206 \u2032 \u2206 \u2032 \u2206 \u2032 ](8)\nThe vector on the left-hand-side of (8), denoted as vector E, represents the difference between TL parameters calculated using PMU data and their corresponding true values. Variables AR~GB are partial derivatives or sensitivity factors as shown in Appendix I. This sensitivity matrix is denoted as H. The vector on the rightmost, denoted as F, represents the step attacks on each measurement, e.g.,\n\u2206 = _ \u2212 _ .\nIf an accurate set of line impedance parameters is known a priori, the step attack in the PMU measurements can be easily estimated using the standard least square estimator, as:\n= ( ) \u22121(9)\nVector F has seven rows and therefore to solve (9) the rank of H matrix has to be no less than seven. In other words, the row number of H should satisfy 3 \u00d7 \u2265 7 or \u2265 3, ( \u2208 * ) . Variable N is the number of snapshots of PMU measurements.\n\n\nD. Problem Formulation for Ramp Attack\n\nA ramp attack on PMU measurements cannot be treated as a constant bias like step attack. Instead, it adds a unidirectional linear time-varying error to the corresponding true value, which causes the TL parameters calculated by PMU measurements to show the same linear time-varying trend, e.g., Fig. 2.\n\nHence, in this case, vectors F, E and matrix H turn into timedependent factors as (10). \n[ \u2206 ( ) \u2206 ( ) \u2206 ( ) ] = [ ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ] \u2022 [ \u2206 ( ) \u2206 ( ) \u22ee \u2206 \u2032 ( ) ](10\nTaking derivative of (11) w.r.t. t yields (12), which becomes an equation of slope : \n=\u0302( ) \u2022 +\u0302( ) \u2022 + \u22ef +\u0302( ) \u2022 \u2032(13)\nIn the same manner, the slopes of \u2206 ( ) and \u2206 ( ) can be obtained and reorganized into (14):\n[ ] = [\u0302( ) ( ) ( ) \u0302( ) ( ) ( ) \u0302( ) ( ) ( ) \u0302( ) ( ) ( ) \u0302( ) ( ) ( ) \u0302( ) ( ) ( ) \u0302( ) ( ) ( ) ] \u2022 [ \u22ee \u2032 ](14)\nSimilar to (8), (14) can be written as \u0303=\u0303\u2022\u0303, and therefore the ramp attack on PMU measurements \u0303 can be solved via (15):\n\u0303= (\u0303\u0303) \u22121\u0303\u0303(15)\nAgain, similar to (11), at least three sets of PMU measurements at different time stamps are needed.\n\n\nIII. PROPOSED SOLUTION\n\n\nA. Attack Detection and Identification\n\nTo differentiate a step attack from a ramp attack and identify the attack start and end time, a check filter can be designed based on exponential transformation [29], as shown below:\n\u03c3 = ( + )\u2212 ( )(16)\nwhere, p denotes any TL parameter value, t denotes time in second (25/30 snapshots per second), n is length of the window. This transformation improves the attack detection accuracy in several aspects: (1) better sensitivity on small attacking signals, and (2) fast calculation enabling real-time detection. When there is no fluctuation in p, \u03c3 will always be around 1 as + \u2248 . When there is a very small fluctuation in p, \u03c3 will be influenced as seen in Fig.3 and Fig.4 (attacks in Fig.3 and Fig.4 are the same as Fig.2). Therefore, the attack can be identified when \u03c3\u22601. Once detected, criteria 1 and 2 can be applied to differentiate a step attack from a ramp attack. Abnormal fluctuations caused by a system fault, power swing etc., which does not meet any of the two criteria will not trigger protection actions. Details of criteria 1 and 2 are discussed below.\n\nCriteria 1 for step attack check:\n\n\u2022 As shown in Fig. 3: If two pulses with the opposite directions occur in \u03c3, then the step attack model is confirmed. The first pulse indicates start time, the second pulse indicates end time.\n\nCriteria 2 for ramp attack check:\n\n\u2022 As shown in Fig. 4: If the value of \u03c3 stabilizes away from 1 for a short period of time before a pulse occurring, then the ramp attack model is confirmed. The moment when \u03c3\u22601 is the attack start time, the pulse indicates end time. \n\n\nB. DBSCAN Basics\n\nDBSCAN is an unsupervised data mining technique which can classify data points of any dimension into core points, reachable points and outliers [30]. A core point p contains at least minPts points (including p) within the designated searching distance \u03b5. A reachable point q exists if there exists a path p1, p2..., q, so that all points on the path, except q, are core points. Points that are not reachable from any other point are outliers. Core points and reachable points form a cluster while outliers are excluded from such a cluster. Fig. 5 shows an example for DBSCAN with minPts=4, \u03b5 is the radius of each circle. Note that minPts has to be larger than 3. In Fig. 5, core points are in red, each of which has at least 4 points with a distance less than \u03b5. The yellow ones (reachable points) are reachable from the red ones but do not have the required minimum number of points nearby within the distance of \u03b5. The blue one is not reachable from any other point and therefore is an outlier. The red and yellow points form a cluster with the blue one excluded.\n\n\nC. Data Recovery for Compromised PMU Measurements\n\nOnce an attack is detected and identified, the data recovery process will be triggered. Equation (9) is the mathematical model used for data recovery under ideal conditions. In this ideal condition, vector is formed with accurate system configurations including TL parameters and noise-free PMU measurements. However, system parameters from the Energy Management Systems (EMS) are calculated based on tower geometry, conductor type, estimated sag, etc., at the time of commissioning. Due to multiple factors including weather, aging, and migrating geological conditions, these parameters change with time but are typically not reflected in the database. Moreover, even as a high-precision measurement device, PMU still suffers from systematic errors, noises, etc., which introduce variations to the calculated parameters. For example, it can be seen that due to noise the calculated line reactance in the first 10 seconds in Figs. 3 and 4 are not perfectly smooth. Therefore, there are always gaps between the calculated line parameters and their corresponding references from the EMS database. On top of these mismatches, a cyberattack can further enlarge the error.\n\nIn this work, we assume the additional errors caused by cyberattacks are moderate as they would be more easily detected otherwise. With this assumption, a three-dimensional search space is built for each of and \u0303, as shown in (17) and (18). We then use DBSCAN to find the and \u0303 caused by attacks within this searching space. The subscript denotes the mismatches from all possible sources. The subscript denotes the mismatches caused by cyberattacks only. Fig. 6 is an example showing how DBSCAN works. It is assumed that one PMU is tempered by 0.02 p.u. and 0.03 p.u. step attacks to its and measurements, respectively, that is, F=[0.02,0,0,0.03,0,0,0] T . In F, except for the compromised components, the other measurements are 0. Hence, we can construct a density-based spatial clustering problem by considering all components in F close to 0 as cluster members with compromised components as outliers.\n{ (1 \u2212 1 )\u2206 \u2264 \u2206 \u2264 (1 + 1 )\u2206 (1 \u2212 1 )\u2206 \u2264 \u2206 \u2264 (1 + 1 )\u2206 (1 \u2212 1 )\u2206 \u2264 \u2206 \u2264 (1 + 1 )\u2206 (17) { (1 \u2212 2 ) \u2264 \u2264 (1 + 2 ) (1 \u2212 2 ) \u2264 \u2264 (1 + 2 ) (1 \u2212 2 ) \u2264 \u2264 (1 + 2 )(18)\nThen, let ( ) be a random sample point in the threedimensional space, n be the sampling step on each axis (R, X and ). Then there will be n 3 samples in the space. Put each sample ( ) ( \u2208 [1,3 ]) into (11), one ( ) will be generated correspondingly. Apply DBSCAN clustering to each ( ), with minPts=3, and an initial \u03b5 (0) . Afterwards, those F vectors with the largest cluster members around 0 will be extracted. Then, iteratively applying DBSCAN on those F vectors with decreasing \u03b5, we can end the iteration when one cluster with the minimum \u03b5min is found. That vector will be the one closest to the designed attack F=[0.02,0,0,0.03,0,0,0] T , where the core points indicate the PMU measurements which are not attacked and the outliers in that vector indicate the compromised PMU measurements. In summary, DBSCAN is used in onedimensional data clustering in this application, which is to find the maximum cluster around 0 with a minimum searching distance \u03b5min within the searching space. Such a cluster indicates the attack information. The reason that this cluster can ensure finding the sources of the attack is that each element in /\u0303 is linearly related to any element in /\u0303 [21].\n\nIt is also noted that any frequency change will alter the TL parameter values. However, the change in frequency will not affect the accuracy of our algorithm as (8) and (14) still hold with a varying frequency. Even though the equation (16) may be trigged, our algorithm can still capture a frequency attack by observing a zero vector / . If CP1 (i)< CP (i) do // if number of core points decreases for decreasing \u03b5 (1,2,3\u2026) remove( /\u0303( )) // remove /\u0303( ) from next iteration Endforeach Endforeach // end until the /\u0303( ) with minimum \u03b5 is found /\u0303with maximum core points and minimum \u03b5 output A flowchart of the proposed data mining-based PMU cyberattack identification approach is shown in Fig. 7 \n\n\nA. Case I: An Illustrative Example\n\nIn order to illustrate the procedure, in Case I we assume that only reference has an error of -4%, with and references accurate. A 0.02 p.u. step attack is injected into the from 13-20 sec. Error band is set to be 20%. Gaussian noise with SNR=70dB is added to the PMU measurements. The proposed approach scans 200 points within the error band. Each component in vector F is plotted against the errors in reference as shown in Fig. 8. The dashed line marks the result of density-based spatial clustering resulting from the DBSCAN algorithm. Fig. 9 shows the size of each cluster and the corresponding searching distance \u03b5 against \u2202R. Results are summarized in Table II, which shows the 0.02 p.u. step attack on \u0305 magnitude has been successfully identified.   Fig. 10 shows the comparison between the sending-end current \u0305 , the compromised one, and the corresponding phasor after recovery. The recovered \u0305 matches well with its true value. \n\n\nB. Case II: Simultaneous Step Attacks on Two Measurements\n\nIn this case, step attacks are injected into two measurement channels during 10-15 sec, with an attack level of 0.0002 p.u. on , and 0.0005 rad (0.0286 degrees) on \u2032 . This attack level is set to a very small range with the purpose of demonstrating the sensitivity of the proposed algorithm. In our tests, we prove that a higher level (10-3-10-2 p.u.) step attack can be easily identified with 70 dB SNR Gaussian noise added in the PMU measurements. And we set the error of TL parameter references to be [-3.18%, -4.30%, 0.50%]. A 20% error band is considered for the searching space. Fig. 11 visualizes the results of density-based spatial clustering using DBSCAN, with the color of the points indicating the size of the cluster at each sampling point. The 4 samples in red yield clusters with the maximum size, among which the one with a black circle has the minimum \u03b5. The experimental results are summarized in Table III, and the relationships between the true, compromised, and recovered measurements are shown in Fig. 12.\n\nIt should be noted that, in the rare case, if the attacking signal has a magnitude smaller than the standard deviation of noise, it will be very difficult to differentiate the attacking signal from normal PMU measurements. But we note that it is less likely for an attack of that small to cause noticeable detrimental effects to the grid and it should happen very rarely.  In this case, two ramp attacks of 0.0055 p.u./s and 0.0018 rad/s (or 0.1 degree/s) are injected into and \u2032 during 15-30 sec, respectively, and 2 is set to be \u00b15%. Gaussian noise with SNR=70dB is added to the PMU measurements. Fig. 13 summarizes the clustering results of the proposed algorithm. The attack identification result is presented in Table  IV, and the relationship between the true, compromised, and recovered measurements is shown in Fig. 14.  \n\n\nD. Effectiveness Validation on Multiple Cases\n\nThe same set of tests have been further conducted on PMUs installed for several types of standard transmission lines, whose configurations (60 Hz, 77\u00b0F) can be accessed from [31]. The test results shown in TABLE V further demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm under different system configurations and scenarios. \n\n\nV. CONCLUSION\n\nThis paper presents a novel framework for detection, identification, and data recovery of data integrity attacks to PMU measurements. Compared to existing approaches, the proposed one has four major merits: 1) independent of system topological changes and therefore adaptive and effective for changing system configurations, 2) effective for simultaneous attacks to multiple channels, 3) sensitive and robust to small attacking signals, which are difficult to detect with existing bad data detection methods, and 4) capable of providing bad data recovery solutions which maintain the data consistency. Therefore, the proposed framework is applicable across a wide spectrum of practical conditions. Future work includes: 1) integrating more attack models, 2) expanding existing linespecific computing capability to the network level to achieve real-time monitoring for a larger grid, and 3) decomposing the spatial clustering process so that state-of-the-art parallel computing techniques can be employed to speed up the computation.\n\nVI.
