Methods: Between May 2012 and February 2015, 589 thyroid nodules in 519 patients were diagnosed as benign or malignant by surgical excision. Experienced radiologists retrospectively reviewed the US of the thyroid nodules in a test set. CNNs were trained and tested using retrospective data of 439 and 150 US images, respectively. Diagnostic performances were compared between the two groups. Results: Of the 589 thyroid nodules, 396 were malignant and 193 were benign. The area under the curve (AUC) for diagnosing thyroid malignancy was 0.805-0.860 for radiologists. The AUCs for diagnosing thyroid malignancy for the three CNNs were 0.845, 0.835, and 0.850. There was no significant difference in AUC between radiologists and CNNs. Conclusions: CNNs showed comparable diagnostic performance compared to experienced radiologists in differentiating thyroid malignancy on US.\n\nor irregular margins, microcalcifications, and taller-than-wide shape have been associated with thyroid malignancy. [1][2][3]6,7 According to most of these guidelines, fine-needle aspiration (FNA) is recommended for thyroid nodules equal or more than 1 cm in size, whereas various size cutoffs are used to recommend FNA to small thyroid nodules (ie, nodules measuring 1-2 cm).\n\nUS has intrinsic limitations due to performer dependency in terms of acquired image quality and image interpretation, with its diagnostic performance varying among radiologists. [8][9][10][11] Although these technical operator-dependent components and variations in acquired image quality cannot be addressed by quantitative analysis, quantitative analysis can overcome variation and lack of reproducibility in image interpretation, and a multiple quantitative analysis has been developed to validate the effectiveness for differentiating thyroid malignancy. Quantitative measurement of thyroid nodules through histogram analysis was suggested as an objective method to stratify US features, and numerical estimates could significantly differentiate benign nodules from malignant nodules. 12 However, when the diagnostic performances of quantitative analysis and visual assessment by radiologists were compared in predicting thyroid malignancy, quantitative analysis showed relatively inferior diagnostic performance compared to traditional grayscale US. 13,14 A number of machine learning algorithms using US images have been investigated for the differential diagnosis of thyroid nodules and have shown conflicting results when diagnostic performances were compared between these algorithms and visual assessment by radiologists. [15][16][17][18][19][20] The convolutional neural network (CNN) is a typical type of deep learning technique with fully trainable models and is accepted as a state-of-the-art method. 21,22 Ma et al. 23 first attempted a CNN-based method to classify thyroid nodules and the method was shown to be eligible for thyroid nodule diagnosis, but their study did not enroll patients in a clinical setting and did not compare diagnostic performances between CNN and radiologists. In this study, we designed a computerized algorithm to predict thyroid malignancy using a deep CNN to differentiate malignant and benign thyroid nodules on US, and compared the diagnostic performance of CNN with that of experienced radiologists.\n\n\n| MATERIAL AND METHODS\n\nThis study was approved by the institutional review board and informed consent was waived.\n\n\n| Study population\n\nBetween May 2012 and February 2015, 1576 consecutive patients underwent US and subsequent thyroidectomy in our institution. Among them, we included 589 nodules equal to or larger than 1 cm and less than 2 cm on US with available pathologic results that had been correlated with US findings from 519 patients. The mean age of the 519 patients (426 women and 93 men) was 47.5 years AE12.7 (SD; age range, 12-79 years). The mean size of the 589 nodules was 12.9 mm AE 2.5 (range, 10-19 mm). Of the total 589 nodules, 439 were allocated to the training set, whereas 150 were allocated to the independent test set, using computer-generated random numbers. The randomly chosen 439 nodules of the training set were composed of 297 malignant and 142 benign nodules. To balance the numbers of the malignant and benign nodules (297 vs 142), we generated 142 left-right and 13 updown mirroring images for the benign nodules so that a total of 594 nodules, consisting of 297 malignant and 297 benign nodules, made up the training set.\n\n\n| Image acquisition\n\nPreoperative staging US was performed by 1 of 12 radiologists dedicated to thyroid imaging with a 5 to 12-MHz linear transducer (iU22; Philips Healthcare, Bothell, Washington) or a 6 to 13-MHz linear transducer (EUB-7500; Hitachi Medical, Tokyo, Japan). For experiments, a representative US image was acquired for each tumor considering US and pathologic reports by an experienced thyroid radiologist (K.J.Y. with 16 years of experience in thyroid US imaging), and the following features were used to select the image: clear characterization of the margin, internal content, anteroposterior dimension-to-transverse dimension ratio, and the presence of microcalcifications highlighting benign or suspicious findings. The images were stored as JPEG images from the picture archiving and communication system. Using the Paint program of Window 7, square regions of interest (ROIs) were drawn by a radiologist (L.J.H.) covering the whole nodule ( Figure 1). The ROIs were then checked by a supervising radiologist (K.J.Y.).\n\n\n| Implementation of the deep CNN\n\nTo train the CNN with our data, the ROIs were extracted from each US image. In the extraction process, we first collected the exact position information of the yellow ROI boundary. As drawing the ROI with a colored pen can alter the original intensity of the US image, the collected boundary information of ROI was applied to a duplicate US image without ROI marking. In this way, we could block interference from colored markings of the ROI while the CNN learned the image features. Extracted ROI images were labeled with each patient's ID number and again saved as JPEG files to use as training and testing images.\n\nThe deep CNN implementation was performed using the MathConvNet package 24 and MATLAB version 9.2 (R2017a, The MathWorks, Inc., Natick, Massachusetts). Two pretrained CNN models, \"imagenet-vgg-verydeep-16\" 25 and \"imagenet-vgg-f,\" 26 were used in our recognition task through a fine-tuning process. Before conducting the CNNs, all 589 ROI nodules were once again resized to conform to the standards of the pretrained models, imagenet-vgg and imagenet-verydeep. These pretrained models were trained using about 1.2 million images sized 224 \u00d7 224 \u00d7 3. In order to make images applicable to these CNN models, all images in the training and test sets had to be resized to 224 \u00d7 224 \u00d7 3. Then, we replaced the layers with random weights in the pretrained network and trained the network again. The resulting trained CNNs, called CNN1, CNN2, and CNN3, generated continuous numbers between 0 and 1 for binary classification, which corresponded to the probability of a given test image being malignant or benign. The effectiveness of each algorithm was validated through a 3-fold cross validation. In the backpropagation process, the learning rate was varied from 10 \u22123 to 10 \u22124.5 to avoid the diverging network. As these convolution networks do not have regularization, we added a dropout layer with a rate of 0.5 to the network as shown in Figure 2. 25 The best regularization method would be to add more training data, but the amount of available data was limited. Instead, we turned off the network connections randomly to reduce the dependence of a unit in one layer on a unit in the previous layer. This random dropping out of network connections helped prevent overfitting and let the network be generalized for test data by allowing the learned weights to rely less on training data.\n\nThe decisions of CNN1, CNN2, and CNN3 for 150 test images provide the diagnostic performance of each CNN (for details, see Supporting Information).\n\n\n| Image analyses\n\nThe US features of the thyroid nodules in the test set were interpreted and were retrospectively recorded according to the Thyroid Imaging Reporting and Data System (TIRADS) developed by Kwak et al. 3 and the criteria from Kim et al. 2 by two radiologists (K.J.Y. and Y.J.H. who had 16 and 9 years of experience in thyroid US imaging, respectively). For TIRADS, solid component, hypoechogenicity or markedly hypoechogenicity, microlobulated or irregular margins, microcalcifications, and taller-than-wide shape were regarded as suspicious features. 3 For the criteria from Kim et al., 2 markedly hypoechogenicity, microlobulated or irregular margins, microcalcifications, and taller-than-wide shape were assessed as suspicious features. Each radiologist categorized the nodules as benign or malignant based on the aforementioned two guidelines. When any of the suspicious US features were present, the nodule was classified as malignant, and if there was no suspicious US feature, the nodule was classified as benign.\n\n\n| Data and statistical analysis\n\nThe histopathological diagnosis of thyroid nodules was established by surgery. The generalized estimating equation was used to compare demographic features between the training and test sets. Diagnostic performances of radiologists and CNNs for predicting thyroid malignancy were evaluated and compared with the generalized estimating equation according to sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), FIGURE 2 Added dropout layer in the given convolutional neural networks (CNNs): The pretrained CNN models \"vgg-f\" and \"vgg-verydeep16\" have 21 and 37 layers, respectively. To prevent overfitting, one dropout layer was added to these two nets [Color figure can be viewed at wileyonlinelibrary.com] negative predictive value (NPV), and accuracy. The diagnostic performances of radiologists and CNNs were assessed using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis, and the area under the curve (AUC) was obtained. Cutoff values were defined for CNNs for the diagnosis of thyroid malignancy using You den's index. 27 The interobserver variability between radiologists for US assessment using TIRADS 3 and the criteria by Kim et al. 2 was calculated using kappa statistics. A kappa value (\u03ba) of 0.20 or less indicated slight agreement; 0.21-0.40, fair agreement; 0.41-0.60, moderate agreement; 0.61-0.80, substantial agreement; and 0.81-1.00, almost perfect agreement. 28 P values <.05 were considered statistically significant. Data analysis was performed using SAS software, version 9.4 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, North Carolina).\n\n\n| RESULTS\n\n\n| Patient characteristics\n\nThere were 396 (67%) malignant nodules and 193 (33%) benign ones. All these nodules were confirmed by histopathological examination after surgical excision. The histopathologic results are listed in Table 1. The demographics of the training and test sets are summarized in Table 2. The mean size of the thyroid nodules, female-to-male ratio, and the proportions of thyroid malignancy were not significantly different between the training and test sets. The mean age of patients in the training set (46.7 AE 12.7 years) was younger than that of patients in the test set (49.7 AE 12.2 years) (P = .02). Table 3 presents the diagnostic performances of 2 radiologists and the 3 trained models of CNN1, CNN2, and CNN3\n\n\n| Comparison of diagnostic performances between experienced radiologists and CNNs for diagnosing thyroid malignancy\n\nfor diagnosing thyroid malignancy. The diagnostic performances of the CNNs were compared with the diagnostic performance of radiologist 1 based on the TIRADS criteria from Kwak et al. 3 The accuracy of the CNNs ranged from 86.0% to 88.0%, although there were no significant differences for accuracy among CNN1, CNN2, CNN3, and radiologist 1 by TIRADS (87.3%, 88.0%, 86.0%, vs 87.3%, respectively; P = 1.00, .82, and .68, respectively. The sensitivity of radiologist 1 by TIRADS was higher than the sensitivities of all three CNNs (95.0% vs 90.0% for CNN 1, 91.0% for CNN 2, and 84.0% for CNN 3; P = .09, .15, and .003, respectively). For specificity, all trained CNN models including CNN1, CNN2, and CNN3 demonstrated higher specificities compared to radiologist 1 by TIRADS (82.0%, 82.0%, and 90.0% vs 72.0%; P = .15, .15, and .001, respectively). For PPV, all trained CNN models including CNN1, CNN2, and CNN3 demonstrated higher PPVs compared with the 87.2% PPV of radiologist 1 by TIRADS, with the PPVs being 90.9%, 91.0%, and 94.4% for CNN1, CNN2, and CNN3, respectively (P = .21, .209, and .004, respectively). All trained CNN models including CNN1, CNN2, and CNN3 demonstrated lower NPVs compared to the 87.8% NPV of radiologist 1 by TIRADS, with the NPVs being 80.4%, 82.0%, and 73.8%, respectively (P = .17, .27, and .01, respectively).\n\nThe highest sensitivity and NPV were observed in radiologist 1 by TIRADS (95.0% and 87.8%, respectively), whereas the highest specificity, accuracy, and PPV were observed in CNNs (91.0% in CNN3, 88.0% in CNN2, and 94.4% in CNN3, respectively). When the diagnostic performances of radiologist 2 (by both TIRADS and Kim et al.) and radiologist 1 by TIRADS were compared, higher specificity and PPV were seen in radiologist 1 without statistical significance (82.0% vs 72%; P = .15, 89.8% vs 87.2%; P = .41), whereas lower sensitivity and NPV were observed in radiologist 1 with statistical significance (79% vs 95%; P < .001, 66.1% vs 87.8%; P < .001, respectively). When the diagnostic performances of radiologist 1 by TIRADS and radiologist 1 by Kim et al. were compared, higher specificity and PPV (90.0% and 72.0% vs 94.3%; P = .001, 87.2%; P = .005, respectively), and lower sensitivity and NPV (82.0% vs 95.0%; P < .001, 71.4% vs 87.8%; P < .001, respectively) were seen for radiologist 1 by Kim et al. compared to radiologist 1 by TIRADS.   (Table 3). There were no significant differences in AUC between radiologist 1 by TIR-ADS and CNNs.\n\n\n| Interobserver variability of radiologists in the diagnosis of thyroid malignancy on US\n\nInterobserver agreements between the two radiologists were fair (\u03ba = 0.523 and 0.575, respectively; 95% confidence interval = 0.386-0.659 and 0.442-0.708, respectively) for both TIRADS developed by Kwak et al. and the criteria by Kim et al.\n\n\n| DISCUSSION\n\nThe 3 CNNs of our study all showed favorable diagnostic performances for differentiating thyroid malignancy on US, demonstrating specificities of 82.0%-90.0%, accuracies of 86.0%-88.0%, and PPVs of 90.9%-94.4%, similar to those of experienced radiologists, indicating a promising ability to classify benign and malignant thyroid nodules. Although CNN uses input images provided by radiologists, the most experienced radiologist was asked to accurately observe and select US images, because this process was important in developing the models. The process of image acquisition such as choosing input images of thyroid nodules and outlining ROIs is inherently operator dependent due to variations in the radiologists' perceptions and the possibility of overlooking conspicuous features. Future studies are needed to reveal whether different ROI quantification methods yield significantly different results and to decide what the optimum method for ROI is in the quantitative analysis of US regarding deep CNN. Although radiologists output a single prediction per image with binary classification, CNN produces a continuous output (eg, an estimate of malignancy probability per case). To compare the diagnostic performances of experienced radiologists and CNNs, the output from CNNs was binarized by using a Youden index with a cutoff value and the results are listed on Table 3.\n\nOn the other hand, our results showed only fair interobserver agreement between the two experienced radiologists. These results may be because US is inherently dependent on the expertise of the performer, and because radiologists do not effectively use all available US findings to distinguish benign and malignant thyroid nodules. Previous multiple studies reported a high variability among radiologists in US findings thought to predict thyroid malignancy. 10,29,30 Also, even though microcalcifications have the highest PPV among US features, they are only detected in 26.1%-59.1% of malignancies. 6 To overcome these limitations of thyroid US, many automated US image analysis techniques have been extensively studied with different input data formats, features, methods, and classifiers. When 3 classifiers including the K-Nearest Neighbor, Probabilistic Neural Network, and Decision Tree were used, sensitivity, specificity, PPV, and accuracy showed very excellent values, more than 98%. 19 However, diagnostic performances for evaluating thyroid malignancy were better with examinations by radiologists than classifier models including the radial basis functionneural network, Naive Bayes classifier, and support vector machine (SVM). 16 Recently, CNN, CNN combined with other classifiers, and other classifiers alone have been investigated for diagnosing thyroid nodules. 23 Using CNN-based methods resulted in better diagnostic performances than using the SVM, co-occurrence matrix features, and histogram features to classify thyroid nodules. 23 However, diagnostic performances have not been compared between the CNNs and radiologists. The detection of thyroid nodules has exponentially increased with the widespread use of various imaging modalities including US. 31,32 To diagnose clinically significant thyroid cancers, many guidelines have been introduced to select which thyroid nodules need to undergo FNA. 1,6,7,33 The size and US features of thyroid nodules are important factors used to decide whether or not to perform FNA. Most management guidelines use similar but different combinations of US features to recommend FNA for small thyroid nodules measuring 1-2 cm. 1,6,7,33 Considering the low reproducibility of US, 8-10,30 more objective methods are needed to help radiologists and patients decide how to manage thyroid nodules. Therefore, this study focused on small thyroid nodules and demonstrated the possibility of the CNN as a diagnostic or assistant tool for radiologists.\n\nThere are several limitations to this study. First, most of the thyroid cancer subtypes included in this study were classical papillary thyroid carcinomas. As the US findings of thyroid cancer differ according to the histopathologic subtype of cancer, future studies that include various types of thyroid malignancies are needed. Second, this study was retrospectively performed, in which a selection bias is inevitable. Third, we included thyroid nodules equal to or larger than 1 cm and less than 2 cm, which may have affected the results and our outcome may not be reproducible in other studies with different nodule size groups. Fourth, the total sample size is somewhat small and cannot be representative of the entire population. Thus, multicenter studies with larger data are needed to validate the CNNs. Fifth, we used a single image as a representative image. Future studies that include other standard views are needed to determine whether both transverse and longitudinal images aid in reducing variation among radiologists when they select representative images and to determine whether both images help CNN learn sensitive and interpretable characteristics. Finally, we used different scanners in CNNs, which may have caused the differing diagnostic performances of the CNNs. Different scanner acquisitions may affect the different outcomes of CNNs. We anticipate further analytic efforts to appraise this issue in a future study to help better generalization and validation of CNNs in real clinical practice.\n\nIn conclusion, the CNNs showed comparable diagnostic performance compared to experienced radiologists in distinguishing malignant thyroid nodules from benign nodules on US. Therefore, the CNN can be employed as a useful method for the diagnosis of thyroid malignancy.\n\nFIGURE 1\n1Implementation framework of convolutional neural network (CNN).
