INTRODUCTION\n\nA variety of techniques for modeling cybersecurity attacks and defense approaches have been proposed. The use of treestructures, known as attack, defense and threat trees, is one popular paradigm. Several firms have proposed their own approaches, such as Lockheed Martin's Cyber Kill Chain [1] and the MITRE ATT&CK frameworks [2], [3]. All of these approaches share the similarity of modeling a paradigm for actions that can be taken to attack and, either explicitly or implicitly, actions that can be stopped to secure infrastructure and other resources.\n\nA generalized distributed cyber warfare system [4], [5], based upon the Blackboard Architecture [6] has also been proposed. This system uses the Blackboard Architecture for decision-making and modeling the virtual battlefield [4]. Attacks were left to be individually defined modules This paper proposes a generalized solution for modeling framework/paradigm-based attacks that go beyond the deployment of a single exploit against a single identified target.\n\nThe Blackboard Architecture Cyber Command Entity attack Route (BACCER) identification system is designed to model complex attack paradigms using a Blackboard Architecture network. It combines rules and facts that implement attack type determination and attack decision making logic with actions that implement reconnaissance techniques and attack and defense actions.\n\nThe efficacy of the proposed BACCER system concept is demonstrated and evaluated by using it to model examples of attack and defense trees and the Cyber Kill Chain. Its efficacy for modeling other frameworks and paradigms (such as the MITRE ATT&CK framework) is discussed.\n\n\nII. BACKGROUND\n\nThis section presents prior work in several related areas that provides a foundation for the work presented herein. First, several paradigms for attack, defense and threat analysis and design are presented. Strom, et al. [2] suggests that these models can be divided into three categories, high-level, midlevel and low-level. While this classification system isn't exact, it is informative. In this section, first, attack, defense and threat trees are reviewed. These are the lowest level of model discussed herein and can potentially model down to the individual exploit or attack level. Then, the MITRE ATT&CK model is reviewed. ATT&CK is a mid-level model, according to Strom, et al. [2]. Next, the Lockheed Martin Cyber Kill Chain and STRIDE frameworks (both high level models [2]) are reviewed. Finally, the section concludes with a review of prior work related to Blackboard Architectures. The Blackboard Architecture is the implementation technology for the work presented herein.\n\n\nA. Attack, Defense and Threat Trees\n\nA variety of tree structures have been proposed for cybersecurity modeling. Attack trees model \"attack strategies against a system\" [7]. Dewri, et al. [8] note that most modern attacks will require the exploitation of multiple vulnerabilities in concert to be successful. Attack trees provide the benefit of identifying attribute knowledge needed for attacks and they facilitate taking a modular approach to the attack challenge [8]. A fundamental problem with attack tress, however, is that they fail to consider the potential countermeasures that can be deployed against the attacks [7].\n\nBistarelli, Fioravanti and Peretti [9] propose defense trees as a solution to this problem. Defense trees start from attack trees and are defined as being \"built by adding a set of countermeasures to the leaves of an attack tree\" [9]. Bistarelli, Aglio and Peretti [10] note that these trees can be used to predict what attack and defense strategies will be most effective for attackers and defenders, respectively.\n\nA number of additional types of attack/defense related trees have been proposed. Defense trees were developed based on \"extending attacks trees with countermeasures\" [9]. Attack response trees include information on both attacks and responses but suffered from issues of \"state-space explosion\" [11]. Finally, attack countermeasure trees were proposed by Roy, Kim and Trivedi [11] which allow defenses to be located anywhere in the tree (defense trees required defenses to be leaf nodes) and facilitate probabilistic analysis of security measures.\n\nAt a higher level, threat trees were developed for planning purposes. They \"identify how and under what condition threats can be realized\" [12]. This knowledge is designed to facilitate risk estimation and aid in identifying what to employ countermeasures against and what countermeasures to employ. Threat trees use a four-phase treat modeling process [12] which includes system decomposition, threat analysis for each decomposed component, threat risk analysis and threat prioritization.\n\n\nB. The ATT&CK Framework\n\nThe MITRE ATT&CK framework is a threat-based model that includes (among other components) seven operational phases, a ten component tactic matrix and a seven-phase analytics method [3]. It is built on an object model that has an adversary group that uses software that implements techniques which the adversary then uses to accomplish tactics [2].\n\nThe seven phase operational model is similar to other modeling frameworks and is comprised of phases titled [3]:\nRecon Weaponize Deliver Exploit Control Execute Maintain\nDuring the control, execute and maintain phases, the framework uses tactics to achieve the stated phase goals [3]. Ten categories of tactics have been defined, which include [3]: Each category has between 8 and 29 component tactics. Some, like Rundll32 and Regsvr32 (which are categorized under defense evasion [3]) are platform specific. Others, like credential manipulation and credential dumping (which are categorized under credential access [3]) can be used across multiple platforms. Some tactics, such as DLL injection (which has been included in both the privilege escalation and defense evasion categories [3]), have been included in multiple categories.\n\nThe ATT&CK analytics method was developed to characterize adversary techniques to facilitate better detection of adversary behaviors [3]. This method begins with behavior identification, data is then acquired and analytics are developed. Once this is complete, an \"adversary emulation scenario\" is created, the threat is emulated by a participating red team and the attack is investigated [3]. Finally, the performance of the developed analytics to detect the target behavior is reviewed.\n\nThe work herein will focus on the modeling operational model phases and tactics.\n\n\nC. Cyber Kill Chain\n\nLockheed Martin introduced the Cyber Kill Chain in 2011 and based it on the model of a military kill chain [1]. The fundamental premise of the Cyber Kill Chain model is that \"if any stage of the kill chain is blocked then the attack will not be successful\" [1]. The model has been used as a \"mental process guide\" to facilitate the deployment of preventative and protective tools [1]. \n\n\nSignificant overlap exists between the Cyber Kill\n\n\nActions on Objectives\n\nThe first four use the same terminology as the ATT&CK framework, while the last three divide up the remaining tasks somewhat differently. Notably, the maintenance phase from ATT&CK is not explicitly considered by the Cyber Kill Chain, which ends with the actions on objectives \"detonation stage\" [1].\n\n\nD. The STRIDE Framework\n\nThe STRIDE framework was developed by Microsoft and is an acronym for different types of exploitable security threats [13]. It proposes a five-phase method for threat analysis, which bears some resemblance to threat trees. The five steps of STRIDE are [13]:\n\nDecomposition Create data flow diagrams Analyze the data flow diagrams for threats Identification of vulnerabilities based on these threats\n\n\nDevelop mitigation approaches\n\nThe STRIDE process can be used to analyze both system elements and interactions. Notably, Kahn, et al. [13] suggest that element modeling may not be sufficient, in some cases, as some threats only become apparent when considering interactions. The six types of security threats that STRIDE was designed to aid with (and which form its acronym) are [13]:\nSpoofing Tampering Repudiation Information disclosure Denial of Services Elevation of Privilege E. Blackboard Architecture\nThe Blackboard Architecture provides the basis for the modeling implemented in BACCER. It was proposed for command decision making by Hayes-Roth [6] based on prior work on a speech recognition system [14]. The Blackboard Architecture has been used for a variety of different applications including robotics [15], the development of mathematical proofs [16], interpreting medical images [17] and testing software [18].\n\nThe blackboard architecture combines the rule-fact network structure of expert systems [19] with the concept of actions which allow the system to manipulate or interact with its environment. In [20], actions were used to trigger robotic data collection to facilitate exploration goal completion.\n\nA variety of expansions of the Blackboard Architecture have been proposed. Examples include expansions that facilitate concurrent operations [21] and communications [22].\n\n\nIII. COMPARISON OF THE FRAMEWORKS\n\nWhile the frameworks have some conceptual similarity and the Cyber Kill Chain and ATT&CK frameworks have significant overlap (as shown in Table 1), each framework has areas (amongst the set compared) unique to itself. An overview of these key areas of differentiation is presented in Table 2.\n\nThe simplest of the two frameworks to compare are Cyber Kill Chain and ATT&CK. The two have very similar steps. The Cyber Kill Chain framework explicitly recognizes the need for installation activities, after exploitation and before control activities can occur. Alternately, the ATT&CK framework explicitly recognizes the need for maintenance activities. Arguably, the maintenance activities and execution activities may be cyclic with maintenance activities being performed to keep the ability to execute against targets and the execution activities being performed as required. The STRIDE framework has similarities to the ATT&CK and Cyber Kill Chain frameworks. All three frameworks seek to analyze systems to identify weaknesses that are potentially exploitable. STRIDE also has three principle differences from the ATT&CK and Cyber Kill Chain frameworks. First, STRIDE is clearly defensively focused. While ATT&CK and the Cyber Kill Chain framework can be directly used for both offensive and testing-to-enhance-defense purposes, STRIDE is overtly defensive and lacks features required for direct offensive use. Notably, the STRIDE framework's first four steps could be plugged in to another framework to support data flow-based attack development. Versatility and a lack of specific definition allows these approaches to model things that don't follow a specific framework's model Second (though related to the first point), unlike ATT&CK and the Cyber Kill Chain framework, STRIDE doesn't actually have an explicit step or steps to deploy an attack against the targeted vulnerability. As shown in Table 3, STRIDE's first four steps are basically a data flow-driven expansion of the first two steps of the ATT&CK and Cyber Kill Chain frameworks. Notably, the fourth step of the STRIDE framework could be accomplished with offensive-self-testing style attacks. However, this isn't the only way that this step could be completed.\n\nThird, STRIDE explicitly incorporates a defensive step of mitigation. While the other frameworks can potentially be used for defensive use (in particular, under the assumption that an attack can be blocked by blocking any step in the attack progression), this use is not explicitly part of the step progression, like it is in STRIDE. \n\n\nPlan Mitigation Strategies\n\nA comparison of the ATT&CK, Cyber Kill Chain and STRIDE frameworks to the tree-based frameworks is inherently difficult, as the tree frameworks are highly flexible. Given this a key difference between the two is exactly this: the tree frameworks could potentially implement some, most or all of the three more specifically defined frameworks. The more specifically defined frameworks could also be used as part of a larger tree structure. For example, ATT&CK or Cyber Kill Chain could be used to identify potential vulnerabilities to then be assessed as part of a Threat Tree. Generally, though, ATT&CK and Cyber Kill Chain are most aligned with attack trees (which could implement parts or all of the frameworks). They could be used, with added mitigations, as part of attack trees with countermeasures and defense trees. STRIDE is also well suited to being fully or partially implemented with or as part of a defense tree and could clearly support the development of a threat tree for a particular piece or group of software that could be represented by data flows.\n\n\nIV. MODELING FRAMEWORKS WITH BACCER\n\nThis section builds on the review and comparison of the frameworks presented in the two subsequent sections. It demonstrates how each framework and components of frameworks can be implemented using the Blackboard Architecture.\n\nThis implementation has inherent similarities to the tree structures (threat, attack, defense, etc.). Thus, the tree structures will be implemented directly and serve as a conceptual model for the implementation of the ATT&CK, Cyber Kill Chain and STRIDE frameworks.\n\nFirst, tree structures are considered. Fig. 1 presents a basic example of a defense tree, which has been simplified to its core concept from [10]. In [10], the example tree was presented with two possible ways of entering (having keys and breaking in). Possible entry prevention and exit prevention and surveillance techniques specific to each were presented.\n\nThe tree presented in Fig. 1 demonstrates the concept of both attack and defense trees. The top-most three nodes would be members of an attack tree, while all nodes presented are members of the defense tree.\n\nThis same concept can be applied to a software system where a password replaces a key and password cracking replaces breaking down a door. This similar cyberspace scenario will be used to demonstrate how an attack and defense tree can be represented in a Blackboard Architecture Network. The basic scenario, mirroring the base scenario presented in Fig. 1, is presented in Fig. 2.\n\n\nServer Theft Entry Prevention\n\nExit Surveillance \n\n\nExit Prevention\n\n\nEntry Exit\n\n\nData Theft\n\nGaining Access To illustrate how this concept can be implemented in the Blackboard Architecture (and thus this part of the BACCER concept), one portion of this is challenge is illustrated in Fig. 3. Specifically, how a credential set could be used or obtained to access the network (equivalent to having or getting a physical key for the server room door lock example) is considered. Two key facts drive this, the credentials and the status of the credentials. If credentials exist and are known good, they are used. If they exist, but their status is unknown, then they are tested. Finally, if no credentials exist, an attempt to generate credentials is performed (e.g., searching for a username or using a common one and generating a password using password cracking techniques). A network of four facts (including one final fact; see [23] for a discussion of final facts), two rules and three actions is used to embody this logic and associated data and state storage. The three actions would have implementing code that performs the designated task and reports back the indicated data to the system.\n\n\nData Exfiltration\n\nIn generating a BACCER defense tree for this same scenario, one could model the attack tree and add defensive elements to it (as was demonstrated in [10] for the creation of the defense tree); however, this approach creates numerous facts that would have unknown or predicted states and is not a presentation that reflects what information a defender might have, how it would be processed or what a defender might do with this information. Instead, the attack tree is considered from the perspective of a defender and a Blackboard Architecture network is based upon this. This is presented in Fig. 4. Note that this network is the counterpart to the attack-perspective network that is shown in Fig. 3. No presumption about having access to the particular concept of attack that might be used is made.  In this case, the system begins with the system logs fact data and then performs an analysis action. The results of this action are run through three rules which look for whether a credential test (i.e., lots of login attempts with changing credentials), the use of credentials for potential validation purposes or the use of credentials from unusual actions have occurred. In the first case, if this results in a final successful login, hacker access is deemed to have occurred. The other two cases must be further investigated by the system before determining whether to assert the access obtained final fact.\n\nA threat tree for this same scenario would identify possible threat sources that could lead to the result of data theft. Fig. 5 presents an example, again focused on the credential attack component of the scenario.\n\n\nData Theft\n\nGaining Access The implementation of this using BACCER, which is not shown for purposes of brevity, would include data elements to represent knowledge about password strength, credential availability and internal threats. Actions would be included to collect this data and the data and rules would be implemented to perform risk analysis, based on a combination of the risk likelihood and risk impact, if it were to occur. and ATT&CK frameworks (based on information from [1], [2], [13]).\n\n\nData Exfiltration\n\n\nWeak Passwords\n\n\nAvailable Credentials\n\n\nInternal Threats\n\nFocus now turns to the implementation of the ATT&CK, Cyber Kill Chain and STRIDE frameworks. For the purposes of brevity, a single example will be used that combines all three. This is presented in Fig. 6.\n\nThe components of this combined framework are discussed in Section II and, thus, won't be discussed in detail here. Fig. 7 shows how the components that have been previously discussed can fit together into a combined Blackboard Architecture implementation. Logic between the first three phases and logic from the final four phases have been omitted and logic in the first two phases has been simplified for the purpose of brevity.\n\n\nV. CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK\n\nThis paper has presented the implementation of tree-based cybersecurity frameworks and the ATT&CK, STRIDE and Cyber Kill Chain frameworks with the Blackboard Architecture. The BACCER concept, which is demonstrated herein, can be further expanded with additional detail on numerous other types of attacks and defenses and with numerous other elements to facilitate the automation of attacks, defense and other operations.\n\nPlans for future work include the continued refinement of the BACCER model and its use implementation as part of several use case-targeted demonstration systems. In particular, a key area of future work will be the evaluation of the use of BACCER in several real-world scenarios and further exploration of its utility within the broader cybersecurity ecosystem.\n\n\nChain's seven phases and the MITRE ATT&CK framework's operational model.
