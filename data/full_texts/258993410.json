INTRODUCTION\n\nIn the pursuit of growing data capacities, ever increasing data rates and higher reliability of the communication link, future generations of communication networks aim towards millimeter waves and beyond. With this increase in operating frequency, new challenges arise due to increasing path loss, attenuation, absorption and the reduced diffraction [1]. As a consequence, challenges arise such as insufficient receive power in Non-Line-Of-Sight (LOS) scenarios or the lack of scatterers to create multipath (high-rank) [2]. One promising tool to overcome the aforementioned limitations are Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces (RIS). The fundamental idea behind a RIS is similar to that of a relay station, but without the need for any active transceiver circuits. Instead, an incoming EM wave is received and manipulated passively, such that it is spatially focused onto one or several desired focal spots (near-field) or directions (far-field). This working principle is illustrated in Fig. 1 in an exemplary non-LOS outdoor scenario. To achieve this, a RIS is composed of an array of radiating elements with independently adjustable phase states, regulated by an external control unit. Envisioned use cases for RIS cannot only be found in outdoor, but also in indoor communications [2], for instance in critical environments such as factories or hospitals, where stable connections between devices are indispensable. Moreover, the applicability of RIS is not limited to communication purposes, but also sensing applications as low rank remote monitoring [3] are part of the wide range of applications. In order to outperform decode-and-forward relays, arrays with large numbers of at least hundreds of radiation elements are envisoned [4]. For these large RIS, cost and power consumption are important factors. There are various technologies on how to enable the required phase shift of each radiation element, with PIN-Diodes being the most commonly used. However, these approaches are suitable only to a limited extent for large RIS as cost and power consumption increase significantly with size [5]. On top of that, only discrete phase shifts are possible leading to performance deteriorations such as gain reductions [6]. A promising alternative technology for millimeter wave RIS is microwave LC technology [7] with the potential of creating large scale RIS with comparably low power consumption and cost [5]. Potential disadvantages of LC-based RIS approaches are moderate insertion loss and comparably long response times in the range of milliseconds to seconds. Demonstrations are presented in previous works, although with 1-bit discrete phase shifts ( [8], [9], [10]). However, these realizations do not exploit the fact that LC can be tuned continuously between the two extreme states. On top of that, all mentioned approaches are based on reflectarrays, in which the antenna acts as radiating and phase shifting element simultaneously, leading to non-optimal performance in terms of bandwidth and response time [5]. In light of the above, this paper proposes the separation of radiating element and phase shifter for the realization of wideband, continuously tunable RIS elements. One challenge is to minituarize the phase shifter element down to less than 0.5\u03bb 0 being within the antenna element size. For this, the DGS-IMSL as proposed in [11] is investigated as a continuously tunable phase shifter. Besides miniaturization, the aim is to minimize insertion losses and response time, while maintaining the advantageous properties of LC-based RIS, i.e. very low power consumption, high linearity and low cost by using LCD technology for mass production [7]. The contribution is structured as follows. First, the RIS assembly, separating phase shifter and radiation element, is exemplified. In the next step, the DGS-IMSL is introduced and compared to a conventional inverted microstrip line (IMSL) approach. Afterwards, measurement results are shown and discussed and a conclusion is given.\n\n\nII. LIQUID CRYSTAL-BASED RIS\n\nA schematic of the liquid crystal-based RIS, which is the basis for this paper, is illustrated in Fig. 2. Here, a sector of 3x3 radiation elements is exemplified. A single element of the RIS is composed of a radiation element, which receives an EM wave and couples it to a phase shifter through a slot via aperture coupling. After the wave has travelled through the phase shifter, it is reflected at a termination and is back reflected towards the radiation element, to which it is coupled for retransmission. The electric length of each phase shifter is independently and continuously tunable. As with conventional antenna arrays, the goal in RIS realizations is to have a full 360 \u2022 phase tunability for each phase shifter, while remaining an element spacing close to 0.5\u03bb 0 x 0.5\u03bb 0 in order to enable wide angle beam steering capabilities without the occurence of grating lobes. This makes the choice for a suitable, compact phase shifter topology crucial, as the area for the phase shifter  is limited by the element spacing. However, it is important to note that, in contrast to a conventional transmitting array, the required length of the reflection type phase shifter is halved, as the wave travels twice through the phase shifter section.\n\n\nIII. DEFECTIVE GROUND STRUCTURE\n\nThe most conventional approach for the realization of planar LC-based tunable phase shifters is the IMSL [12]. As depicted in Fig. 3, it consists of an electrode, which is spatially separated from a ground plane with a distance of t LC . This parameter defines the thickness of the LC layer. The LC can be modelled as rod-like molecules due to its uniaxial characteristic. As illustrated in Fig 3 (a), the molecules are initially oriented perpendicular to the radio frequency (RF)field indicated by the red arrows. When a voltage is applied between electrode and ground as shown in Fig 3 (b), the molecules align with the developing bias field and are oriented in parallel to the RF-field. By changing the orientation of the molecules with respect to the RF-field, the relative permittivity is altered, enabling permittivity control by applying external bias voltages. With the commercially available liquid crystal GT7-29001 from Merck, which is used in this contribution, permittivity and loss correspond to \u03b5 r,\u22a5 = 2.45, \u03b5 r,\u2225 = 3.53, tan \u03b4 \u22a5 = 0.0116 and tan\u03b4 \u2225 = 0.0064 at 19 GHz [13]. The fringing fields\n\n# \u00bb E f reduce the tuning efficiency\n\u03b7 LC = \u03b5 r,eff,\u2225 \u2212 \u03b5 r,eff,\u22a5 \u03b5 r,\u2225 \u2212 \u03b5 r,\u22a5 ,(1)\nwith \u03b5 r,eff,\u2225 and \u03b5 r,eff,\u22a5 corresponding to the relative permittivities in the biased and the unbiased case. As the fringing fields in the fully biased case do correspond to the alignment of the molecules, \u03b5 r,\u2225 can be achieved. However, \u03b5 r,\u22a5 is not achievable as the fringing fields are not fully perpendicular to the LC molecules. Hence, the tuning efficiency is reduced [11]. An important measure to define the performance of LC based phase shifters is the Figure of Merit (FoM), which is defined as\nF oM = \u2206\u03d5 max IL max ,(2)\nwith \u03d5 max indicating the maximum phase shift and IL max the maximum insertion loss of the phase shifter at a specific frequency. The conventional IMSL features two main limitations. Firstly, for 180 \u2022 phase shift, space constraints, arising from the required 0.5\u03bb 0 element spacing, make bending of the IMSL unavoidable. Secondly, conductor losses increase significantly as t LC is decreased. However, the LC response time \u03c4 LC and particularly the switch-off response time, i.e. molecules turn from biased to unbiased state ( Fig. 3 (b) to Fig. 3 (a)) is critical. As \u03c4 LC shows a quadratic dependency with regard to the LC thickness t 2 LC , low thicknesses of several micrometers are desired in order to enable response times in the order of few tens of milliseconds [7]. Additionally, bias voltages also depend on the thickness of the LC layer. To overcome the aforementioned limitations, a LC-based phase shifter was proposed in [11], which introduces periodic defects to the metallic ground plane as illustrated in Fig. 4. The disturbance in the ground plane leads to an increase of inductance, as it extends the current path. This increased inductance features three main impacts: 1) The defects in the ground plane convert the IMSL to a DGS-IMSL, a filter with a lowpass response and slow-wave effect. This is illustrated in the plot in Fig. 5, which compares the simulation results of a DGS-IMSL and an IMSL with the same physical length and a thin LC layer thickness of t LC = 4.6 \u00b5m. While the transmitted power of IMSL and DGS-IMSL is similar below the DGS-induced cut-off, the group delay of the DGS-IMSL exceeds the group delay of the IMSL and increases approaching cut-off frequency, meaning that the electrical length of the phase shifter increases steeply. In other words, the closer the operation frequency lies to the cut-off the higher the compactness of the DGS-IMSL compared to a conventional IMSL, but at close proximity transmission declines rapidly.\nE V b E f t LC spacer V b (a) V b = 0 (a) V b = V Sat E E f w MS\n2) The DGS introduces the behaviour of a periodically loaded line, enabling thin LC layers with thicknesses of only a few \u00b5m, while maintaining acceptable conductor losses [14].\n\n3) According to the equation\nZ c = L C ,(3)\nwith L being the inductivity, C the capacity and Z C the line impedance, the width of the microstrip line must be widened with respect to a conventional microstrip line in order to remain a 50 \u2126 impedance. This is beneficial, as the tuning efficiency \u03b7 LC is increased due to the reduced influence of fringing fields, making the device even more compact.\n\n\nIV. MEASUREMENT RESULTS\n\nThe DGS-IMSL was fabricated using standard lithographic procedure as described in [15]. It has to be noted that the defects in the ground plane do not considerably increase the fabrication effort compared to an IMSL, as they are easily produced with one additional lithographic step. The fabricated DGS-IMSL is depicted in Fig. 6 (a) and (b) together with the fabricated coplanar to microstrip transition in (c), which enables on-wafer measurements as illustrated in (e). Measurements are conducted with a VNA Agilent Technologies PNA-X N5247A and I67-GSG-100 probes. The top and bottom substrates consist of 700 \u00b5m thick AF32 glass (\u03b5 r,AF32 = 5.1, tan\u03b4 AF32 = 0.009 at 24 GHz [16]). The ground plane and the electrode are electroplated with 2 \u00b5m thick gold. The measured transmission and reflection coefficients of the fabricated DGS-IMSL with a LC layer thickness of t LC = 4.6 \u00b5m and a length of 5082 \u00b5m (corresponds to This paper's copyright is held by the author(s).

Restrictions apply. \u2248 0.5 \u03bb 0 at 30 GHz) are illustrated in Fig. 7. Here, the two extreme cases of zero bias (V b = 0 V) and full bias (V b = 10 V) are exemplified. As expected, the cut-off for the fully biased state is located at a lower frequency due to the higher permittivity. The phase shifter features low reflection, |S 11 | < \u221214 dB, in the range between 25 and 33 GHz.\n\nAs the group delay grows approaching cut-off frequency, the differences in electric length depending on the permittivity increases. In other words, the closer to the cut-off, the higher the maximum obtainable phase shift. This behaviour is reinforced by the plot in Fig. 8. Here, the required length of the reflection-type phase shifter in terms of wavelength for a 180 \u2022 phase shift is illustrated. As the phase shifter is measured in transition, this value coincides with the length necessary for a RIS with full 360 \u2022 phase tunability. As frequency increases, the required length of the phase shifter is continuously decreased and falls below 0.5 \u03bb 0 at approximately 22.5 GHz, which is desired in order to avoid grating lobes. Near cut off, values as small as 0.25 \u03bb 0 are reached. Not only the length of the phase shifter, but also its FoM is an important metric to determine the overall performance. As illustrated in Fig. 9, similar to the compactness, the FoM improves approaching the cut-off frequency, reaching a FoM  of 79 \u2022 /dB at a frequency of 31 GHz. As soon as the DGSbased lowpass filter starts to attenuate the electromagnetic wave considerably, the FoM falls off rapidly.\n\n\nV. DISCUSSION\n\nAs summarized before, a phase shifter for a liquid-crystal based RIS should fulfill the following requirements:\n\n\u2022 High FoM \u2022 Compactness \u2022 Low response time In light of the above, the DGS-IMSL improves all of the aforementioned points in comparison with an IMSL as it enables compact, low-loss phase shifting with small LC thickness, leading to low response times. A comparison between a DGS-IMSL and an IMSL at 27.5 GHz with GT7-29001 can be found in table I. However, there are also challenges to be considered in terms of the DGS-IMSL. The group delay increases steeply close to cut-off, which is synonymous to the phase becoming non-linear. As a consequence, beamsquinting will occur for RIS applications. The closer the DGS-IMSL is operated near cut-off, the more distinctive the phase non-linearity becomes. Hence, there is a trade-off between FoM and compactness, which both improve approaching cut-off, on one side, and phase non-linearty on the other side. The impact of beamsquinting depends on the frequency bandwidth and the half power beamwidth desired for the application. Taking the aforementioned arguments into consideration, the DGS-IMSL is best suited when operated at frequencies close to cut-off, but not in immediate vicinity. Here, FoM and compactness have reached satisfactory results despite a slight increase in the phase shifter's non-linearity. For the exemplary phase shifter presented in this contribution, the best suited frequency range would hence be approximately 25 to 30 GHz.\n\n\nVI. CONCLUSION\n\nIn this paper, it has been demonstrated how a slow-wave DGS-IMSL can be used to reduce the required phase shifter length to only 0.35 to 0.45 \u03bb 0 for full 360 \u2022 tunability, while featuring a high FoM between 74 \u2022 /dB and 79 \u2022 /dB in the frequency range between 25 and 30 GHz. The thin LC layer of just 4.6 \u00b5m enables response times in the low millisecond range. As a summary, the DGS-IMSL is a very promising candidate for LC-based RIS applications due to its high FoM, wide bandwidth, compactness and easyness of fabrication.\n\n\nVII.
