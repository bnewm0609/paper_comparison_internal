At CES 2018, a total of 556 companies were active in the automotive and vehicle technology sector, including not only major automotive companies such as Ford, Mercedes-Benz, Toyota, and Hyundai, but also other Internet companies such as Amazon, Intel, NVIDIA and Cisco [16]. This area has become an explicit meeting point and a point of a partnership between traditional car manufacturers and the most prominent Internet companies [16]. Also, with considerable interests and developments in the Internet of Things (IoT), we can easily envisage this automotive technology being seamlessly connected to many other IoT devices, clouds, and other cyber-physical systems (CPS) via wireless and cellular networks. Nevertheless, when vehicles link to other networks, there may be periodic network attacks such as Denial-of-Service (DoS), packet injection, and spoofing attacks to target vehicle subsystems. Security researchers have discovered that cyberattacks are used to manipulate data inside the vehicle's internal control bus [15,28]. This vulnerability could allow the intruder to influence physical subsystems such as the steering wheel, engine, and brakes that could potentially endanger passengers or pedestrians. Additionally, new attack approaches will emerge that exploit particular protocol weaknesses in automotive technology. It is, therefore, necessary to plant and strengthen various parametric defense mechanisms throughout the vehicle to extenuate and mitigate cyberattacks.\n\nThe Controller Area Network (CAN) bus [32], which is a de-facto standard for serial communication, has been widely used for invehicle communication to provide an effective, stable and economic link between electronic control units (ECUs). The CAN bus is a broadcast-based networking protocol that allows a peak baud rate of up to 1 Mbps on a single bus built by Bosch in 1985. Due to its low prices, size, and functionality, most car manufacturers have embraced the CAN bus. However, due to its simplicity, there are several vulnerabilities in the CAN bus. As demonstrated by Lee et al. [15] and Song et al. [28], the receiving node does not verify the source of a CAN message; hence, many network traffic injection attacks are possible. As a result, numerous network attacks can be easily carried out and practically deployed on the CAN bus. Types of such attacks involve flooding the bus with messages meant to circumvent legitimate ones or using spoofed bus identifiers with invalid information. Additionally, there are far more sophisticated and stealthy attacks. These attacks seem to be legitimate-looking traffic sequences, and it is hard to distinguish them from regular traffic.\n\nTo address these challenges, we need to develop potent detectors and defense mechanisms and evaluate them against various types of intrusions. We propose CANTransfer, an intrusion detection method on Controller Area Network using Transfer Learning [27] based on Convolutional LSTM model [35]. The intuition is first to train the Convolution LSTM (ConvLSTM) based model with normal data as well as previously known intrusion dataset as a twoclass classification problem. After that, we use one-shot Transfer Learning [10] to re-train the model to detect new intrusion attacks. The reason for explicitly using Convolutional LSTM is that they have previously shown to capture better spatial-temporal details of the data as compared to LSTM based models, achieving high performance [30,35,36].\n\nWe evaluate our approach with CAN datasets collected from two different cars, KIA Soul and Hyundai Sonata, after driving more than 24 hours with ten different drivers [15,29].\n\nOur contributions are summarized below:\n\n\u2022 Novel attack detection architecture: We developed CAN-Transfer, a novel intrusion detection architecture based on ConvLSTM based model, which can detect attacks in multivariate time series data. CANTransfer can detect not only known attacks in a CAN bus but also is capable to detect unseen attacks via transfer learning. \u2022 Evaluation with real datasets: We evaluated the accuracy of our approach with the CAN dataset collected from two real vehicles, KIA Soul [34] and Hyundai Sonata [33]. We also compare our model with four other baseline models, and demonstrate that we achieve higher detection performance for both known (95.25% vs. 83.3%) and new attacks (88.47% vs. 58.78%) from the best baseline method. \u2022 Effectiveness of one-shot learning: In particular, we demonstrate a high accuracy using one-shot learning in detecting different variant of attacks, where our model only requires one sample amount of new intrusion samples to detect a new type of intrusion through various experiments.\n\nOur research shows highly promising results in detecting diverse types of severe vehicle attacks, and it can be integrated into a vehicle as an effective defense mechanism. Also, our approach will help reduce needs for collecting a massive amount of data for detecting each new type of network intrusion.\n\nThe remainder of this paper is organized as follows: In Section 2, we discuss the background and recent automotive security research directly relevant to our work. Details of our detection approach and algorithm are explained in Section 3. Then, we show our experiments and results in Section 4. We offer discussion and describe limitations in Section 5 and conclude in Section 6.\n\n\nBACKGROUND AND RELATED WORK\n\nController Area Network Bus. The version 2.0 of the Controller Area Network (CAN) specification is a broadcast-based communication protocol [2]. With embedded Electronic Control Units (ECUs) in modern cars, it is the primary means of communication.ECUs handle all aspects of car behavior, while cars typically have two CAN buses: the first type is a high-speed one (about 500Kbps), and the second type is a slower one (about 125Kbps) dedicated to passenger compartment functionality. Data is transmitted on the CAN bus in frames containing an arbitration ID, data payload (0-64 bits), and extra low-level bus control fields, as shown in Fig. 1. There are four types of the standard CAN frame in this protocol. (1) data frame for data transmission, (2) remote frame for asking a data frame for a destination node, (3) error frame for notifying an error in the currently transmitted frame, and (4) overload frame for delaying the next message until the current message is processed. The ID and the payload of data in a frame are used as main components to generate attacks in most circumstances. The ID is used for both identification and bus arbitration, where lower IDs are given higher priority when two ECUs simultaneously attempt to transmit. For example, '0000' is going to have top priority among all. The data frames, typically in a proprietary format, contain control commands and status information about the automobile state.\n\nIntrusion Detection on CAN bus. Cho and Shin [6] suggested a recursive least square algorithm to spot abnormalities within the in-vehicle network. Boudguiga et al. [3] explored the CAN protocol's lack of security mechanisms, making it susceptible to DoS, impersonation, and isolation attacks. They also suggested a simple method for CAN intrusion detection by making every microcontroller monitor in the CAN bus to detect malicious frames. Muter and Asaj [24] introduced the concept of entropy in the CAN bus and used it to detect anomalies through associating entropy with the reference set. The method is also more systematic and involves sensors to monitor the traffic status for the detection of anomalies. Our work is different from the above study, as we provide the algorithm for intrusion detection, which employs more fine-grained CAN frame features with better generalizability using transfer learning.\n\nChoi et al. [7] have suggested VoltageIDS that can secure CAN network in the vehicle. They mainly use the unique features of an electrical CAN signal in their work as an ECU fingerprint. Hoppe et al. [11,13] and Miller and Valasek [22] address the detection of intrusion in the vehicle using the number of messages sent over a CAN bus interval. Hoppe et al. [11,12] introduced simple attacks from the black box attack on an ECU gateway, enabling an attacker to sniff arbitrary internal communications and suggest an IT-Forensic intrusion detection system. Miller and Valasek [21,23] demonstrated they showed that they were able to take complete control over the automobile from a remote site by using the wireless network, provided the IP address of the vehicle is known. Also the degree of control needed for injecting messages onto the CAN bus and also suggested countermeasures.\n\nSong et al. [28] found that the interval of time between messages is changed during the attack, and they can detect anomalies using this information. Recently, Lee et al. [15] have shown that they can detect intrusions by using the offset response ratio and time interval of remote frames. We compared and demonstrated higher accuracy of our method compared to OTIDS [15]. Recently, Taylor et al. [31] have introduced an attack framework for automobiles that describes the characteristics of cyberattacks in the automotive. We analyzed attacks like a replay attack and found that more extended events can be identified more effectively than shorter ones. This paper combines Taylor and others' work for the replay attack generation. [31]. This paper incorporates the work by Taylor et al. [31] for the replay attack generation.\n\nConvolutional LSTM. Recently, considerable research studies have shown that deep learning for intrusion and anomaly detection on time series data is effective [29,30,35,36]. Detecting network intrusions in the CAN bus by utilizing both the rule-based and RNN approach showed the effectiveness of RNN in this domain [29]. Ensembling, the result from the rule-based method and RNN output result, was able to complement each other and detect different attacks that occurred on the bus with high accuracy. For generalpurpose sequence modeling, LSTM is used frequently as a special RNN structure. As an extension of LSTM, Shi et al. [35] introduced Convolutional LSTM (ConvLSTM) for nowcasting precipitation and other forecasting problems. ConvLSTM outperformed fully connected LSTM by having new convolutional structures in both inputto-state and state-to-state transitions. Another work by Zhang et al. [36] used ConvLSTM to detect anomalies in multivariate time series data. They proposed Multi-Scale Convolutional Recurrent Encoder-Decoder (MSCRED) which applies the attention-based ConvLSTM network to capture the temporal patterns. Even for practical operating applications such as Spacecraft multivariate sensor system anomaly detection, ConvLSTM has proved its efficiency and high performance [30]. In this paper, we utilize ConvLSTM to detect in-vehicle communication intrusion attacks by performing prediction on the multivariate stream.\n\nTransfer Learning. Training a neural network for classification tasks is usually done by training with the source dataset from scratch. Also, in many machine learning-based classification models, they assume that the training and testing data must be in the same domain space [26]. Transfer Learning enables the model to transfer knowledge to another unseen domain by reusing the weights from the source model of related tasks or domains [26]. Pratt [27] proposed Discriminability-Based Transfer (DBT) which utilizes predefined weights from the source and rescales the transferred weight with the target. This work demonstrates that DBT-initialized target networks learn significantly faster as compared to networks initialized randomly. Fei-Fei et al. [18] determined the effectiveness of transfer learning by proposing a framework that learns a representation across different domains in a label efficient way. They utilized a metric learning-based approach to simultaneously optimize with labeled source data and unlabeled or sparsely labeled data in the target domain. Another work from Fei-Fei et al. [10], 'One Shot Learning of Object Categories', coined the term one-shot learning and opened the new transfer learning research. Instead of training a classifier from scratch, this paper demonstrates that knowledge from previously learned categories can be used to train a novel category with one or a handful of images. This paper presented a variation on a Bayesian framework for representation learning for object categorization, which produces informative models when the \n\n\nOUR PROPOSED MODEL -CANTransfer\n\nWe develop the ConvLSTM-based CANTransfer to address the following research questions (RQs): (RQ1) Intrusion detection performance. Can ConvLSTM outperform over other state-of-the-art intrusion detection methods for CAN bus? (RQ2) Importance of preprocessing. Does the preprocessing and data transformation matter for intrusion detection performance? Which preprocessing method works the best for ConvLSTM? (RQ3) Transfer Learning. Does one-shot transfer learning increase the detection rate and more importantly, does it help in reducing the false-positives (FP)? (RQ4) Improvement from zero-shot. How does one-shot compare against zero-shot? (RQ5) False-positive. How does the FP-rate affect the performance? (RQ6) Processing Time. How much processing time does CANTransfer take to detect the intrusion in the worst-case scenario? (RQ7) Loss and Accuracy. Is the loss for the CANTransfer model converging with time, and how does the accuracy look like for transfer learning? In order to address these questions, we describe the details of CANTransfer in this section. CAN Traffic Analysis. In order to better understand normal CAN bus traffic during a standard car operation, we first studied high-speed CAN bus traffic. Such data helps us to recognize the regular and frequent CAN bus traffic. In order to understand their different behavior, we use two different cars, KIA Soul (car 1) and Hyundai Sonata (car2). We discovered that each car uses different frame IDs for the same operations; however, this comportment is anticipated as these cars are manufactured by different companies. There is, however, a high correlation between the occurrences and sequences of priority bits between Car 1 and 2. For example, in both vehicles, the sensor IDs used for the vehicle braking system vary, but they have a higher priority on the bus than other sensors.  Table 1 displays a sample of different CAN-packets where a column of 1 st represents packet-arrival time timeline, 2 nd column includes sender's ID (ECU), the total amount of bytes occupying a data field of the packet is indicated in the 3 rd column and the data field is shown in 4 th column. We observed various ID, DLC, and Data values for multiple CAN packets, as shown in Table 1. We found 45 unique sensor IDs for Car 1 and 29 unique frame IDs for Car 2, where each ID regularly transmits data between 10ms and 1s. Although most IDs had different data load values for the full scope of our data collection periods, a small group of data fields used in some IDs was almost unchanged. For example, ID '02c5' in Car 2 has a DLC of '8' (i.e., the data field contains 8 bytes) and 'ac 16 00 00 00 71 00 00' is a data field. We observed that in the whole dataset only the 4 th ,11 th and 12 th byte in the data field of '02c5' were changing and every other byte remained the same. The data field 'ac 19 00 00 00 e2 00 00' is another instance with ID value '02c5', which exhibited the same behavior. Additionally, several other IDs show similar patterns of operation on different bytes. These patterns are, therefore, useful for modeling the normal behavior of the CAN packet, then allow us to spot irregularities and target traffic. We used an algorithm by Markavitz and Wool [20] to obtain a more in-depth insight into the design of the CAN frames for examining information on the data field bits and classifying them further. This algorithm classify neighboring bits as (1) constant fields are those that are not changing, (2) multivalued fields are those that take a small number of relative values, and (3) sensor fields are those that take many different values. We also added a strict counter detector to the algorithm for IDs with non-recurring growing values by using the approach of Taylor et al. [31]. We categorized the sensor field by its variance, and we observed three clusters based on the number of unique field values that we named low (under 65), medium (between 115 and 475), and high (over 1800). For example, the IDs 0044, 051a and 0018 are low, 0587, 04f0 and 01f1 are medium, and 0153, 0220 and 0164 are high. These results are comparatively consistent with Taylor et al. [31] observations. After examining the normal CAN bus traffic sequences, we summarize our two main findings as follows:\n\n\u2022 The majority of the identifiers produce seemingly random data without any clear general representation, whereas there are some comparisons between the relative ordering of priorities in the identifiers. Moreover, the consistent creation of new data fields implies that data sequences can not be depicted as a univariate sequence of symbols, limiting the usefulness of most sequence-based anomaly detection methods.\n\n\nTimeser ies 2D Spatial Tr ansfor mation Preprocessed Dataset\n\nConvL STM M odel Figure 2: Dataset is transformed to be processed with the Convolutional LSTM model.\n\n\u2022 The static rate of the CAN bus frames in both cars allows detecting abnormalities and attacks at arrival rates using frequency-based algorithms.\n\nPreprocessing. The dataset in its natural state is not adequate for training a neural network-based method, so we have to perform some preprocessing. We split and transformed the original 4-feature dataset from Table 1 into an 11-features dataset, as shown in Table 2. The 'Time Diff. ' column is the difference between two consecutive timestamps formally known as an interpacket delay. The Data column is subdivided into eight columns (D1-D8), where each column contains two hexadecimal values. Also, the hexadecimal values in ID and Data columns (D1-D8) are converted to decimal values.\n\nTime series Transformation. We transformed the original dataset and constructed a multivariate time series. A multivariate time series data means we have multiple observations for each timestep. Now, we can develop a classifier, where input is time series and an output label dependent on the input time series (normal vs. attack). A LSTM model needs sufficient context to learn a mapping from an input sequence to an output value, and LSTM can support parallel input time series as separate variables or features. Therefore, we need to split the data into samples, maintaining the order of observations across the 11 features' input sequences. If we choose t input timesteps, then the sample will have this (t, 11) shape. If there are n samples generated from the dataset, then it will have a time series with the following (n, t, 11) shape as shown in Fig. 2.\n\n2D Spatial Transformation. Next, we transform our time series into a 2D space as shown in Fig. 2 to be preprocessed with a Convolutional LSTM. Hence, the timesteps t are divided into a two-dimensional multivariate time series where t r and t c represent the rows and column of this new space, as shown in Fig. 2. We applied a constraint on t to be even, so that after splitting t, we will always have equal size for t r and t c . Now, the data is ready to be processed by our Convolutional LSTM model.\n\nConvolutional LSTM. The core component of our intrusion detection approach uses a multivariate Convolutional LSTM (Con-vLSTM) [35]. By learning from the normal and abnormal data, the goal of our CANTransfer model is to predict between normal and abnormal sequences effectively via transfer learning. In our approach, a single model is created for an entire system. As observed by Hundman et al. [14], LSTMs struggles to accurately predict n-dimensional outputs with a large n, preventing the input of a multivariate stream into one or a few models. However, Convolutional LSTM (ConvLSTM) has shown to overcome these limitations, and thus it is suitable for predicting multivariate time series data as shown by [30,36]. In order to avoid overfitting, an early-stopping mechanism is applied when validation error starts increasing [4].\nConv L STM 2D Conv L STM 2D Conv L STM 2D Conv L STM 2D M odel I nput Conv L STM 2D Conv L STM 2D Conv L STM 2D Conv L STM 2D Conv L STM 2D Conv L STM 2D Conv L STM 2D Conv L STM 2D Conv L STM 2D Conv L STM 2D Conv L STM 2D Conv L STM 2D Conv L STM 2D Conv L STM 2D Conv L STM 2D Conv L STM 2D Conv L STM 2D Conv L STM 2D Conv L STM 2D Conv L STM 2D Conv3D Conv3D\nFully Connected 0 1 Figure 3: A graphical representation of our CANTransfer model. Fig. 3.\n\n\nA visual representation of our CANTransfer model is provided in\n\nMultivariate prediction. The dataset is transformed into a twodimensional spatial-temporal data X containing t historical values of each feature f . The length of the sequence t determines how far we look into the past for future predictions. The time series for some feature f i is given in Eq. (1):\nT (f i ) = { f i (t 1 ), f i (t 2 ), f i (t 3 ), . . . , f i (t n )},(1)\nwhere any f (t j ) is the jth step in the time series T (f i ). Hence, the timeseries for all 11 features can be written as follows:\nT f 1,...,n = {T (f 1 ) ,T (f 2 ) .T (f 3 ) , . . . ,T (f n )} (2)\nBy expanding Eq. (2) we obtain X , which is the input for CAN-Transfer model as shown in Fig. 4 Transfer Learning using CANTransfer. Deep learning methods are data-hungry by nature. Hence, they need massive amount of training examples to learn the weights. This data-hungry nature is one of the limiting aspects of deep neural networks. One-shot learning is a variant of transfer learning, where we aim to infer the required output based on just one or a few training examples. This characteristic is mainly helpful in real-world scenarios, where it is not easy to have labeled data for every intrusion attack as well as newly added intrusion classes, in addition to labels normal data. Once the CANTransfer model is fully trained, we use one-shot Transfer Learning [10]. The advantage of using one-shot learning is that we need to train only one example of a particular intrusion to successfully detect all instances of it. , Figure 4: The input and output representation for CAN-Transfer model.\n\n\nEXPERIMENTAL RESULTS\n\nWe conduct extensive experiments to answer the following seven research questions (RQ1-RQ7) described earlier.\n\n\nExperimental Setup\n\nCAN bus data. In order to better utilize the raw dataset of Car 1 and Car 2, we performed preprocessing and normalization on the dataset to produce 11 features. The timestamp is converted into time difference, which indicates the time interval between the current and previous packet. Next, we obtained eight subfeatures by dividing the data payload. For normalization, we divided payloads hex values with 'ff' which is the maximum value of the raw payload data. Labeling is performed by using timestep t. For example, if t is 16 packets and that window t is in \"Normal state duration\", all those windows' packets are labeled as 0 for normal traffic and 1 for intrusions. Table 2 shows the preprocessed and normalized dataset. Each packet has 11 features, and the last column is the label. The majority label in window t is given as the label of that t. We divided the collected dataset from each car to 70% for training (2,887,500 packets for Car 1 and 2,625,554 packets for Car 2), 25% for validation (1,031,250 packets for Car 1 and 937,698 packets for Car 2) and 5% for the testing of attack and anomaly detection model (206,250 packets for Car 1 and 187,539 packets for Car 2). Due to the comparatively slow data rate of the CAN bus, all the detectors can run in real-time speed; nevertheless, this might require the installation of dedicated hardware in a car. We tried different values between 2 \u2212 100 for input timestep t, where t is even.\n\nMachine Configurations. The PC specifications include Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-7700HQ CPU @ 2.80 GHz, NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1060 GPU and Linux 16.04 for the operating system. For developing the algorithm, we used Python 3.6 with the Keras library for deep learning methods by Chollet et al. [8] and TensorFlow [1].\n\nBaseline methods. We compared our CANTransfer method with four baseline methods as follow:\n\n\u2022 Threshold-based method: We conducted a direct comparison with the state-of-the-art OTIDS intrusion detection algorithm by Lee et al. [15], where OTIDS uses the offset ratio and time interval between request and response messages in CAN message to detect attacks.   \u2022 Classification-based models: We used One-Class SVM (OCSVM) [19] as a One-Class classification method and Isolation Forest (IF) [17]. Both of these methods learn the decision boundary from the training set. \u2022 Ensemble-based model: We also compared against a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) with Heuristics based approach (RNN + Heuristics) which is an ensemble of RNN with a threshold based method [29].\n\nWe use precision, recall, and F1-score for the evaluation and comparison. The input data representation for each of these baselines methods is different. Hence, we transformed and preprocessed dataset tailored for each baseline method.\n\nCANTransfer Training. First, we trained our Convolutional LSTM based CANTransfer model with normal data (class 0) and multiple instances of a known intrusion (class 1). The known intrusion, in our case, is a Denial of Service (DoS) attack. Next, we used our trained CANTransfer model and performed transfer learning by training with only one instance of a new intrusion (one-shot learning). The new intrusion can be a Fuzzing attack and a Replay attack, where a visual description of DoS, Fuzzing, and Replay attack is shown in Fig. 5. The reason for choosing the DoS attack as a known intrusion is that it is the most common intrusion and relatively straightforward for the model to learn it because of the high volume of attack traffic. Additionally, we designed our model to learn the underlying fundamental characteristics if the DoS attack, not over-fitting, and then adapted to other types of intrusion \n\n\nResults\n\n(RQ1) Intrusion detection performance. The precision, recall, and F1-score of different baseline methods against CANTransfer are reported in Table 3, where the highest performance values are highlighted in bold, and the best baseline performance values are indicated by underline. The \"Gain\" row in Table 3 reports the improvement of CANTransfer over the best baseline method. In Table 3, we observe that (a) after one-shot learning on our CANTransfer achieves higher precision (87.97%), recall (88.97%) and F1-score (88.47%) for 'new' intrusions as compared to threshold (OTIDS), Classification (IF, OCSVM) and Prediction (RNN+Heuristics) based models. Isolation Forest (IF) and OneClass SVM (OCSVM) show low precision and high recall, indicating that most of the predicted labels are incorrect (false-positives) when compared to the training labels. (b) It is interesting to note that with slightly lower F1-Score (95.25%) than the best baseline method (99.09%) on known intrusions, our CANTransfer model became better at generalizing the intrusion behavior after one-shot learning as shown in column 'F1score (New)' in Table 3. CANTransfer show that it can detect most of the intrusions with a very few numbers of false-positives, as shown in Table 3.\n\n(RQ2) Importance of preprocessing. In our experiments, we tried two different methods of training our CANTransfer method. In the first method, we did not perform any preprocessing or spatial transformation on the raw dataset and allowed to model to train on raw data. In the second method, we preprocessed the dataset and the applied 2D spatial transformation, as described in Section 3. The results are very drastically different in favor of the second method by 72.54% in gain on F1-score, which is what we were expecting. Due to space limitation, we do not present the whole result.\n\n(RQ3) Transfer Learning. From Table 3, we can observe that the F1-Score (88.47%) of CANTransfer for new intrusions was increased by 26.69% after applying transfer learning as compared to F1-Score (58.78%) of the best baseline (RNN+Heuristics). As shown in Table 4, the false-positive rate for CANTransfer decreased as the precision and recall score for intrusions (class 1) increase from 67.0% (precision) and 0.00% (recall) in zero-shot learning to 81.0% (precision) and 83.0% (recall) in one-shot learning. Therefore, CAN-Transfer achieved a gain of 81.0% in F1-score.\n\n(RQ4) Improvement from zero-shot. We also compared the performance of CANTransfer with zero-shot learning, where not even a single sample of new intrusion is given to the model during its training. The comparison can be seen in Table 4. The F1-score for class 0 (91.0%) and Class 1 (82.0%) on new intrusion with one-shot learning is far better than the F1-score for Class 0 (81.0%) and class 1 (1.00%) on new intrusion with zero-shot learning.\n\n(RQ5) false-positives. From Table 4, we can observe that the precision for known intrusion is very high for both zero-shot (Class 0: 99.0%, Class 1: 99.0%) and one-shot learning (Class 0: 99.0%, Class 1: 90.0%). However, for new intrusions, there is a significant difference the precision of zero-shot (Class 0: 68.0%, Class 1: 67.0%) and one-shot learning (Class 0: 92.0%, Class 1: 81.0%). This difference represents the decrease in the false-positives rate after one-shot learning is applied, which shows the effectiveness of CANTransfer.\n\n(RQ6) Processing Time. Processing time is a considerable concern in real-time systems. Hence, a method that takes a lot of processing time, will never be feasible. During our experiments, we also checked the processing time of each prediction request sent to CANTransfer. To keep the processing time to minimal, we wanted a very small timestep (window size) t. We experimented with multiple sizes of t and concluded that t =16 is the right size as any window size larger than 16 has very similar performance on CANTransfer. We also experimented with timestep t from 1-50 and observed that all of the prediction requests were quickly processed in real-time.\n\n(RQ7) Loss and Accuracy. In order to prove that the training process is stable and it will always converge, we ran the same experiments for multiple times and reported the average case and best case. From Fig. 6, we can observe that for both the best and average case, the CANTransfer loss values are very similar. The same goes for the accuracy values as well. This similarity demonstrates that the model will generally perform in the same manner. We can also observe from Fig.6, that the loss and accuracy of CANTransfer converge to the same point even after one-shot learning. This shows that our CANTransfer has successfully learned about the new intrusion via one-shot learning, while maintaing the knowledge of previously known intrusions.\n\n\nDISCUSSION AND LIMITATIONS\n\nWhat types of proactive actions and countermeasures should be performed after detecting different types of attacks? Although we did not consider in the current research, we believe that an integrated safety and defense system can be developed, providing the following additional countermeasures after detecting an intrusion: (1) Automatically put the car to safety mode. (2) Slow down the car and alert the driver. (3) Send it the attack signature to the cloud for further analysis. For example, a service such as General Motors subscription-based communications, in-vehicle security, emergency services, hands-free calling, turn-by-turn navigation, and remote diagnostics systems known as OnStar [25] can be alerted on detecting an intrusion attack. Another critical factor is the effects of delay in detecting the intrusion on properties such as stability and safety of cars. In this work, we considered the processing time (delay in detection) of our CANTransfer method. In our experiments, we were able to perform intrusion detection in real-time. The processing time for the analysis of packets is kept to a minimum, which enables our proposed approach to detect intrusions in real-time. However, there can be some implications, when implementing such systems in a real-world environment, and more research is required on the implementation side.\n\nDuring the vehicle operation, intrusions can be dangerous threats and have real serious ramifications and harm to a driver, passengers, pedestrians, and a vehicle. New intrusions are discovered every month, and it is hard to train a neural network for new intrusion until we have a significant amount of data. Hence, we proposed CANTransfer, the first line of defense against new intrusion attacks using one-shot transfer learning. We demonstrate the effectiveness of CANTransfer in detecting the new intrusions. For future research, CANTransfer can be implemented, deployed, and tested in actual vehicle systems and detection performance can be compared. In addition, we should consider the actionable and proactive attack mitigation strategy after detection of different intrusions.\n\nFigure 1 :\n1CAN Bus Frame Format\n\nFigure 5 :\n5Network-based attacks in CAN bus.\n\nFigure 6 :\n6(c) CANTransfer performs the best among all the evaluated methods, yielding an overall F1-score of 95.25% and 88.47% for known and new intrusions. The gain of our approach over the best baseline (RNN+Heuristics) measured up to 26.69% in F1-score. (d) A high recall (88.97%) and precision (87.97%) score of Loss (left) and Accuracy (right) of CANTransfer during training.\n\nTable 1 :\n1Sample CAN packets, showing different ID and DLC fields number of new training examples is extremely small. Cozzolino et al.[9] also used a similar concept of transfer learning to detect fake or forged images from multiple manipulation approaches. When training with data from one specific forgery method, they show that Convolutional Neural Networks detect examples extremely well. Their work uses the auto encoder-structured model, Forensic-Transfer, which enforces activations in different parts of a latent vector from the encoder for the real and fake classes. The learned latent vector acts as a form of anomaly detector. ForensicTransfer shows significant improvements in transferability by training from source and transfer learn the same model to a minimal target dataset. Similarly, our CANTransfer trains the model with known intrusion, and then transfer learns to new intrusion. However, our approach uses ConvLSTM to detect attacks in time series.Timestamp \nID \nDLC \nData \n1479246664.162438 0153 \n8 \n00 21 10 ff 00 ff 00 00 \n1479246664.164967 02b0 \n5 \nbd ff 00 07 dc \n1479246664.165822 043f \n8 \n00 40 60 ff 58 28 08 00 \n1479246664.171065 05f0 \n2 \nf4 00 \n1479246664.171695 0002 \n8 \n00 00 00 00 00 06 01 a2 \n\n\n\nTable 2 :\n2Representation of the dataset after preprocessing.Labels are normal (0) and intrusion(1).Time \nDiff. \n\nID DLC \n\nData \nLabel \nD1 \nD2 \nD3 \nD4 \nD5 \nD6 \nD7 \nD8 \n0.6 \n497 \n8 \n0 \n0.501 0.062 \n1 \n0 \n1 \n0.815 0.368 \n0 \n0.4 \n544 \n8 \n0 \n0 \n0 \n0 \n0 \n0 \n0 \n0 \n0 \n0.6 \n848 \n8 \n0.874 0.011 0.996 0.011 0.035 \n0 \n0.227 0.062 \n0 \n. . . \n. . . \n. . . \n. . . \n. . . \n. . . \n. . . \n. . . \n. . . \n. . . \n. . . \n. . . \n\n0.2 \n399 \n8 \n0.019 0.141 0.368 0.054 0.141 0.101 \n0 \n0.498 \n1 \n0.1 \n128 \n8 \n0 \n0.109 0.141 \n0 \n0 \n0.356 \n0 \n0.062 \n1 \n\n\n\nTable 3 :\n3Performance comparison of CANTransfer with the \nbaseline methods.
