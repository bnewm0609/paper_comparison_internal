In Section 2 we recall the fundamental results about the slices in the affine Grassmannian. In Section 3 we do the main computation, the quantum multiplication by a divisor. In Section 4 we show how the result from Section 3 matches with the trigonometric Knizhnik-Zamolodchikov equation if one introduces appropriate identification with objects from representation theory. Finally, in Appendix A and Appendix B we summarize the results about T-invariant curves and families of deformations that we use in the main text.\n\nIntroduction\n\n\nOverview\n\nThe central object in this work is the moduli space called the affine Grassmannian Gr. It is associated to a complex connected reductive group G, and one can think of it as an analogue of flag varieties for a corresponding Kac-Moody group. It is known to have deep connections with representation theory and Langlands duality [G,MV,MV2]. More precisely, the geometric objects we study are transversal slices in affine Grassmannians. To give an idea of what these slices are, recall that the affine Grassmannian Gr has a cell structure similar to the Schubert cells in the ordinary flag variety. A transversal slice Gr \u03bb \u00b5 describes how one orbit is attached to another. The slices Gr \u03bb \u00b5 first appeared in mathematical physics as Coulomb branches in supersymmetic theories [SW]. They are naturally algebraic Poisson varieties and, in some cases, admit a smooth symplectic resolution Gr \u03bb \u00b5 \u2192 Gr \u03bb \u00b5 , which is a notion of independent mathematical interest [K2, K3,BK]. The goal of this work is to study the quantum cohomologies of these resolutions.\n\nOne of our motivations is 3d mirror symmetry. It is known to exchange the Coulomb (X) and the Higgs branch (X \u2228 ) of vacuua in a 3d supersymmetric field theory [IS, SW]. In [MO2] D. Maulik and A. Okounkov studied the quantum cohomology for Nakajima quiver varieties [N2,N,N3], symplectic resolutions which naturally arise as the Higgs branch of vacua X \u2228 . Mirror symmetry is a source of conjectural relations between the enumerative geometry of X and X \u2228 , and understanding the Coulomb side makes it possible to verify this relation directly.\n\nIn this project the main algebraic structure which captures the enumerative geometry of X is the (equivariant) quantum cohomology QH * T (X). It is a deformation of usual (equivariant) cohomology by curve counts called Gromov-Witten invariants. The multiplication in QH * T (X) for symplectic resolutions X \u2192 X 0 gives rise to an interesting flat connection with base H 2 (X) and fiber H * T (X), called the quantum connection. It appears as a differential equation on important generating functions in enumerative geometry. The quantum connection was identified with well-known representationtheoretic connections for some symplectic resolutions. For the case of Nakajima quiver varieties this connection was computed in [MO2], for the Hilbert scheme or A n resolution in [MO], for the cotangent bundle of a flag variety in [S]. Here we identify the quantum connection in the case of resolutions of slices of the affine Grassmannian Gr \u03bb \u00b5 , with the trigonometric Knizhnik-Zamolodchikov connection coming from the representation theory of a reductive group G \u2228 . Moreover, the group G in the 1 definition of Gr and G \u2228 in the Knizhnik-Zamolodchikov equations turn out to be Langlands-dual, which is natural because of Langlands nature of the geometry of Gr.\n\nThe identification of the quantum connection with the Knizhnik-Zamolodchikov equations recently plays an important role in the project of M. Aganagic [A, A2]. One of the goals of this project is to provide a new approach to categorified knot invariants. The appropriate category on the B-side of mirror symmentry is the derived category of coherent sheaves on Gr \u03bb \u00b5 , and the K-theoretic vertex functions satisfy the quantum differential equation. If we know that it coincides with the Knizhnik-Zamolodchikov equation, as we show in this paper, then we are sure that the monodromies act on K-theory of Gr \u03bb \u00b5 exactly as R-matrices in quantum link invariants [RT, W]. Hence, the categorified braid group action on the derived category of Gr \u03bb \u00b5 specializes under decategorification to the wellknown link invariants.\n\n\nOverview of the main result\n\nQuantum (equivariant) cohomology is a deformation of ordinary equivariant cohomology by threepoint Gromov-Witten invariants. We define it by the following formula \u03b3 1 , \u03b3 2 * \u03b3 3 = \u03b3 1 , \u03b3 2 \u222a \u03b3 3 + d\u2208H eff 2 (X,Z) \u03b3 1 , \u03b3 2 , \u03b3 3 0,3,d q d for any \u03b3 1 , \u03b3 2 , \u03b3 3 \u2208 H * T (X). Here \u2212, \u2212, \u2212 X 0,3,d are genus zero three-point degree d equivariant Gromov-Witten invariants and q is a formal parameter. We refer to the extra terms in this formula as purely quantum part.\n\nIn this work the spaces of interest are resolutions of slices of the affine Grassmannian X = Gr \u03bb \u00b5 which are parametrized by a reductive group G, a sequence of minuscule coweights \u03bb = (\u03bb 1 , . . . , \u03bb l ) and a dominant coweight \u00b5. The quantum connection requires the quantum multiplication of special kind, when \u03b3 3 is a divisor, i.e. \u03b3 3 = D \u2208 H 2 T (X). To simplify the problem, we can apply the divisor equation [HKK + ]:\n\n\u03b3 1 , \u03b3 2 , D X 0,3,d = D, d \u03b3 1 , \u03b3 2 X 0,2,d . We compute the purely quantum part in this paper. The main idea follows [BMO], it's the reduction to the wall cases. Let us outline what we use to do it.\n\n\nStable basis and purely quantum multiplication\n\nThe first step is to construct a basis in the equivariant cohomology H * T (X) which is easy to work with. One of the choices naturally comes after localization, i.e. passing to a related algebra\nH * T (X) loc = H * T (X) \u2297 H * T (pt) Frac H * T (pt) ,\nwhere Frac H * T (pt) is the fraction field. In all the spaces X we consider, the fixed locus X T is a finite set of points. This allows us to define a basis by pushing forward the units 1 p \u2208 H * T (p), p \u2208 X T under inclusions i p : p \u0592\u2192 X. The localization Theorem of Atiyah-Bott [AB] implies that this is a basis, called the fixed point basis.\n\nThe fixed point basis was used by M. Viscardi in his PhD thesis [V] to compute the purely quantum multiplication in the first nontrivial case, i.e. when \u03bb is a sum of two minuscule coweights, and only in the leading order. This computation shows the limitation of this approach. Viscardi computed only the leading term in the purely quantum part of the multiplication and finding the correction terms looks extremely hard if even possible.\n\nThe way how we overcome this obstacle and protect ourselves from corrections is to use nonlocalized classes and rely heavily on dimensional arguments to have an automatic vanishing of corrections. Using pushforward classes i p, * 1 is not enough because of their high degree, 2 dim X. Such a degree still allows our formulas to have barely computable corrections. This is why we use the stable basis Stab \u01eb C (p) introduced in [MO2], which has degree dim X. It is also given by the images of 1 p \u2208 H * T (p), but under a different map, going in the \"wrong\" way Stab \u01eb C : H * T X A \u2192 H * T (X) .\n\nThe main choice one has to make is the choice of attracting directions in a torus, which is denoted here by C as a Weyl chamber. Informally, the classes Stab \u01eb C (p) are \"corrected\" versions of the (Poincar\u00e9 dual) fundamental classes of the attracting varieties to p. The notion of attracting variety clearly depends on a choice of C.\n\nWe use the classes Stab \u01eb C (p) for our computations. Strictly speaking, these form a basis only after localization, but we still refer to these classes as the stable basis.\n\nThese classes behave well for symplectic resolutions. If we have a (T-equivariant) symplectic resolution (X, \u03c9) X \u2192 X 0 of an affine Poisson variety X 0 , then it is known [KV] to have a universal family of deformations of a pair (X, \u03c9)\nX X u 0 H 2 (X)(1)\nwhere the base can be identified with the second cohomology of X. Then the stable envelopes naturally extend to this family. In a certain sense they are invariant under such deformations. If X is a conical symplectic resolution, then we have two simplifications:\n\n\u2022 The two-point Gromov-Witten invariants are divisible by :\n\n\u03b3 1 , \u03b3 2 X 0,2,d = 0 mod .\n\n\u2022 The off-diagonal restrictions of the stable envelopes are divisible by : \u03b9 * q Stab \u01eb C (p) = 0 mod .\n\nIf we take \u03b3 1 = Stab \u01eb \u2212C (q) and \u03b3 2 = Stab \u01eb C (p) then by dimension argument\nStab \u01eb \u2212C (q) , Stab \u01eb C (p) X 0,2,d \u2208 Q\nThen one can reduce the computation of these invariants to the localization with respect to subtorus A = ker . As said above, almost all restrictions of stable envelopes vanish and the computation becomes similar to the computation of the leading term in the fixed point basis.\n\nIn Section 3 we do this computation following the method of A. Braverman, D. Maulik and A. Okounkov [BMO] of reducing the enumerative problem to contributions of walls in K\u00e4hler parameters, that is, in the base of the family (1).\n\nThe following explicit formula\nc T 1 (E i ) * q Stab \u01eb C (p) = \u2212 i<j Stab \u01eb C q ei\u2212ej 1 \u2212 q ei\u2212ej \u2126 ij st,\u01eb (p) + q 2(ei\u2212ej ) 1 \u2212 q 2(ei\u2212ej ) \u2126 ij lg,\u01eb (p) + j<i Stab \u01eb C q ej \u2212ei 1 \u2212 q ej \u2212ei \u2126\n\nIdentification\n\nCombining the results on purely quantum multiplication with the classical multiplication in [D], we get for a simply-laced G\nc T 1 (E i ) * Stab \u01eb C (p) = Stab \u01eb C \uf8ee \uf8f0 H i (p) + j =i q ei \u2126 ij C,\u01eb (p) + q ej \u2126 ij \u2212C,\u01eb (p) q ei \u2212 q ej \uf8f9 \uf8fb \u2212 Stab \u01eb C \uf8ee \uf8f0 j<i q ej K ij (p) q ei \u2212 q ej + j>i q ei K ij (p) q ei \u2212 q ej \uf8f9 \uf8fb ,(2)\nThis formula is a power series via the expansion in the region chosen with respect to the effective cone\nH eff 2 (X) \u2282 H 2 (X) q e1 \u226a q e2 \u226a \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u226a q e l .\nThe quantum connection is a connection on a vector bundle over an open part of H 2 T (X) with a fiber H * T (X). The of sections of these bundle in a formal neighbourhood can be identified with QH * T (X). Then the quantum connection is given by the following formula\n\u2207 Q D = \u2202 D \u2212 D *\nfor the tangent vector in the base D \u2208 H 2 T (X). Taking into account the formula (2), we see that it looks similar to the trigonometric Knizhnik-Zamolodchikov connection (see [EFK], for example). Explicitly one can write it as a family of commuting differential operators\n\u2207 KZ i = z i \u2202 \u2202z i \u2212 H i \u2212 j =i z i \u2126 ij C + z j \u2126 ij \u2212C z i \u2212 z j on the space C[ ](z 1 , . . . , z l ) \u2297 V 1 \u2297 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u2297 V l\nor, more geometrically, a flat connection on sections of a certain vector bundle over a base with coordinates z i . The trigonometric Knizhnik-Zamolodchikov connection appeared in conformal field theory [KZ] and representation theory of affine Lie groups [EFK].\n\nThe terms with K ij in (2) can be removed by applying a gauge transform. Then the main thing remaining in the identification of the operators \u2126 ij C,\u01eb and H i with \u2126 ij C and H i . To do it we first have to identify variables, spaces and parameters on both sides.\n\nTo make the identification with the quantum connection of Gr \u03bb \u00b5 , we take the representations V i to be V \u03bbi , the irreducible finite dimensional representations with highest weight \u03bb i . Moreover, we restrict the tensor product to the subspace of weight \u00b5\nC[ ](z 1 , . . . , z l ) \u2297 V \u03bb1 \u2297 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u2297 V \u03bb l .\nThen we identify similar objects on two sides:\nTrigonometric KZ Quantum z i q ei Expansion region |z i | \u226a |z j | Effective cone e i \u2212 e j > 0 Choice of C in \u2126 C Choice of C in Stab C Basis v \u00b51 \u2297 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u2297 v \u00b5 l\nStable envelopes Stab C (p)\n\n\nSlices of the affine Grassmannian\n\nIn this chapter we recall some facts about slices of the affine Grassmannians.\n\n\nRepresentation-theoretic notation\n\nLet us present notation we use for common representation-theoretic objects. One major difference from standard notation is that we use non-checked notation for coobjects (coweights, coroots, etc) and checked for ordinary ones (weighs, roots, etc). This is common in the literature on affine Grassmannian since it simplifies notation. And unexpected side effect is that weights in equivariant cohomology will have checks. We hope this won't cause confusion.\n\n\u2022 G is a connected simple complex group unless stated otherwise,\n\n\u2022 A \u2282 G is a maximal torus,\n\u2022 B \u2283 A is a Borel subgroup,\n\u2022 g is the Lie algebra of G \u2022 X * (A) = Hom(C \u00d7 , A) is the cocharacter lattice,\n\n\u2022 X * (A) + \u2282 X * (A) the submonoid of dominant cocharacters.\n\n\u2022 \u039b \u2283 X * (A) is the coweight lattice, \u039b = X * (A) if G is adjoint type.\n\u2022 W = N (A)/A is the Weyl group of G, \u2022 g = h \u2295 \u03b1 \u2228 g \u03b1 \u2228 is the root decomposition of g.\n\u2022 \u03c1 \u2228 is the halfsum of positive roots.\n\n\u2022 K (\u2022, \u2022) Weyl-invariant scalar product on coweight space \u039b \u2297 Z R, normalized in such a way that for the shortest coroot the length squared is 2 (equivalently, the length squared of the longest root is 2).\n\nWe identify all weights with Lie algebra weights (in particular we use additive notation for the weight of a tensor product of weight subspaces).\n\n\n5\n\n\nAffine Grassmannian\n\nLet O = C[[t]] and K = C((t)). We will refer to D = Spec O and D \u00d7 = Spec K as the formal disk and the formal punctured disk respectively. Let G be a connected reductive algebraic group over C. The affine Grassmannian Gr G is the\nmoduli space of \uf8f1 \uf8f2 \uf8f3 (P, \u03d5) P is a G-principle bundle over D, \u03d5 : P 0 | D \u00d7 \u223c \u2212 \u2192 P| D \u00d7 is a trivialization of P over the punctured disk D \u00d7 \uf8fc \uf8fd \uf8fe(3)\nwhere P 0 is the trivial principal G-bundle over D. It is representable by an ind-scheme.\n\nOne can give a less geometric definition of the C-points of the affine Grassmannian\nGr G (C) = G (K) /G (O)(4)\nwhere we use notation G (R) for R-points of the scheme G given a C-algebra R. We will use this point of view when we talk about points in Gr G . The see that these are exactly the C-points of Gr G (i.e. the pairs (P, \u03d5) as in (3)), note that on D any G-principle bundle is trivializable, so take one trivialization \u03c8 : P 0 \u223c \u2212 \u2192 P. This gives a composition of isomorphisms\nP 0 | D \u00d7 \u03c8| D \u00d7 \u2212\u2212\u2212\u2192 P| D \u00d7 \u03d5 \u22121 \u2212\u2212\u2192 P 0 | D \u00d7(5)\nwhich is a section of P 0 | D \u00d7 , i.e. an element of G (K). Change of the trivialization \u03c8 precomposes with a section of P 0 , in other words, precomposes with an element of G (O). This gives a quotient by G (O) from the left.\n\nWe restrict ourselves to the case of connected simple (possibly not simply-connected) G in what follows without loosing much generality. Restating the results to allow arbitrary connected complex reductive group is straightforward.\n\nFrom now on we fix a connected simple complex group G. Since it can't cause confusion, we omit later G in the notation Gr G and just write Gr.\n\nThe group G (K) \u22ca C \u00d7 naturally acts on Gr. In the coset formulation the G (K)-action is given by left multiplication and C \u00d7 -acts by scaling variable t in K with weight 1. In the moduli space description G (K) acts by changes of section g \u00b7 (P, \u03d5) = P, \u03d5g \u22121 (these two actions are the same action if one takes into account identification (5)), C \u00d7 scales D such that the coordinate t has weight 1. We will later denote this C \u00d7 as C \u00d7 when we want to emphasize that we use this algebraic group and its natural action.\n\nWe will need actions by subgroups of this group, namely A \u2282 G \u2282 G (O) \u2282 G (K). It will also be useful to consider extended torus T = A \u00d7 C \u00d7 , where C \u00d7 part comes from the second term in the product G (K) \u22ca C \u00d7 .\n\nThe canonical projection T \u2192 C \u00d7 gives a character of T which we call (this explains the subscript in the notation C \u00d7 ). Then the weight of coordinate t on D is by the construction of the C \u00d7 -action.\n\nRemark. We call the maximal torus of G by A to have notation similar to [MO2], i.e. T is the maximal torus acting on the variety, and A is the subtorus of T preserving the symplectic form.\n\nThe partial flag variety G/P (where P is parabolic) has a well-known decomposition by orbits of B-action called Schubert cells. The affine Grassmannian has a similar feature.\n\nOne can explicitly construct fixed points of the A-action. Given a cocharacter \u03bb : C \u00d7 \u2192 T, one can construct a map using natural inclusions\nD \u00d7 \u0592\u2192 C \u00d7 \u03bb \u2212 \u2192 T \u0592\u2192 G\ni.e. an element of G (K). Projecting it naturally to Gr we get an element [\u03bb] \u2208 Gr. These points are A-fixed and even the following stronger statements are true.\n\nProposition 2.1.\n\n\nGr\nA = \u03bb\u2208X * (A) {[\u03bb]} 2. Moreover, Gr T = Gr A\nUsing these elements we define\nGr \u03bb = G (O) \u00b7 [\u03bb]\nas their orbits. These have the following properties Proposition 2.2.\n\n1. For any w \u2208 W one has Gr w\u03bb = Gr \u03bb .\n\n2. Gr = \u03bb\u2208X * (A)+ Gr \u03bb 3. Gr \u03bb = \u00b5\u2264\u03bb \u00b5\u2208X * (A) + Gr \u00b5 4. As a G-variety, Gr \u03bb is isomorphic to a the total space of a G-equivariant vector bundle over a partial flag variety G/P \u2212 \u03bb with parabolic P \u2212 \u03bb whose Lie algebra contains all roots \u03b1 \u2228 such that \u03b1 \u2228 , \u03bb \u2264 0.\n\n5. D-scaling C \u00d7 in T scales the fibers of this vector bundle over G/P \u2212 \u03bb with no zero weights.\n\n6. Gr \u03bb is the smooth part of Gr \u03bb . In particular, Gr \u03bb is smooth iff \u03bb is a minuscule coweight or zero.\n\nCorollary 2.3. Gr admits a T-invariant cell structure.\n\nProof. Each G/P \u2212 \u03bb admits an A-invariant cell structure, namely Schubert cells. A-equivariant vector bundles over these cells give A-invariant cells for each of Gr \u03bb . Hence we have an A-invariant cell structure for Gr.\n\nMoreover this cell structure is invariant under D-scaling C \u00d7 -action, because it just scales the fibers of the vector bundles. Finally, we get that this cell decomposition T-invariant.\n\nCorollary 2.4. Orbits of diagonal G (K)-action on Gr \u00d7 Gr are in bijection with dominant cocharacters.\n\nProof. First recall that for any group H and a subgroup K one has a bijection H-diagonal orbits of\nH/K \u00d7 H/K \u2243 K\\H/K \u2243 K-orbits of H/K\nApplying this for H = G (K) and K = G (O) and that the rightmost set is in bijection with dominant cocharacters by Proposition 2.2 we get the statement.\nWe write L 1 \u03bb \u2212 \u2192 L 2 if (L 1 , L 2 ) \u2208 Gr \u00d7 Gr is in the G (K)-orbit indexed by a dominant \u00b5 \u2264 \u03bb.\nRemark. Explicitly, one says that L 1\n\u03bb \u2212 \u2192 L 2 iff picking representatives L 1 = g 1 G (O), L 2 = g 2 G (O) with g 1 , g 2 \u2208 G (K) we have\n\nTransversal slices\n\nAs one can see, elements g(t) of G (O) \u2282 G can be characterized as the elements of g(t) \u2208 G (K) such that lim t\u21920 g(t) \u2208 G \u2282 G (K).\n\nWe can use a similar way to define a subgroup transversal to G (O). Let\nG 1 = g(t) \u2208 G lim t\u2192\u221e g(t) = e\nThis is a subgroup of G (K).\n\nG (O) and G 1 are transversal in the sense that\nT e G (K) = T e G (O) \u2295 T e G 1 because T e G (K) = g((t)) T e G (O) = g[[t]] T e G 1 = t \u22121 g[t \u22121 ]\nOne uses G 1 to analyze how G (O)-orbits in Gr are attached to each other. The ind-varieties\nGr \u00b5 = G 1 \u00b7 [\u00b5]\nis the slice transversal to Gr \u00b5 at [\u00b5]. We will use use the convention that \u00b5 is dominant. The main object of interest for us are the following varieties Gr \u03bb \u00b5 = Gr \u03bb \u2229 Gr \u00b5 These are non-empty iff \u00b5 \u2264 \u03bb. 3. The D-scaling C \u00d7 -action contracts Gr \u03bb \u00b5 to [\u00b5].\n\n\n4.\n\nGr \u03bb \u00b5 is a normal affine variety of dimension 2\u03c1 \u2228 , \u03bb \u2212 \u00b5 .\n\n\nPoisson structure\n\nThe affine Grassmannian has a natural Poisson structure. Let us describe it using the Manin triples introduced by V. Drinfeld [D2, D3]. First recall that G (K) is a Poisson ind-group. It is given by a Manin triple\ng[[t]], t \u22121 g[t \u22121 ], g((t)) , if we equip g((t)) with the standard G-invariant scalar product (xt n , yt m ) = K (x, y) \u03b4 n+m+1,0 ,(6)\nwhere \u03b4 \u2022,\u2022 is the Kronecker delta. Then the subalgebras g[[t]], t \u22121 g[t \u22121 ] are isotropic and the pairing between them is non-degenerate. Thus g((t)) is a Lie bialgebra and g [[t]] is a Lie subbialgebra. We have that G (K) is a Poisson ind-group and G (O) is its Poisson subgroup. By theorem of Drinfeld [D3] the quotient Gr = G (K) /G (O) is Poisson. The explicit construction shows that since the pairing (6) has weight , we have the following important property Proposition 2.6. The Poisson bivector on Gr is a T-eigenvector in H 0 Gr, \u039b 2 Gr with weight \u2212 .\n\nProof. The pairing is invariant with respect to A, and is of degree \u22121 in t, so the T torus acts with weigh \u2212 .\n\nThe slices Gr \u03bb \u00b5 \u2282 Gr are Poisson subvarieties. Moreover, their smooth parts are symplectic leaves, hovewer not all symplectic leaves have this form: they might be shifted by the G-action. 8\n\n\nResolutions of slices\n\nOne of the reasons what motivates us to study varieties Gr \u03bb \u00b5 is that they provide a family of symplectic resolutions. Let us recall some basics on them. See [K2] for more details.\n\nA symplectic resolution is a smooth algebraic variety X equipped with a closed non-degenerate 2-form \u03c9 such that the canonical map\nX \u2192 X 0 = Spec H 0 (X, O X )\nis a birational projective map.\n\nWell-known examples of the symplectic resolutions are Du Val singularities, the Hilbert scheme points on a plane (or a Du Val singularity), cotangent bundles to flag varieties, Nakajima quiver varieties.\n\nX 0 carries a natural structure of (possible singular) Poisson affine scheme. One can pose a question if affine Poisson varieties Gr \u03bb \u00b5 we study admit a symplectic resolution, i.e. a smooth symplectic X with X 0 = Gr \u03bb \u00b5 such that the assumptions above hold. Unfortunately, these spaces do not always possess a symplectic resolution. We'll follow [KWWY] to construct resolution in special cases.\n\nFor construction of resolutions it is convenient to assume that the cocharacter lattice is as large as possible, that is, equal to the coweight lattice. This happens when G is of adjoint type (the other extreme from being semi-simple). This assumption doesn't change the space we are allowed to consider: If G \u2192 G is a finite cover, then there is a natural inclusion Gr G \u0592\u2192 Gr G with the image being a collection of connected components of Gr G . Since the slices are connected, they belong only to one component and can be thought as defined for G. Last but not least the T-equivariant structures are compatible if one takes into account that the torus for G is a finite cover over the torus for G.\n\nFrom now on we assume that G is a connected simple group of adjoint type (so the center is trivial) and make no distinction between cocharacters and coweights unless overwise is stated.\n\nConsider a sequence of dominant weights \u03bb = (\u03bb 1 , . . . \u03bb l ) Define the (closed) convolution product:\nGr \u03bb = (L 1 , . . . , L l ) \u2208 Gr \u00d7l e \u00b7 G (O) \u03bb1 \u2212\u2192 L 1 \u03bb2 \u2212\u2192 . . . \u03bb l\u22121 \u2212 \u2212\u2212 \u2192 L l\u22121 \u03bb l \u2212 \u2192 L l\nThere's a map m \u2032 \u03bb : Gr \u03bb \u2192 Gr, (L 1 , . . . , L l ) \u2192 L l .\n\nOne can show that the image of m \u2032 \u03bb is inside Gr \u03bb , where \u03bb = i \u03bb i , so we can actually make a map m \u03bb : Gr \u03bb \u2192 Gr \u03bb .\n\n\nThen let us define\nGr \u03bb \u00b5 = m \u22121 \u03bb Gr \u03bb \u00b5 .\nThese spaces and maps are useful to construct symplectic resolutions of singular affine Gr \u03bb \u00b5 . Let all \u03bb i in \u03bb be fundamental coweights (which means this is a maximal sequence which splits \u03bb = i \u03bb i into nonzero dominant coweights). We will also need the corresponding irreducible highest weight representations V (\u03bb k ) of the Langlands dual group G \u2228 . Then there's the following result (see [KWWY], Theorem 2.9)\n\nTheorem 2.7. The following are equivalent 1. Gr \u03bb \u00b5 possesses a symplectic resolution;\n\n2. Gr \u03bb \u00b5 is smooth and thus m \u03bb gives a symplectic resolution of singularities of Gr \u03bb \u00b5 .\n\n3. There do not exist coweights \u03bd 1 , . . . , \u03bd l such that i \u03bd i = \u00b5, for all k, \u03bd k is a weight of V (\u03bb k ) and for some k , \u03bd k is not an extremal weight of V (\u03bb k ) (that is, not in the Weyl orbit of \u03bb k ).\n\nCorollary 2.8. If all \u03bb i are minuscule, then all three statements of the Theorem 2.7 hold.\n\nCorollary 2.9. If G = PSL n , then all fundamental coweights are minuscule and for all dominant coweights \u00b5 \u2264 \u03bb all three statements of the Theorem 2.7 hold.\n\nCorollary 2.10. If G is not PSL n , then there exist dominant coweights \u00b5 \u2264 \u03bb such that all three statements of the Theorem 2.7 are not satisfied.\n\nFrom this time on we assume that the pair of dominant coweights \u00b5 \u2264 \u03bb is such that the statements of the Theorem 2.7 hold.\n\nThere are important special cases of these symplectic resolutions Example 2.1. Let G = PSL 2 , then the cocharacter and coroot lattice are character (or, equivalently, weight) and root lattices of SL 2 respectively. For any integer n \u2265 1 by setting \u03bb = (n + 1)\u03c9 and \u00b5 = (n \u2212 1)\u03c9 we get that Gr \u03bb \u00b5 is A n -singularity and the map Gr (\u03c9,...,\u03c9) \u00b5 \u2192 Gr \u03bb \u00b5 is a symplectic resolution of singularity.\n\nExample 2.2. Let \u03bd be a minuscule coweight of G and \u03b9 is the Cartan involution and set \u03bb = \u03bd + \u03b9\u03bd, \u00b5 = 0. Then we get a resolution Gr Example 2.3. Let G = PSL n , \u03c9 1 be highest weight of the defining representation of SL n (so it is a PSL n -coweight). Set also \u03bb = n\u03c9 1 , \u03bb = (\u03c9 1 , . . . , \u03c9 1 ) and \u00b5 = 0. Then Gr Recall that G (K) \u22ca C \u00d7 acts on Gr, so it also acts diagonally on Gr \u00d7l for any l (see e.g. [D]).\n\nProposition 2.11.\n\n1. For any sequence \u03bb the subscheme Gr \u03bb \u2282 Gr \u00d7l is G (O) \u22ca C \u00d7 -invariant 2. The resolution of singularities m \u03bb : Gr \u03bb \u00b5 \u2192 Gr \u03bb \u00b5 is T-equivariant.\n\n\nEquivariant geometry\n\nHere we review some facts about T-action on the slices. One can find the proofs in [D].\n\nProposition 2.12. The fixed loci X T and X A are equal to the following disjoint union of finitely many points\nX T = X A = ([\u00b5 1 ] , . . . , [\u00b5 l ]) \u2208 Gr \u00d7l \u2200i \u00b5 i \u2212 \u00b5 i\u22121 is a weight of V (\u03bb i ) \u00b5 l = \u00b5, \u00b5 0 = 0 .\nProof. Since the T-action is diagonal, we have that (L 1 , . . . , L l ) \u2208 X T iff \u2200i L i has form [\u00b5 i ] for some coweight \u00b5 i . Next, conditions for such points to be in X are a A condition to be in Gr \u03bb . That is,\n\u2200i L i\u22121 \u03bbi \u2212 \u2192 L i which gives that \u00b5 i \u2212 \u00b5 i\u22121 is a weight of V (\u03bb i ) with convention \u00b5 0 = 0 to make L 0 = [0] = e \u00b7 G (O).\nb A condition to be in m \u22121 \u03bb (Gr \u00b5 ). That is, L l = m \u03bb (L 1 , . . . , L l ) = [\u00b5], which is equivalent to \u00b5 l = \u00b5. This gives the description of X T in the proposition. Using Gr A = Gr T , a similar argument shows the same for X A .\n\nRemark. If \u03bb i is minuscule, the constraint of \u03bd i to be a weight of V (\u03bb i ) just means that \u00b5 i \u2212\u00b5 i\u22121 \u2208 W \u03bb i .\n\nRemark. If all \u03bb i are minuscule, the fixed points are in bijection with a basis of the weight \u00b5 subspace of the G \u2228 -representation V (\u03bb 1 ) \u2297 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u2297 V (\u03bb l ).\n\nRemark. The tight connection between the cohomology of sheaves on the resolution of slices for G and the representation theory of the Langlands dual G \u2228 is known as geometric Satake correspondence [G,MV,MV2]. A well-known spectial case is\nH * Gr (\u03bb1,...,\u03bb l ) \u00b5 \u2243 V \u03bb1 \u2297 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u2297 V \u03bb l [\u00b5]\nSince the resolution of slices are T-equivariantly formal, this also follows from T-equivariant cohomology and the combinatorics of the fixed points. Then for all i, 0 < i < l, we define \u03a3 i (p) = \u00b5 i , and for coherent notation we set\n\u03a3 0 (p) = 0, \u03a3 l (p) = \u00b5.\nThis gives a sequence \u03a3 (p) = (\u03a3 0 (p) , . . . , \u03a3 l (p)) .\n\nWe also define for all i,\n1 \u2264 i \u2264 l \u2206 i (p) = \u03a3 i (p) \u2212 \u03a3 i\u22121 (p) .\nOne forms the second sequence from these coweights\n\u2206 (p) = (\u2206 1 (p) , . . . , \u2206 l (p)) .\nInformally speaking, \u2206 (p) is the sequence of increments, so \u03a3 (p) is the sequence of their partial sums. This explains the notation.\n\nOne useful way to think about the fixed points of Gr \u03bb \u00b5 is that they are one-to-one certain piecewiselinear paths in the coweight lattice. Let P p be the piecewise linear path connecting points in the coweight lattice.\n0 = \u03a3 0 (p) , \u03a3 1 (p) , . . . , \u03a3 l\u22121 (p) , \u03a3 l (p) = \u00b5 11 0 \u03c9 1 \u03b1 \u2228 2 \u03c9 2 \u00b5 = 2\u03c9 1 + \u03c9 2 (a) Weight multiplicities of \u03b1 \u2228 2 \u2212 and \u2212\u03b1 \u2228 2 are 1. 0 \u03c9 1 \u03b1 \u2228 1 \u03c9 2 \u00b5 = 2\u03c9 1 + \u03c9 2 (b) Weight multiplicities of \u03b1 \u2228 1 and \u2212\u03b1 \u2228 2 \u2212 are 2.\nThe paths P p are the ones that have l segments, start at the origin, and end at \u00b5. The ith segment must be a weight of V (\u03bb i ) (as said earlier, this is equivalent to being a Weyl reflection of \u03bb i if \u03bb i is minuscule). See Figure 1 for an example of a typical path in the case G = PSL 3 and Gr (\u03c91,\u03c91,\u03c91,\u03c91,\u03c92) \u03c91+\u03c92 .\n\nUsing the paths P p is useful for a combinatorial description of the tangent weights at the fixed points. We postpone the proof until the appendix.\n\nTheorem 2.13. The only weights in T p X are of form \u03b1 \u2228 + n for a root \u03b1 \u2228 and n \u2208 Z. Moreover, the multiplicity of weight \u03b1 \u2228 + n is the number of crossings of P p with the hyperplane\n\u2022, \u03b1 \u2228 \u2212 n + 1 2 = 0\nin the direction of the halfspace containing 0.\n\nAn illustration of the statement of Theorem 2.13 is shown on Figure 2. The dashed lines and green halfphanes correspond to pairs of weights, the blue dots show the intersections under consideration. We used the standard identification of (short) roots \u03b1 \u2228 1 and \u03b1 \u2228 2 with vectors of length squared 2 via a properly normalized invariant inner product to visualize them.\n\nThe following straightforward corollary is useful in further computations Corollary 2.14. Let p \u2208 X A = X T . Then\n1. A weight \u03b1 \u2228 can have non-zero multiplicity in T p X only if \u03b1 \u2228 is a root, 2. If \u03b1 \u2228 is a positive root, then the multiplicity of \u03b1 \u2228 in T p X is the number of such i that \u2206 i (p) , \u03b1 \u2228 = \u22121. Equivalently, this is N \u2212 \u00b5, \u03b1 \u2228 ,\nwhere N is the number of such i that\n\u2206 i (p) , \u03b1 \u2228 = +1.\n3. If \u03b1 \u2228 is a negative root, then the multiplicity of \u03b1 \u2228 in T p X is equal to the multiplicity of \u2212\u03b1 \u2228 in T p X.\n\nThe slices have a natural collection line bundles (see [D]) The line bundle O(1) gives a collection of line bundles on Gr \u03bb \u00b5 via coordinate-wise pullbacks:\nL i = \u03c0 * i O(1), where \u03c0 i : Gr \u03bb \u00b5 \u2192 Gr, 0 \u2264 i \u2264 l (L 0 , L 1 , . . . , L l ) \u2192 L i .\nThey turn out to be T-equivariant. For our goal it's more relevant to consider the following related collection of line bundles\nE i = L i /L i\u22121 for 1 \u2264 i \u2264 l.(7)\nWe know that these line bundles are sufficient for our purposes, more precisely the following holds. More precisely, the following statements follow from similar statements for L i in [D]\n\nProposition 2.15.\n1. H 2 T (X), is generated as a vector space by c T 1 (E i ) (1 \u2264 i < l) and constants H 2 T (pt). 2. H 2 (X) is generated as a vector space by c 1 (E i ) (1 \u2264 i < l). 3. Pic X \u2297 Z Q is generated as a vector space by E i (1 \u2264 i < l).\n.\n\n\nSo, to study quantum multiplication by elements of H 2\n\nT (X) and the quantum connection, it's enough to study quantum multiplication by c T 1 (E i ). We know the action of c T 1 (E i ) in the fixed point basis. It's diagonal with eigenvalues given by restrictions to the fixed points. For the purposes of this paper it's enough to look only A-equivariant weights (set = 0 in the formulas from [D]).\n\nProposition 2.16.\n\n\nThe\nA-weight of a line bundle L i at a fixed point p \u2208 X A is K (\u03a3 i (p) , \u2022) 2. The A-weight of a line bundle E i at a fixed point p \u2208 X A is K (\u2206 i (p) , \u2022)\n\nEquivariant cohomology and stable envelopes\n\nFrom now on until the appendix the base ring for all cohomology is the field Q, unless stated otherwise. All the results generalize straightforwardly to the case of any field of characteristic 0.\n\nComputations in equivariant cohomology heavily rely on the well-known localization Theorem [AB].\n\nTheorem 2.17. (Atiyah-Bott) The restriction map in the localized equivariant cohomology\nH * T (X) loc \u2192 H * T X T loc\nis an isomorphism.\n\nHere and later we use notation H * T (X) loc := H * T (X) \u2297 H * T (pt) Frac H * T (pt). If X is proper then there is the fundamental class [X] \u2208 H A 2 dim X (X). By this gives a pushforward to a point homomorphism\nH * T (X) \u2192 H * T (pt) \u03b3 \u2192 X \u03b3\nquite often called integration by analogy with de Rham cohomology. Then the localization theorem allows one to compute this using only restrictions to the fixed locus.\nX \u03b3 = Z\u2282X T Z \u03b9 * Z \u03b3 e T N Z/X (8)\nwhere the sum is taken over all components\nZ \u2282 X T , e T (\u2022) is the equivariant Euler class, N Z/X is the normal bundle to Z in X. If X is not proper the fundamental class lies in Borel-Moore (equivariant) homology [X] \u2208 H T,BM 2 dim X (X)\n. This pairs naturally with the equivariant cohomology with compact support H * T,c (X) and gives a pushforward map H * T,c (X) \u2192 H * T (pt) . In general, we have the following natural maps\nH * T,c (X) H * T (X) H * T,c X T H * T X T \u03b9 * \u03b9 *(9)\nThe vertical arrows are restrictions. X T is closed subvariety, so the inclusion \u03b9 : X A \u2192 X is proper and the pullback is well-defined in the cohomology with compact support). After the localization the vertical arrows in (9) become isomorphisms. Assume now that X T is proper. Then the bottom arrow in (9) becomes an isomorphism because the compact support condition becomes vacuous. Then we get an isomorphism\nH * T,c (X) \u223c \u2212 \u2192 H * T (X) which gives the pushforward H * T (X) loc \u2192 H * T (pt) loc We still denote it by X \u03b3.\nThe relation (8) still holds. Some authors use it to define X \u03b3. As a side affect, a priori, the answer one gets by this definition is in H * T (pt) loc = Frac H * T (pt) because of the division by Euler classes. However, we see that the image of non-localized compactly supported classes H * T,c (X) is inside H * T (pt). This defines on H * T (X) loc the structure of a Frobenius algebra over H * T (pt) loc . In particular, we often use the natural pairing\n\u03b3 1 , \u03b3 2 X = X \u03b3 1 \u222a \u03b3 2 .\nIf X is clear we omit it in the notation. We think of H * T (pt) as the ground ring. We usually write the multiplication in H * T (pt) by \u00b7 to simplify notation.\n\nThe multiplication in H * T (X) is still denoted by \u222a. We also refer to it as classical multiplication as opposed to its deformation, quantum multiplication.\n\n\n14\n\n\nStable Envelopes\n\nFor details we refer the reader to [MO2]. Under certain choices (namely, chamber C and a polarization \u01eb on X A ) one can define a map going the \"wrong way\".\n\nTheorem 2.18. (Maulik-Okounkov) There exists a unique map of H * T (pt)-modules\nStab \u01eb C : H * T X A \u2192 H * T (X) such that for any component Z \u2282 X A and \u03b3 \u2208 H * T/A (Z), the stable envelope \u0393 = Stab \u01eb C (\u03b3) satisfies 1. supp \u0393 \u2282 Attr f C (Z), 2. \u03b9 * Z \u0393 = \u00b1e A N \u2212C p \u222a \u03b3, where the sign is fixed by the polarization: \u03b9 * Z \u0393| A = \u01eb Z \u222a \u03b3| A , 3. deg A \u03b9 * Z \u2032 \u0393 < 1 2 dim X for any Z \u2032 < C Z.\nIn the spaces of our interest X A is finite discrete, so H * T X A has a basis 1 p of classes those only non-zero restriction is 1 at p \u2208 X A . To simplify notation we write\nStab \u01eb C (p) instead of Stab \u01eb C (1 p )\n. The classes Stab \u01eb C (p) may be thought of as a refined version of (the Poincar\u00e9-dual class to) the fundamental cycle \u00b1 Attr C (p) . This explains the first two conditions in the Theorem 2.18. The last condition is required to ensure these classes behave well under deformations of the symplectic variety.\n\nFor symplectic resolutions, if one restricts Stab \u01eb C (p) to the torus A (sets = 0), it has a non-zero coefficient only at p [MO2]. Since the fixed point is a basis in the localized cohomology H * T (X) loc , stable envelopes also form a basis in the localized cohomology. This is why we sometimes refer to Stab \u01eb C (p) as the stable basis.\n\n\nClassical multiplication in stable basis\n\nLet us first discuss in general relation between classical multiplication of a stable envelope by a divisor and restrictions of stable envelopes. First we define two families of diagonal operators\nH i : H * A X A \u2192 H * A X A(10)1 p \u2192 K (\u2206 i (p) , \u2022) + 2 K (\u2206 i (p) , \u00b5) 1 p \u2126 ij 0 : H * A X A \u2192 H * A X A(11)1 p \u2192 K (\u2206 i (p) , \u2206 j (p)) 1 p\nThen we introduce a family of strictly triangular operators. Let i, j be such that 0 \u2264 i, j \u2264 l, \u03b1 \u2228 be a root and \u01eb be a polarization. We define\n\u2126 ij \u2212\u03b1,\u01eb : H * A X A \u2192 H * A X A(12)\nby the following property: for any p \u2208 X A\n\n\u2022 If there exists q \u2208 X A satisfying conditions\n\u2206 i (q) = \u2206 i (p) \u2212 \u03b1, \u2206 j (q) = \u2206 j (p) + \u03b1,(13)\u2206 k (q) = \u2206 k (p) for all k, k = i, k = j, then \u2126 ij \u2212\u03b1,\u01eb (1 p ) = \u03c3 \u01eb p,q K (\u03b1, \u03b1) 2 1 q .\nThe signs \u03c3 \u01eb p,q \u2208 {\u00b11} are the following product of signs\n\u03c3 \u01eb p,q = \u03c3C ,\u01eb q/X \u03c3C ,\u01eb p/X = \u01eb p e A N \u2212 C p/X e A N \u2212 C q/X \u01eb q ,(14)\nwhere C is any Weyl chamber adjacent to the wall \u03b1 \u2228 = 0. The sign does not depend on this choice as shown in [D].\n\n\u2022 If there's no such q, we set\n\u2126 ij \u2212\u03b1,\u01eb (1 p ) = 0.\nRemark. By the conditions on \u2206 (p)'s from the minuscule weight restriction, the existence for such q \u2208 X A is equivalent to the following two conditions on p\n\u2206 i (p) , \u03b1 \u2228 = 1,(15)\u2206 j (p) , \u03b1 \u2228 = \u22121.(16)\nNow for any Weyl chamber we define the following operator\n\u2126 ij C,\u01eb = 1 2 \u2126 ij 0 + \u03b1> C 0 \u2126 ij \u03b1,\u01eb .(17)\nRemark. The notation \u2126 ij C,\u01eb suggests that these operators are related to Casimir operators in representation theory. We'll make this statement more precise later. The minus sign for \u2212\u03b1 in the definition of \u2126 ij \u2212\u03b1,\u01eb is introduced to make this comparison easier. Remark. If one chooses polarization \u01eb p = e A N \u2212C p/X , then the signs in \u2126 ij \u03b1,\u01eb with a simple \u03b1 (with respect to C) are all +1. We will need it later to choose the right basis in representation-theoretic language.\n\nSimilar to stable envelopes, for a simpler notation we write\nH i (p) and \u2126 ij C,\u01eb (p) instead of H i (1 p )\nand \u2126 ij C,\u01eb (1 p ) . The main result from [D] on classical multiplication in the stable basis is the following theorem.\n\nTheorem 2.19. The classical multiplication is given by the following formula\nc T 1 (E i ) \u222a Stab \u01eb C (p) = Stab \u01eb C \uf8ee \uf8f0 H i (p) + j<i \u2126 ji \u2212C,\u01eb (p) \u2212 i<j \u2126 ij \u2212C,\u01eb (p) \uf8f9 \uf8fb .\n\nQuantum Cohomology\n\nIn this chapter we compute the multiplication by a divisor in the quantum cohomology. This gives rise to the quantum differential equation, which we match in the next paper with certain representationtheoretic object, called trigonometric Knizhnik-Zamolodchikov connection.\n\nOur computation is based on the idea of the reduction to Picard rank 1, appearing in [BMO] for the case of the cotangent bundle of the full flag variety. We follow this paper quite closely for the definition of the reduced class and the application of a deformation family to pass to the wall cases.\n\nThe first partial result on the purely quantum cohomology was done in M. Viscardi's thesis [V]. Let us point out some issues with this computation 16 1. The computation was done only for the simplest case of \u03bb = (\u03bb 1 , \u03bb 2 ), it was only mentioned that the general case can be done by reduction to Picard rank 1, but no actual computation, 2. The choice of basis was the fixed point basis, which allowed only to compute the leading part of the purely quantum multiplication. It was completely unprotected from corrections in , 3. The classical part was not computed. Moreover, even if it's done (for example, by a version of Proposition 2.16 with T-weight, see [D]) in the fixed point basis it must be diagonal, which makes it hard to identify with asymmectic trigonometric Knizhnik-Zamolodchikov connection.\n\nAs we see from the asymmetry of the final answer this means that the corrections to the purely quantum part must be assymmetric (in particular, the corrections do appear!), 4. The diagonal part was explicitly omitted, but never restored, which lead to appearance of \"truncated\" Casimir operators, missing exactly the Cartan (diagonal!) part.\n\nWe don't have these problems in our computation.\n\n\nPreliminaries on quantum cohomology\n\nQuantum cohomology is a deformation of ordinary equivariant cohomology by three-point Gromov-Witten invariants (by a formal parameter q). We define it by the following formula\n\u03b3 1 , \u03b3 2 * \u03b3 3 X = \u03b3 1 , \u03b3 2 \u222a \u03b3 3 X + d\u2208H eff 2 (X,Z) \u03b3 1 , \u03b3 2 , \u03b3 3 X 0,3,d q d for any \u03b3 1 , \u03b3 2 , \u03b3 3 \u2208 H * T (X). Here \u2022, \u2022, \u2022 X 0,3,d are genus zero three-point degree d equivariant Gromov- Witten invariants.\nThe three-point Gromov-Witten invariants are the integrals over a virtual fundamental cycle\n\u03b3 1 , \u03b3 2 , \u03b3 3 X 0,3,d = [M0,3(X,d)] vir ev * 1 \u03b3 1 \u222a ev * 2 \u03b3 2 \u222a ev * 3 \u03b3 3\nof the Deligne-Mumford stack of stable genus 0 degree d maps to X with 3 marked points. The integration in this formula in the pushforward map\nH * T M 0,3 (X, d) \u2192 H * T (pt)\nwhich is given by the virtual fundamental cycle M 0,3 (X, d) vir \u2208 H T * M 0,3 (X, d) . For the spaces of our interest M 0,3 (X, d) are not proper in general and the virtual fundamental\nclass is only in Borel-Moore (eqivariant) homology M 0,3 (X, d) vir \u2208 H T,BM * M 0,3 (X, d) .\nHowever, let us assume that there is proper T-equivariant map to an affine T-variety X 0 \u03c0 : X \u2192 X 0 such that X 0 is contracted to a point x \u2208 X 0 by some cocharacter \u03bb : C \u00d7 \u2192 T. We know that for the spaces X = Gr \u03bb \u00b5 it holds. Under this assumption the T-fixed locus M T 0,3 (X, d) is proper since all T-invariant mas have the image in \u03c0 \u22121 (x) which is proper. Then the integration (or pushforward to a point)\nH * T M 0,3 (X, d) loc \u2192 H * T (pt) loc\ncan be defined as mentioned in the previous chapter and computed via the localization formula.\n\nLet us denote by Q[[q d ]] the algebra of formal power series in q d , where d \u2208 H eff 2 (X, Z) are the effective curve classes.\n\nThe quantum multiplication gives the quantum equivariant cohomology\nQH * T (X) = H * T (X) \u2297 Q Q[[q d ]]\na structure of a supercommutative associative algebra. This is a deformation of H * T (X). We will split the quantum multiplication into classical part and purely quantum part\n\u03b3 1 * \u03b3 2 = \u03b3 1 \u222a \u03b3 2 + \u03b3 1 * q \u03b3 2 .(18)\nWe are interested in the case when \u03b3 3 is a divisor, that is \u03b3 3 = D \u2208 H 2 A (X). Then we can apply the divisor equation to reduce three-point invariants to two-point invariants\n\u03b3 1 , \u03b3 2 , D X 0,3,d = D, d \u03b3 1 , \u03b3 2 X 0,2,d ,(19)\nwhere D, d is the pairing of a homology and cohomology class under the natural map H * T (X) \u2192 H * (X).\n\n\nReduction to Picard rank 1\n\n\nTwo approaches to the reduced virtual class\n\nOne can consider non-equivaraint counts instead of T-equivariant ones. There are two related reasons why these counts must vanish for a symplectic resolution X and d = 0. Let us briefly outline them.\n\nThe first one comes from a surjective cosection in the obstruction bundle. See [KL] for a more general notion of cosection localization.\n\nThe cosection appears as follows. We work with the tangent-obstruction theory relative to the prestable curves, so let us show how the construction work on a fixed prestable curve C. Let M C (X, d) be the moduli space of stable maps from C to X with the degree class d = 0. The standard relative tangent-obstruction theory for M C (X, d) is defined by the natural morphism\nR\u03c0 * (ev * T X) \u2228 \u2192 LM C (X, d),\nwhere ev :\nC \u00d7 M C (X, d) \u2192 X, \u03c0 : C \u00d7 M C (X, d) \u2192 M C (X, d)\nare the natural maps and LM C (X, d) is the cotangent complex of M C (X, d).\n\nLet \u03c9 \u03c0 be the relative dualizing sheaf. Then the pairing with the symplectic form \u03c9 and the pullback of forms induces a map ev\n* (T X) \u2192 \u03c9 \u03c0 \u2297 (C\u03c9) * .\nThis gives a map of complexes\nR\u03c0 * (\u03c9 \u03c0 ) \u2228 \u2297 C\u03c9 \u2192 R\u03c0 * ev * (T X) \u2228 .\nThen we truncate\n\u03c4 \u2264\u22121 R\u03c0 * (\u03c9 \u03c0 ) \u2228 \u2297 C\u03c9 \u2192 R\u03c0 * ev * (T X) \u2228 .\nThis truncation is a trivial bundle. It carries non-trivial equivariant structure as long as the torus acts non-trivially on \u03c9. This map gives a surjective cosection in the obstructions. The second reason to vanish is the deformations of X. On one hand, the virtual fundamental class is deforamtion invariant. On the other hand, we know that X has a large family of universal deformations and, moreover, a generic deformation has no projective curves. This means that M 0,3 (X \u2032 , d) vir = 0 at a generic symplectic deformation X \u2032 of X for d = 0. Combining these two facts, we get that for d = 0 the virtual fundamental class M 0,3 (X, d) vir = 0 for X itself.\n\nRemark. Same vanishings happen in A-eqivariant count instead of T-equivariant one. The symplectic form has the zero A-weight, so we would still have a non-vanishing cosection of weight zero in the obstruction bundle. Similarly, in the universal deformation the A-action on X extends to the fiberwise A-action in the universal deformation family.\n\nRemark. Now we see how the T-equivariant counts destroy the vanishing constructions. In the first approach the cosection gets a non-zero weight \u2212 . The second approach doesn't work because T scales the base of the deformation with weight and the zero fiber becomes distinct.\n\nEach of these reasons suggest how one may modify the counting problem to avoid such vanishing. More precisely, how to track the part which vanishes when one passes to the non-equivariant case, and define the remaining part, which is called the reduced fundamental class.\n\nFirst, let us show how one modifies the tangent-obstruction bundle. Above we showed that there is a map\n\u03b9 : \u03c4 \u2264\u22121 R\u03c0 * (\u03c9 \u03c0 ) \u2228 \u2297 C\u03c9 \u2192 R\u03c0 * ev * (T X) \u2228 .\nwhich is responsible for the appearance of a surjective cosection in the obstruction bundle. Now we can \"kill\" it by considering the mapping cone of \u03b9, C(\u03b9). Then the induced map\nC(\u03b9) \u2192 M C (X, d)\ngive a perfect obstruction theory. This is the reduced obstruction theory, and the associated fundamental class is called the reduced virtual fundamental class. The second approach comes from one-parametric families of deformations. Let X \u2192 B be a symplectic deformation of (X, \u03c9) over a smooth curve B. Let us denote the point in the base over which (X, \u03c9) lies as b \u2208 B. Pick d \u2208 H 2 (X, Z) \u2282 H 2 X, Z . We assume that the deformation X and are in general position, that is 1. The only fiber of X \u2192 B where there are curves of degree d is (X, \u03c9) over b.\n\n\nThe following composition is an isomorphism\nT b B \u2192 H 2 (X, T X) \u223c \u2212 \u2192 H 2 (X, T * X) d\u2229 \u2212 \u2212 \u2192 C\nwhere the first map is the Kodaira-Spencer map, the second map is induced by the symplectic structure, the last map is the pairing with the homology class d.\n\nRemark. If X is a symplectic resolution and we have the universal family of the deformations, then the first condition says that the image of B intersects exactly once the hyperplane (or intersection of hyperplanes) associated to d. The second condition means that this intersection is transversal.\n\nThe following result is the Theorem 1 of [MP]. \n\n\nChoice of basis\n\nLet (X, \u03c9) be a symplectic variety with a torus T acting on it in such a way that the symplectic form \u03c9 is scaled by T-weight . Then from the explicit description of the reduced tangent-obstruction theory we see that it misses one trivial line subbundle in the obstructions with weight \u2212 . This gives\nM 0,n (X, d) vir = \u2212 M 0,n (X, d) red\nin H T,BM * M 0,n (X, d) , d = 0. This allows us to write for d = 0\n\u03b3 1 , \u03b3 2 X,vir 0,2,d = \u2212 \u03b3 1 , \u03b3 2 X,red 0,2,d\nwhere the tags vir and red denote the fundamental class we use. In order to recover the usual Gromov-Witten invariant we have to use the non-reduced class in (19). However the reduced class allows us to apply the trick from [BMO].\n\nIn our case X is a symplectic variety, so it has trivial canonical class. Then the virtual dimension of M 0,2 (X, d) is\n\u2212 K X , d + dim X + n \u2212 3 = dim X \u2212 1.\nThus the degree of M 0,n (X, d) red is 2 dim X \u2212 2 and the degree of M 0,n (X, d) red is 2 dim X.\n\nLet \u03b3 1 , \u03b3 2 \u2208 H * T (X) be non-localized classes. If \u03b3 1 \u222a \u03b3 2 have compact support, then the support of ev * 1 \u03b3 1 \u222a ev * 2 \u03b3 2 is also proper and the 2-point reduced Gromov-Witten invariant\n\u03b3 1 , \u03b3 2 X,red 0,2,d \u2208 H * T (pt)\nlies in non-localized cohomology of a point. We get that for such classes the invariants are \u03b3 1 , \u03b3 2 X 0,2,d are non-zero by dimension argument only if we have deg \u03b3 1 + deg \u03b3 2 \u2265 2 dim X.\n\nPossibility to get invariants in non-localized H * T (pt) shows why it is important to work with nonlocalized classes. We have finitely many terms to compute, it makes the problem more doable.\n\nAt the same time it shows disadvantages in using the fixed point basis in equivariant cohomology. By definition, it lies in the localized cohomology. If one replaces it via pushforwards \u03b9 p, * 1 of the units from the fixed points it is better, because these classes are non-localized. In this case we get that \u03b9 q, * 1, \u03b9 p, * 1 X,red 0,2,d \u2208 H 2 dim X T (pt) which means that we have to compute a polynomial of degree dim X. There is a better choice.\n\nAssume that X T is finite and the conditions for the existence of the stable envelopes are satisfied. Then we can take\n\u03b3 1 = Stab \u01eb \u2212C (q) , \u03b3 2 = Stab \u01eb C (p) .\nAs we said in the previous chapter, these classes are dual, so computing these 2-point invariants exactly gives us the matrix of the purely quantum multiplication in the stable basis.\n\nRecall that the degree of Stab \u01eb C (p) is dim X. Then\nStab \u01eb \u2212C (q) , Stab \u01eb C (p) X,red 0,2,d \u2208 H 0 T (pt) \u2243 Q,\nso the invariants are just numbers.\n\nIn particular, if X T = X A these number can be computed via A-equivariant localization instead of T-equivariant one (as usual, we set A \u2282 ker to be a subtorus acting by symplectomorphisms). 20\n\nFor a symplectic resolution X this is convenient, since the stable envelope Stab \u01eb C (p) restricted to A vanish everywhere except the point p. Then we get\nStab \u01eb \u2212C (q) , Stab \u01eb C (p) X,red 0,2,d = \u01eb q \u01eb p M A 0,(p,q) (X,d) red 1,\nwhere the integral is defined via A-equivariant localization and\nM A 0,(p,q) (X, d) is a subspace of the A-fixed locus M 0,2 (X, d) A = p,q\u2208X A M A 0,(p,q) (X, d)\nwhich maps the first marked point to p and the second marked point to q.\n\n\nReduction to walls\n\nWe reduced the computation of the quantum multiplication to the computation of A-localized integrals\nM A 0,(p,q) (X,d) red 1.\nThe space A-fixed maps to X has components of high dimension, sice we saw that even T-invariant curves are not isolated in X. In principle, it is possible to compute the integral via deformation to the case which has only isolated A-invariant projective curves. This appoach was used in [BMO] for one of the most canonical example of the sypmlectic resolution, the Springer resolution.\n\nLet X be a symplectic resolution and let X be its sufficiently generic twistor deformation over A 2 by a pair of line bundles:\nX X 0 A 2 .\nBy \"sufficiently generic\" we mean that 1. The generic fiber of X \u2192 A 2 has no curves. By the discussion of the wall structure in twistor deformations, this means the fibers with curves lie over a union of finitely many lines H \u2282 A 2 passing through the origin 0 \u2208 A 2 .\n\n2. If H \u2282 A 2 is such a line passing through 0, that there are curves over H \\ 0, then curves there is d \u2208 H 2 (X, Q) such that the degrees of all such curves are multiples of d. We consider d up to scaling. Then we denote such a line by H d and refer to them as \"walls\" in A 2 .\n\nThe main example of such a deformation is the family over a plane A 2 \u2243 P \u2282 B u in the base of the universal symplectic deformation of X\nX X X u 0 P B u\nas long as P intersects transversely all the walls. The walls in P are exactly the intersections with the walls in B u .\n\nLet L 0 \u2282 A 2 be any line passing through the origin 0 \u2208 A 2 which is not a wall. We get a family X 0 over L 0\nX X 0 X 0 L 0 A 2 21\nThen by the Proposition 3.1 the integral over the reduced virtual class can be computed via X 0\nM A 0,(p,q) (X,d) red 1 = M A 0,( p 0 , q 0 ) ( X0,d) vir 1,\nwhere p 0 and q 0 are the components of X A 0 containing p and q respectively. They have exactly one point in the fiber over every point A 1 , they show how the A-fixed points p, q vary in the family X A 0 . Now we can use the deformation invariance of the virtual fundamental class\nM A 0,( p0, q0) X 0 , d vir .\nParallel shifts along L 0 give us a quotient A 2 \u0589 A 1 whose fiber over 0 is L 0 and over another point t = 0 is a parallel line L t . Let X t be the family X restricted to L t . Then the composition\nX \u2192 A 2 \u0589 A 1\ngives a family whose fiber over 0 is X 0\nX 0 X X t 0 A 1 t\nIn other words, it's a deformation of X 0 . The fixed components p 0 deform to p t \u2282 X A t . By the deformation invariance of the virtual class First let us point that some effective curve classes d are repserented only by curves over the origin 0 \u2208 A 2 . Then the moduli space on the RHS is empty and the integral is zero.\n\nFrom now on we assume that effective d has representatives not only over the origin. By construction, this means that there is a wall H d which has curves of degree d in the fibers over it. By construction L t intersects with the hyperplane H d at exactly one point and this intersection is transverse. Call the fiber of X t over this point X d and denote by p \u2032 , q \u2032 \u2208 X d A the fibers of p t and q t . Then by Proposition 3.1 we have\nM A 0,( p t , q t ) ( Xt,d) vir 1 = M A 0,(p \u2032 ,q \u2032 ) (X d ,d) red 1.\nCombining all the equalities of integrals, we get that the integral of interest\nM A 0,(p,q) (X,d) red 1 = M A 0,(p \u2032 ,q \u2032 ) (X d ,d) red 1(20)\nif there is a wall H d , and zero otherwise. This formula relates a count of curves of degree d with a count of curves in a generic fiber X d over the corresponding wall H d .\n\nThe invariant curves in X d are much simpler as we will see in examples. For the spaces of our interest the moduli space M A 0,(p \u2032 ,q \u2032 ) X d , d has only isolated points. We summarize the reduction in the following statement 22\n\nProposition 3.2. Let X be a symplectic resolution satisfying the assumptions in the definition of the stable envelopes and let X A be finite. If for an effective curve class d there is a wall H d in a sufficiently generic 2-parametric deformation\nStab \u01eb \u2212C (q) , Stab \u01eb C (p) X,vir 0,2,d = \u2212 \u01eb q \u01eb p M A 0,(p \u2032 ,q \u2032 ) (X d ,d) red 1\nfor any p, q \u2208 X A and the corresponding A-fixed points p \u2032 , q \u2032 in a generic fiber X d over the wall H d .\n\nIf there is no wall of form H d , then\nStab \u01eb \u2212C (q) , Stab \u01eb C (p) X,red 0,2,d = 0.\nRemark. Note that it is important for us that we are doing A-localized computation, not T-equivariant one. The torus T would scale the base and make the origin a distinguished point, the deformation invariance would be destroyed.\n\n\nComputation of wall contributions\n\n\nWall deformations\n\nNow we restrict to the case X = Gr \u03bb \u00b5 . Then the 2-parameter deformation can be made by restricting the Beilinson-Drinfeld Grassmannian to a generic plane P \u2243 A 2 containing the origin in the base A l Gr \u03bb \u00b5 X Gr\n\u03bb \u00b5 0 P A l\nThe walls in P are the intesections of P with the walls in A l , that is H ij = {t i = t j }. As mentioned before, all fibers in the complement of these walls have no projective curves. Now let us compute the contribution from a generic fiber over each wall. Let (t 1 , . . . , t l ) \u2208 H ij \u2282 A l be a generic point in the wall H ij , that is t i = t j (i < j) and all other t k are pairwise distinct. Then we know that the fiber of the global convolution Grassmannian splits over this point in the following way\nGr \u03bb (t1,...,t l ) \u2243 Gr \u03bbi,\u03bbj \u00d7 k =i k =j Gr \u03bb k .\nThe restriction of the global line bundles E i , E j are the pull-backs of E 1 and E 2 respectively from Gr \u03bbi,\u03bbj . For other k, E k restricts to a pullback of E 1 \u2243 O(1) from Gr \u03bb k . These are isomorphisms as A-equivariant line bundles.\n\nWe are interested in the fiber of the global subspace Gr \u03bb \u00b5,(t1,...,t l ) \u2282 Gr \u03bb (t1,...,t l ) . We denote this fiber as X ij :\nX ij \u2282 Gr \u03bbi,\u03bbj \u00d7 k =i k =j Gr \u03bb k .\nFrom the period map we find that any algebraic curve C in X ij must have fundamental class of form c(e i \u2212 e j ). This gives that the degree with respect to the restrictions of all line bundles E k is zero unless k = i or k = j. Since O(1) is ample on Gr \u03bb and generate the Picard group, this implies that the projection of C to each factor of Gr \u03bb k is constant. Moreover, the degrees with respect to E i and E j must be opposite. That means that the degree with respect to L 2 on Gr \u03bbi,\u03bbj is zero (as the restricition of E i E j ), which similarly forces the projection to the last coordinate of Gr \u03bbi,\u03bbj to be constant. Now we compute the integrals over the moduli space of stable maps M 0,2 X ij , d via A-equivariant localization.\n\nThe A-fixed locus has a description, similar to the A-fixed locus of Gr \u03bb \u00b5 in Proposition 2.12:\n\nProposition 3.3. The fixed locus X ij A is the following disjoint union of finitely many points\n([\u03bd i ] , [\u03bd j ]) , [\u03bd 1 ] , . . . , [\u03bd i ], . . . , [\u03bd j ], . . . , [\u03bd l ]\nwhere the hats denote omitted terms,\n([\u03bd i ] , [\u03bd j ]) \u2208 Gr \u03bbi,\u03bbj A and [\u03bd k ] \u2208 Gr \u03bb k A\nfor all k, k = i, k = j, and, finally,\nk =i \u03bd k = \u00b5.\nProof. Omitted.\n\nThe identification of the line bundles also allow us to compare the fixed points of X ij and the central fiber X, that is, to say which A-fixed points go to which fixed points of X as we approach the central fiber along the hyperplane.\n\nFor any T-equivariant line bundle L on X the A-weights on a point p \u2032 \u2208 X ij A and its limit p \u2208 X A must be the same. This is because A-action commutes with C \u00d7 and the limit is taken by the C \u00d7 . The A-weights of E i uniquely determine \u2206 i of the fixed point.\n\nThen the limit of\np \u2032 = ([\u03bd i ] , [\u03bd j ]) , [\u03bd 1 ] , . . . , [\u03bd i ], . . . , [\u03bd j ], . . . , [\u03bd l ] is p with \u2206 k (p) = \u03bd k if k = j (21) \u2206 j (p) = \u03bd j \u2212 \u03bd i .(22)\nSimilarly to the case of the slices one finds that A-invariant curves in Gr \u03bbi,\u03bbj are of form C 12\np,\u03b1 \u2228 , where p = ([\u03bd i ] , [\u03bd j ]) \u2208 Gr \u03bbi,\u03bbj A and \u03bd i , \u03b1 \u2228 > 0,(23)\u03bd j , \u03b1 \u2228 = 0.(24)\nRecall that C 12 p,\u03b1 \u2228 has two fixed points: p and\nq = ([\u03bd i \u2212 \u03b1] , [\u03bd j ])\nand the tangent weight of C 12 p,\u03b1 \u2228 at p and q are \u03b1 \u2228 and \u2212\u03b1 \u2228 respectively. These curves are isolated.\n\n\nUnbroken maps\n\nNow we need to discuss which stable A-invariant maps give zero contributions. This needs the notion of broken maps by Okounkov and Pandharipande [OP]. The classification of the unbroken maps is identical to the one in the case of the cotangent bundles to a flag variety, see [S].\n\nRecall that X ij is symplectic because it comes from a twistor deformation. We reduced the tangentobstuction theory on the moduli stack M 0,2 X ij , d to make sure that the obstruction bundle doesn't have a non-vanishing cosection with zero A-weight. However, there are two cases than an extra such cosection appears and has no way to cancel with deformation.\n\nLet Z be an algebraic symplectic variety. Consider an A-fixed stable map\n[f : C \u2192 Z] \u2208 M 0,n (Z, d) A\n\u2022 We say that f has a breaking subcurve C \u2282 C if C is contracted by f and the disconnected curve C \\ C has at least two connected components which have positive degree under f .\n\n\u2022 We say that f has a breaking node s \u2208 C, if two non-contracted components C 1 , C 2 \u2282 C meet at s and have tangent weights a 1 , a 2 with a 1 + a 2 = 0.\n\nWe call a stable A-invariant map f : C \u2192 Z broken, if there's at least one broken subcurve or broken node. If a map f is not broken, we call it unbroken. By combinatorial description of the components of M 0,n (Z, d)\n\nA (see [HKK + ]) we get that in any component of M 0,n (Z, d) A either all maps are broken or all maps are unbroken. Both a broken subcurve and a broken node give rise to a non-vanishing cosection of zero A-weight in the obstruction bundle, which implies vanishing of the reduced fundamental cycle on components of broken maps.\n\nLet us return back to the case Z = X ij , n = 2. Then there's a classification of all unbroken maps Proposition 3.4. Let f : C \u2192 X ij be an unbroken map with two fixed points c + , c \u2212 \u2208 C. Then there's exactly two cases 1. C \u2243 P 1 , f is a cover over an A-invariant curve C p \u2032 q \u2032 , branched over A-fixed points p \u2032 , q \u2032 of C p \u2032 q \u2032 ; the two marked points are sent to p \u2032 , q \u2032 .\n\n2. C has two rational components C 0 , C 1 meeting at a node. C 0 is contracted by f to an A-fixed point p \u2032 and has both fixed points. C 1 is mapped by f as C in case 1.\n\nProof. First let us note that two non-contracted components can't meet at a node since by (23) the weights at this node can't sum to 0, so the node would be broken. If there's no contracted component, then it must be the case 1.\n\nThen if there is a contracted curve, it can't have two nodes because then it would be a breaking subcurve. Then by stability it must contain both marked points and one node. The non-contracted component meeting at this node must connect two points and can't meet another component at the other point. We get the case 2.\n\n\nThe integral we want to compute is\nM A 0,(p \u2032 ,q \u2032 ) (X d ,d) red 1\nfor d a multiple of e i \u2212 e j , and we see that we have two cases:\n\n1. If p \u2032 = q \u2032 , then there are only contributions from the case 1 of Proposition 3.4.\n\n2. If p \u2032 = q \u2032 , then there are only contributions from the case 2 of Proposition 3.4.\n\nRemark. The contribution of curves of type 2 in Proposition 3.4 is diagonal, and can be uniquely reconstructed from the equation D * 1 = D.\n\n\nOff-diagonal case\n\nIn this subsection we assume p \u2032 = q \u2032 .\n\nIn this case there is a curve C p \u2032 q \u2032 connecting p \u2032 and q \u2032 if and only if\n\n\u2022 p \u2032 and q \u2032 project to the same point in k =i k =j Gr \u03bb k .\n\n\u2022 Let p \u2032\u2032 and q \u2032\u2032 be the projections to Gr \u03bbi,\u03bbj of p \u2032 and q \u2032 respectively. Then there must be a coroot \u03b1 such that \u03a3 1 (p \u2032\u2032 ) = \u03a3 1 (q \u2032\u2032 ) \u2212 \u03b1.\n\nRemark. The first condition also implies \u03a3 2 (p \u2032\u2032 ) = \u03a3 2 (q \u2032\u2032 ) .\n\nRemark. For the corresponding limit points p, q \u2208 X A we get the relations\n\u2206 i (q) = \u2206 i (p) \u2212 \u03b1, \u2206 j (q) = \u2206 j (p) + \u03b1,(25)\u2206 k (q) = \u2206 k (p) for all k, k = i, k = j,\nwhich is almost the same as the condition to have a non-zero off-diagonal contribution in the classical case (13). The only difference is that now we don't require \u03b1 \u2228 to be positive with respect to some chamber. If p satisfies this condition, the corresponding q also satisfies it. In the classical case the relation was asymmetric, and in the quantum case it becomes symmetric.\n\nRemark. Given p \u2032 and \u03b1 such q \u2032 is unique if it exists. It exists if and only if conditions (23) and (24) are satisfied, or, equivalently, for the corresponding limit point p \u2208 X we have using (15) and (16) \u2206 i (p) , \u03b1 \u2228 = 1,\n\u2206 j (p) , \u03b1 \u2228 = \u22121.(26)\nThese conditions is the same as (15) and (16) in the classical case, again, modulo the requirement on positivity of \u03b1 \u2228 .\n\nThe curve C p \u2032 q \u2032 connecting such p \u2032 and q \u2032 then has projection C 12 p \u2032\u2032 ,\u03b1 \u2228 to Gr \u03bbi,\u03bbj and projects to a point in Gr \u03bb k . The degree by Proposition A.9 is\nK (\u03b1, \u03b1) 2 (e i \u2212 e j ) .\nLet f : C \u223c \u2212 \u2192 C p \u2032 q \u2032 \u2282 X ij be the m-fold cover of C p \u2032 q \u2032 mapping points c + , c \u2212 \u2208 C to p \u2032 and q \u2032 respectively. The degree of f by A.9 is\nd f = m K (\u03b1, \u03b1) 2 (e i \u2212 e j )\n. \nThen [f ] \u2208 M A 0,(p \u2032 ,q \u2032 ) X ij , d fc f = 1 m 1 e A N red [f ]/M 0,(p \u2032 ,q \u2032 ) (X ij ,d f ) ,\nwhere the factor m appears from the automorphisms of f and the N red is the virtual normal bundle in the reduced tangent-obstruction theory. Namely,\nN red [f ]/M 0,(p \u2032 ,q \u2032 ) (X ij ,d f ) = N vir [f ]/M 0,(p \u2032 ,q \u2032 ) (X ij ,d f ) + (C\u03c9 X ij ) \u2228 as virtual A-representations. Torus A preserves \u03c9 X ij , so (C\u03c9 X ij ) \u2228 is a trivial A-representation.\nIt is introduced to cancel a trivial cosection in the obstruction bundle, which enters with negative sign to N vir . We want to show that the reduced virtual normal bundle has no trivial weights. For this we keep track where they appear in the usual virtual normal bundle N vir . Recall that usual N vir is the following[HKK + ]\nN vir [f ]/M 0,(p \u2032 ,q \u2032 ) (X ij ,d f ) = \u2212 Aut (C, c + , c \u2212 , f ) + Def (C, c + , c \u2212 , f ) \u2212 Obs (C, c + , c \u2212 , f ) = \u2212 Aut (C, c + , c \u2212 ) + Def (C, c + , c \u2212 ) + Def (f ) \u2212 Obs (f )\nSince C \u2243 P 1 , the infinitesimal automorphisms Aut (C, c + , c \u2212 ) are 1-dimensional, generated by a vector field on P 1 vanishing at both c + , c \u2212 . This has A-weight 0. The deformations vanish: Def (C, c + , c \u2212 ) = 0, there's only one rational curve with two marked points. Then we look at the deformations and obstructions of f :\nDef (f ) \u2212 Obs (f ) = H 0 C, f * T X ij \u2212 H 1 C, f * T X ij .\nThe map f induces an action on C with respect to a cover of A. With respect to this action the vector bundle f * T X ij is equivariant.\n\nWe will need the following lemma [MO2].\n\nLemma 3.5. Let T be an A-equivariant vector bundle over C without zero weights at the fibers T c+ , T c\u2212 over the fixed points c + , c \u2212 \u2208 C. Then\ne A H 0 (C, T \u2295 T \u2228 ) \u2212 H 1 (C, T \u2295 T \u2228 ) = (\u22121) deg T +rk T +z e A T c+ e A T c\u2212 ,\nwhere z is the number of zero weights in H 1 (C, T \u2295 T \u2228 ). In particular,\nH 0 (C, T \u2295 T \u2228 ) \u2212 H 1 (C, T \u2295 T \u2228 )\nhas no zero weights.\n\nProof. By the splitting principle, it's enough to prove the statement for the case when T is a line bundle: T = L. By symmetry of the expression in terms of exchanging L \u2194 L \u2228 , we assume that L has non-negative degree.\n\nIf L is trivial with weight \u03c7 \u2228 , then deg L = 0, H 1 (C, L \u2297 L \u2228 ) = 0, so z = 0. Moreover, H 0 (C, L \u2297 L \u2228 ) is two-dimensional with weights \u03c7 \u2228 and \u2212\u03c7 \u2228 . Then both sides are \u2212 (\u03c7 \u2228 ) 2 . Now let us assume the degree of L is positive. Let the fibers of T C at the fixed points c + and c \u2212 have weights \u03c9 \u2228 and \u2212\u03c9 \u2228 respectively. It is well-known that then for any equivariant line bundle L on C of positive degree the weights of\nH 0 (C, L) are equidistant L c+ , L c+ \u2212 \u03c9 \u2228 , . . . , L c\u2212 + \u03c9 \u2228 , L c\u2212 ,\nwhere L c+ and L c\u2212 are weights of L at c + and c \u2212 . All weights have multiplicity 1.\n\nFor L \u2228 we have H 0 (C, L \u2228 ) = 0. Using Serre duality, we find that for the line bundle L \u2228 of degree < \u22121 the weights of\nH 1 (C, L \u2228 ) \u2243 H 0 (C, L \u2297 K C ) *\nare also equidistant and of multiplicity 1:\n\u2212L c\u2212 \u2212 \u03c9 \u2228 , \u2212L c\u2212 \u2212 2\u03c9 \u2228 , \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u2212 L c+ + 2\u03c9 \u2228 , \u2212L c+ + \u03c9 \u2228 .\nSince L \u2228 \u2297 K C has negative degree, H 1 (C, L) = 0. If a trivial weight is present in H 0 (C, L) it's also present in H 1 (C, L \u2228 ) by the assumption that L c+ and L c\u2212 are not zero. Then the trivial weights cancel. All other weights in H 1 (C, L \u2228 ) have a corresponding weight in H 0 (C, L) with the opposite sign. So we cancel\ndeg L \u2297 K C + 1 \u2212 z = deg L \u2212 1 \u2212 z\nterms, each gives \u22121 sign. This gives a sign factor\n(\u22121) deg L\u22121\u2212z = (\u22121) deg L+rk L+z .\nThe remaining terms in H 0 (C, L) are L c+ , L c\u2212 which give e A T c+ e A T c\u2212 . This proves the lemma.\n\nSince T X ij has a symplectic structure, we can split it into T X ij \u2243 T \u2295 T \u2228 for some equivariant bundle T . The tangent weights T p \u2032 X ij and T q \u2032 X ij are all non-zero because they are roots, then we are it he setting of Lemma 3.5. The lemma gives that the subspaces of weight 0 in Def (f ) \u2212 Obs (f ) cancel.\n\nThe remaining 1-dimensional Aut (C, c + , c \u2212 ) of zero weight cancel with (C\u03c9 X ij ) \u2228 introduced in the definition of N red\n\n[f ]/M 0,(p \u2032 ,q \u2032 ) (X ij ,d f ) exactly for this cancellation. The Lemma 3.5 gives us even an expression for c f if we choose a splitting of f * T X ij . Let a \u2032 R be the real space associated to ker \u03b1 \u2228 \u2282 a as in previous chapter. We fix a Weyl chamber C \u2032 \u2282 a \u2032 R . Then we have a splitting\nT X ij C p \u2032 q \u2032 = N C \u2032 C p \u2032 q \u2032 /X ij \u2295 N \u03b1 \u2228 C p \u2032 q \u2032 /X ij \u2295 N \u2212C \u2032 C p \u2032 q \u2032 /X ij ,\nwhere N \u03b1 \u2228 C p \u2032 q \u2032 /X ij has all weights which are zero on ker \u03b1 \u2228 . By previous consideration we know that\nN \u03b1 \u2228 C p \u2032 q \u2032 /X ij = T C p \u2032 q \u2032 \u2295 T * C p \u2032 q \u2032 \u2295 V,\nwhere V is a trivial vector bundle pulled back from Gr \u03bb k . Let us choose a Weyl chamber C \u2282 a R adjacent to C \u2032 (that is, we choose whether \u03b1 \u2228 or \u2212\u03b1 \u2228 is positive). Then we can split V with respect to the chamber\nC V = V C \u2295 V \u2212 C .\nThis gives a splitting of T X ij\nC p \u2032 q \u2032 T X ij C p \u2032 q \u2032 = T \u2295 T \u2228 where T = N \u2212C \u2032 C p \u2032 q \u2032 /X ij \u2295 T C p \u2032 q \u2032 \u2295 V \u2212 C .\nThen by Lemma 3.5 we can compute the Euler class\ne A H 0 C, f * T X ij \u2212 H 1 C, f * T X ij = (\u22121) deg f * T +rk T +z e A f * T c+ e A f * T c\u2212 = (\u22121) deg f * T +rk T +z+1 e A N \u2212 C p \u2032 /X ij e A N \u2212 C q \u2032 /X ij ,\nwhere we used that at one of points p \u2032 and q \u2032 the fiber of T is the same as N \u2212 C and at another point is differs by a sign of the weight coming from T C p \u2032 q \u2032 .\n\nFirst we find z. Let us first find all pairs L, L \u2228 of line subbundles in a larger bundle, the tangent bundle of Gr \u03bb (t1,...,t l )\n\n\n28\n\nThe pullback of the tangent bundle from Gr \u03bb k are trivial with no trivial weights. So such pairs of line bundles must be in (the pullback of) T Gr \u03bbi,\u03bbj . Then the weights at the fixed points L p \u2032\u2032 and L q \u2032\u2032 are roots. Moreover, since the degree\ndeg L = C p \u2032\u2032 ,q \u2032\u2032 c A 1 (L) = L p \u2032\u2032 \u2212 L q \u2032\u2032 \u03b1 \u2228\nis an integer, then the weights of L p \u2032 and L q \u2032 must differ by a multiple of \u03b1 \u2228 . A zero weight if H 1 (C, f * L \u2297 f * L \u2228 ) can appear only if 0 is on the line connecting L p \u2032 and L q \u2032 . Then this means that one of this weight must be \u03b1, the other is \u2212\u03b1 \u2228 . ???The multiplicities of \u00b1\u03b1 \u2228 are both 1 by Corollary 2.14. Despite the computations of the multiplicities are done for Gr \u03bbi,\u03bbj \u00b5 , not for Gr \u03bbi,\u03bbj , the multiplicities for \u00b1\u03b1 \u2228 are transferable literally. In the language of Appendix in [D], the only difference is if the Right Boundary Condition is satisfied or not. For the points of Gr \u03bbi,\u03bbj A with \u03a3 2 (p \u2032\u2032 ) , \u03b1 \u2228 = 0, as in our case, the Right Boundary Condition holds as long as the Left Boundary Condition is satisfied. Thus the multiplicity of both \u00b1\u03b1 \u2228 at the tangent space at both p \u2032 and q \u2032 is 1. Then there's at most one pair of subbundles L, L \u2228 which can contribute to z.\n\nOne can easily identify this pair of subbundles. One is the tangent space T C p \u2032 q \u2032 \u2282 T X ij , it has degree 2. The symplectic form gives the dual subbundle of degree \u22122. In particular, this pair is a subbundle in T X ij , not in the larger tangent space we considered. Finally, it gives exactly one zero in H 1 (C, f * L \u2297 f * L \u2228 ), so z = 1.\n\nLet us now find the degree of T . By A-equivariant localization it is\ndeg T = C p \u2032 q \u2032 c A 1 (T ) = \u03b9 * p \u2032 c A 1 (T ) \u2212 \u03b9 * q \u2032 c A 1 (T ) \u03b1 \u2228\nWe know these Chern classes because we know the multiplicities of tangent A-weigths at the limit points p, q \u2208 X from Corollary 2.14. The weights \u03c7 \u2228 coming from counting \u2206 k (p) , \u03c7 \u2228 = \u22121 for k = i, k = j cancel with similar contributions for q, because \u2206 k (p) = \u2206 k (q) for such k. So we only have to take contributions from \u2206 i (p), \u2206 j (p) and similar for q. Denote the sums of these A-weights c i,j,p and c i,j,q and get\ndeg T = c i,j,p \u2212 c i,j,q \u03b1 \u2228 .\nThe are coweights \u2206 i (p), \u2206 i (q), \u2206 j (p) and \u2206 j (q) are in the Weyl orbit of a miniscule coweights, so the conditions (25) imply\n\u2206 i (q) = s \u03b1 \u2206 i (p) \u2206 j (q) = s \u03b1 \u2206 j (p) .\nSince the weight multiplicities are determined by pairing with these coweights, we get\nc i,j,q = s \u03b1 c i,j,p = c i,j,p \u2212 c i,j,p , \u03b1 \u03b1 \u2228 and deg T = c i,j,p , \u03b1 .\nLet us consider contributions to this sum of tangent weights which are in a pair of opposite roots \u00b1\u03b2 \u2228 .\n\n\u2022 Assume first that \u03b2 \u2228 , \u2206 i (p) = \u03b2 \u2228 , \u2206 j (p) = 0.\n\nThen both \u00b1\u03b2 do not contribute to c i,j,p .\n\n\u2022 Now let the root \u03b2 \u2228 which satisfy\n\u03b2 \u2228 , \u2206 i (p) = \u03b2 \u2228 , \u2206 j (p) = 0.\nWithout loss of generality we can assume \u03b2 \u2228 , \u2206 i (p) = \u22121. Then \u03b2 \u2228 contributes 2 \u03b2 \u2228 , \u03b1 \u2208 2Z to deg T . The root \u2212\u03b2 \u2228 does not contribute to c i,j,p .\n\n\u2022 Finally, the root \u03b2 \u2228 which satisfy\n\u03b2 \u2228 , \u2206 i (p) = \u2212 \u03b2 \u2228 , \u2206 j (p) = 0\nWithout loss of generality we can assume \u03b2 \u2228 , \u2206 i (p) = \u22121. The contributes of \u03b2 \u2228 to deg T is \u03b2 \u2228 , \u03b1 via coweight \u2206 i (p) and there is a zero contribution via \u03b4pj. The second root \u2212\u03b2 \u2228 has no contribution via \u2206 i (p) and contributes \u2212\u03b2 \u2228 , \u03b1 via \u2206 j (p). Then the total contribution of the pair \u00b1\u03b2 \u2228 vanishes.\n\nThis proves that the contribution of all roots is even. Then the degree deg T is even, so deg f * T = m deg T is also even.\n\nThe rank rk T is 1 2 dim X ij = 1 2 dim X. Knowing z, deg T and rk T we find the Euler class\ne A H 0 C, f * T X ij \u2212 H 1 C, f * T X ij = (\u22121) dim X/2 e A N \u2212 C p \u2032 /X ij e A N \u2212 C q \u2032 /X ij .\nFinally, we get that for p \u2032 = q \u2032 and effective curve class d = m (e i \u2212 e j ), such that the limits p and q are satisfying (25) for some \u03b1s, not necessary positive (or, equivalently, p \u2032 and q \u2032 are connected by a curve in the deformation to the generic fiber X ij on the wall associated to e i \u2212 e j ) the contribution of the reduced Gromov-Witten invariants is\nStab \u01eb \u2212C (q) , Stab \u01eb C (p) X,red 0,2,m(ei\u2212ej ) = \u01eb q \u01eb p M A 0,(p,q) (X,m(ei\u2212ej )) red 1 = \u01eb q \u01eb p M A 0,(p \u2032 ,q \u2032 ) (X ij ,m(ei\u2212ej )) red 1 = (\u22121) dim X/2 m \u01eb q \u01eb p e A N \u2212 C p \u2032 /X ij e A N \u2212 C q \u2032 /X ij = 1 m \u01eb q \u01eb p e A N \u2212 C p \u2032 /X ij e A N \u2212 C q \u2032 /X ij = 1 m \u01eb q \u01eb p e A N \u2212 C p/X ij e A N \u2212 C q/X ij = \u03c3C ,\u01eb q/X \u03c3C ,\u01eb p/X 1 m = \u03c3 \u01eb p,q 1 m ,\nwhere \u03c3 \u01eb p,q is exactly the same sign as appeared in (14). If p = q and they don't satisfy (25) for these i < j and any \u03b1, then the contribution is zero.\n\nWe summarize the computation of off-diagonal terms. Let p = q be related by 25 for a coroot \u03b1 and i < j. Then the maps connecting p and q give the following off-\nD * q Stab \u01eb C (p) = \u2212 \u221e m=1 q m\u00b7d(i,j,\u03b1) D, m K (\u03b1, \u03b1) 2 (e i \u2212 e j ) \u03c3 \u01eb p,q 1 m Stab \u01eb C (q) + . . . = \u2212 D, e i \u2212 e j q d(i,j,\u03b1) 1 \u2212 q d(i,j,\u03b1) K (\u03b1, \u03b1) 2 \u03c3 \u01eb p,q Stab \u01eb C (q) + . . . = \u2212 D, e i \u2212 e j q d(i,j,\u03b1) 1 \u2212 q d(i,j,\u03b1) Stab \u01eb C \u2126 ij \u03b1,\u01eb p + . . . where d (i, j, \u03b1) = K(\u03b1,\u03b1)\n2 (e i \u2212 e j ), dots stay for terms with Stab \u01eb C (r) for r = q and \u2126 ij \u03b1,\u01eb is the operator defined in (12).\n\n\nDiagonal case\n\nNow let us consider the case p \u2032 = q \u2032 . The computation is quite similar to the off-diagonal case, so we will skip some details.\n\nWe know by Proposition 3.4 that the A-fixed unbroken maps with both marked ponts mapped to\np \u2032 = q \u2032 are f : C \u2192 X ij\nwhere C has two irreducible rational components\nC = C 0 \u222a C 1 , C 0 and C 1 meet at a node s, C 0 is contracted by f to p \u2032 = q \u2032 , both marked points c + , c \u2212 are in C 0 , C 1 m-foldly covers C p \u2032 r \u2032 under f , where r \u2032 \u2208 X ij A . The tangent weight \u03b1 \u2228 of C p \u2032 r \u2032 at p \u2032 uniquely determines r \u2032 .\nThe degree of f by A.9 is \nd f = m K (\u03b1, \u03b1) 2 (e i \u2212 e j ) .c f = 1 m 1 e A N red [f ]/M 0,(p \u2032 ,p \u2032 ) (X ij ,d f ) ,\nwhere N red is the reduced virtual normal bundle, which is the same correction of the virtual normal bundle as before.\n\nThe usual virtual normal bundle to [f ] is\nN vir [f ]/M 0,(p \u2032 ,p \u2032 ) (X ij ,d f ) = \u2212 Aut (C, c + , c \u2212 ) + Def (C, c + , c \u2212 ) + Def (f ) \u2212 Obs (f )\nThe infinitesimal automorphism bundle Aut (C, c + , c \u2212 ) is now 2-dimensional and comes from automorphisms of C 1 preserving the node s. One weight subspace is generated by rotations preserving s and f \u22121 (r \u2032 ). Similarly to the case p \u2032 = q \u2032 , this one has weight 0. The new weight subspace is generated by parallel shifts in A 1 \u2243 C 1 \\ {s}. This one has the same weight as the weight of f * T C p \u2032 r \u2032 at f \u22121 (r \u2032 ), that is \u2212\u03b1 \u2228 /m.\n\nThe deformations Def (C, c + , c \u2212 ) come from the smoothing of the node s. The weight of this deformation is the sum of adjacent tangent weigths 0 + \u03b1 \u2228 /m 31 Then we get\ne A \u2212 Aut (C, c + , c \u2212 ) + Def (C, c + , c \u2212 ) + (C\u03c9 X ij ) \u2228 = \u03b1 \u2228 /m \u2212\u03b1 \u2228 /m = \u22121.\nIn particular, all zero A-weights cancel.\n\nFor the deformations and obstructions we have\nDef (f ) \u2212 Obs (f ) = H 0 C, f * T X ij \u2212 H 1 C, f * T X ij .\nTo compute these sheaf cohomology, let us write the following exact sequence of sheaves\nO C O C0 \u2295 O C1 O s .\nTensoring it with a vector bundle T f * T X ij , we get\nf * T X ij f * T X ij C0 \u2295 f * T X ij C1 f * T X ij s .\nThe associated long exact sequence of sheaf cohomology gives\nDef (f ) \u2212 Obs (f ) = H 0 C 0 , f * T X ij \u2212 H 1 C 0 , f * T X ij + H 0 C 1 , f * T X ij \u2212 H 1 C 1 , f * T X ij \u2212 H 0 s, f * T X ij\nwhere we used that only these cohomologies don't vanish by the dimension of the support. Moreover, f * T X ij C0 is a constant vector bundle with the same weight as f * T X ij s , so\nH 1 C 0 , f * T X ij = 0 and H 0 C 0 , f * T X ij cancels with H 0 s, f * T X ij . We get Def (f ) \u2212 Obs (f ) = H 0 C 1 , f * T X ij \u2212 H 1 C 1 , f * T X ij\nThe map f restricted to C 1 is exactly the same is the off-diagonal case. By applying the same arguments, we get\ne A H 0 C 1 , f * T X ij \u2212 H 1 C 1 , f * T X ij = (\u22121) dim X/2 e A N \u2212 C p \u2032 /X ij e A N \u2212 C r \u2032 /X ij\nIn particular, Def (f ) \u2212 Obs (f ) has no zero weights. Then the Euler class of the reduced virtual normal bundle is\ne A N red [f ]/M 0,(p \u2032 ,p \u2032 ) (X ij ,d f ) = (\u22121) dim X/2+1 e A N \u2212 C p \u2032 /X ij e A N \u2212 C r \u2032 /X ij Finally, the contribution from f to Stab \u01eb \u2212C (p) , Stab \u01eb C (p) X,red 0,2,d f is c f \u01eb p \u01eb p = (\u22121) dim X/2+1 m \u01eb p \u01eb p e A N \u2212 C p \u2032 /X ij e A N \u2212 C r \u2032 /X ij = (\u22121) dim X/2+1 m \u01eb p \u01eb p e A N \u2212 C p/X ij e A N \u2212 C r/X ij = (\u22121) dim X/2+1 m e A N p/X ij e A N \u2212 C p/X ij e A N \u2212 C r/X ij = (\u22121) dim X/2+1 m e A N C p/X ij e A N \u2212 C r/X ij = \u2212 1 m e A N \u2212 C p/X ij e A N \u2212 C r/X ij .\nwhere p, r \u2208 X A are limits of p \u2032 , r \u2032 \u2208 X ij A in the central fiber X.\n\nIn what follows we denote First, we have\n\u03c9 r,p = e A N \u2212 C p/X ij e A N \u2212 C r/X ij \u2208 H * A(1 = p\u2208X A Stab \u01eb C (p) \u01eb p mod\nin H * T (X) loc due to the off-diagonal vanishing and the definition of the stable envelopes. Then we have\nD * q 1 = p\u2208X A D * q Stab \u01eb C (p) \u01eb p mod\nThen we see that contributions of a cover of an irreducible curve connecting p \u2032 and q \u2032 exactly cancels with a diagonal contribution of the same cover with additional rational component contracting to q \u2032 .\n\n\nQuantum multiplication\n\nLet us define operators similar to (11) and (17) used for the purely classical multiplication. Unfortunately, contributions from long and short roots give different contributions to the degree because of the factor K (\u03b1, \u03b1) 2 . This is why we split the operators into two groups\n\u2126 ij 0,st : H * A X A \u2192 H * A X A loc 1 p \u2192 q \u03c9 q,p 1 p\nwhere the summation runs over all q such that p and q satisfy the relation 25 for a short coroot \u03b1 and i < j. Similarly, we define\n\u2126 ij 0,lg : H * A X A \u2192 H * A X A loc 1 p \u2192 2 q \u03c9 q,p 1 p\nwhere the summation runs over all q such that p and q satisfy the relation 25 for a long coroot \u03b1 and i < j.\n\u2126 ij st,\u01eb = \u2126 ij 0,st + \u03b1 short \u2126 ij \u03b1,\u01eb , \u2126 ij lg,\u01eb = \u2126 ij 0,lg + \u03b1 long \u2126 ij \u03b1,\u01eb ,\nwhere by our convention the shortest coroot is normalized as K (\u03b1, \u03b1) = 2. Since we only consider root systems with minuscule weights, long roots appear in types B and C with norm squared equal to 4. The coefficient 2 in the definition of \u2126 ij 0,lg is exactly K (\u03b1, \u03b1) 2 for the long coroots. Now we can sum the computation of this chapter in one statement.\n\nTheorem 3.6. The purely quantum multiplication by a divisor D \u2208 H 2 T Gr \u03bb \u00b5 is given by the following formula\nD * q Stab \u01eb C (p) = \u2212 i<j D, e i \u2212 e j Stab \u01eb C q ei\u2212ej 1 \u2212 q ei\u2212ej \u2126 ij st,\u01eb (p) + q 2(ei\u2212ej ) 1 \u2212 q 2(ei\u2212ej ) \u2126 ij lg,\u01eb (p)\nProof. This follows from the Divisor Equation (19) and the reduction in Proposition 3.2. Then the identification of terms in operators \u2126 ij sh,\u01eb , \u2126 ij lg,\u01eb and the curve contributions found is straightforward.\n\nCorollary 3.7. The purely quantum multiplication by the first Chern classes c T 1 (E i ) in H * T Gr \u03bb \u00b5 is the following\nc T 1 (E i ) * q Stab \u01eb C (p) = \u2212 i<j Stab \u01eb C q ei\u2212ej 1 \u2212 q ei\u2212ej \u2126 ij st,\u01eb (p) + q 2(ei\u2212ej ) 1 \u2212 q 2(ei\u2212ej ) \u2126 ij lg,\u01eb (p) + j<i Stab \u01eb C q ej \u2212ei 1 \u2212 q ej \u2212ei \u2126 ji st,\u01eb (p) + q 2(ej \u2212ei) 1 \u2212 q 2(ej \u2212ei) \u2126 ji lg,\u01eb (p)\nProof. This follows from the definition of classes e i .\n\nA direct computation shows that Lemma 3.8.\n\u2126 ij 0 = \u2126 ij 0,st + \u2126 ij 0,lg + K (\u03bb i , \u03bb j )\nFor simply-laced types ADE all roots are short, so \u2126 ij lg,\u01eb = 0 and\n\u2126 ij \u01eb := \u2126 ij st,\u01eb = \u2126 ij \u01eb \u2212K (\u03bb i , \u03bb j ) , where \u2126 ij \u01eb := \u2126 ij 0,st + \u03b1 \u2126 ij \u03b1,\u01eb = \u2126 ij C,\u01eb + \u2126 ij \u2212C,\u01eb\nfor any Weyl chamber C.\n\nRemark. This explains why we used tilde in the notation for the diagonal contribution operator \u2126 ij 0 in the quantum case: it will differ from the Cartan part of the Casimir operator by a constant shift K (\u03bb i , \u03bb j ).\n\nIn what follows we use notation\nK ij (p) = K (\u03bb i , \u03bb j ) 1 p .\nThen we can write the following formula for the quantum multiplication Theorem 3.9. The quantum multiplication by the first Chern classes c T 1 (E i ) in H * T Gr \u03bb \u00b5 for a simply-laced G is the following\nc T 1 (E i ) * Stab \u01eb C (p) = Stab \u01eb C \uf8ee \uf8f0 H i (p) + j =i q ei \u2126 ij C,\u01eb (p) + q ej \u2126 ij \u2212C,\u01eb (p) q ei \u2212 q ej \uf8f9 \uf8fb \u2212 Stab \u01eb C \uf8ee \uf8f0 j<i q ej K ij (p) q ei \u2212 q ej + j>i q ei K ij (p) q ei \u2212 q ej \uf8f9 \uf8fb ,\nwhere the rational function is assumed to be expanded into a power series in the region |q n | \u226a |q n | iff n < m.\n\nProof. Let us expand the fraction\nq ei \u2126 ij C,\u01eb (p) + q ej \u2126 ij \u2212C,\u01eb (p) q ei \u2212 q ej for i < j. q ei \u2126 ij C,\u01eb (p) + q ej \u2126 ij \u2212C,\u01eb (p) q ei \u2212 q ej = q ei \u2126 ij C,\u01eb (p) + \u2126 ij \u2212C,\u01eb (p) + [q ej \u2212 q ei ] \u2126 ij \u2212C,\u01eb (p) q ei \u2212 q ej = \u2212 \u2126 ij \u2212C,\u01eb (p) + q ei q ei \u2212 q ej \u2126 ij \u01eb (p) = \u2212 \u2126 ij \u2212C,\u01eb (p) \u2212 q ei\u2212ej 1 \u2212 q ei\u2212ej \u2126 ij \u01eb (p) = \u2212 \u2126 ij \u2212C,\u01eb (p) \u2212 q ei\u2212ej 1 \u2212 q ei\u2212ej \u2126 ij \u01eb (p) \u2212 q ei\u2212ej 1 \u2212 q ei\u2212ej K ij (p) .(28)\nSimilarly for the case j < i:\nq ei \u2126 ij C,\u01eb (p) + q ej \u2126 ij \u2212C,\u01eb (p) q ei \u2212 q ej = [q ei \u2212 q ej ] \u2126 ij C,\u01eb (p) + q ej \u2126 ij C,\u01eb (p) + \u2126 ij \u2212C,\u01eb (p) q ei \u2212 q ej = \u2126 ij C,\u01eb (p) + q ej q ei \u2212 q ej \u2126 ij \u01eb (p) = \u2126 ji \u2212C,\u01eb (p) + q ej \u2212ei 1 \u2212 q ej \u2212ei \u2126 ij \u01eb (p) = \u2126 ji \u2212C,\u01eb (p) + q ej \u2212ei 1 \u2212 q ej \u2212ei \u2126 ij \u01eb (p) + q ej \u2212ei 1 \u2212 q ej \u2212ei K ij (p) ,(29)\nwhere we used \u2126 ij C,\u01eb = \u2126 ji \u2212C,\u01eb . Then we see that the first term in (28) and (29) is the classical term in Theorem 2.19. The second term in (28) and (29) is the purely quantum part in Corollary 3.7, expanded in the correct region. The last term in both expressions is exactly compensated by terms with K ij .\n\n\nRepresentation-Theoretic Reformulation\n\n\nTrigonometric Knizhnik-Zamolodchikov connection\n\nFirst let us recall some constructions from representation theory. Let G \u2228 be a semisimple complex connected Lie group and g \u2228 be its Lie algebra. We denote the Cartan subalgebra as h \u2228 \u2282 g \u2228 and the root subspaces with respect to h \u2228 as g \u2228 \u03b1 . Since g \u2228 is simple, it admits a non-degenerate symmetric g \u2228 -invariant pairing\nK (\u2022, \u2022) : g \u2228 \u2297 g \u2228 \u2192 C\nwhich is unique up to scaling. Taking the dual map and identifying (g \u2228 ) * \u2243 g \u2228 via the same symmetric form, we get a g \u2228 -invariant element \u2126 \u2208 g \u2228 \u2297 g \u2228 .\n\nThe image of this element in the universal enveloping algebra U (g \u2228 ) is the quadratic Casimir element. We call \u2126 the Casimir operator. We normalize K (\u2022, \u2022) by the condition that on the longest coroot \u03b1\n\u2228 we have K (\u03b1 \u2228 , \u03b1 \u2228 ) = 2. Since K (\u2022, \u2022) is h \u2228 -invariant, it pairs h \u2228 with h \u2228 and g \u2228 \u03b1 with g \u2228 \u2212\u03b1 .\nThis gives a splitting\n\u2126 = \u2126 0 + \u03b1 \u2126 \u03b1 ,\nwhere\n\u2126 0 \u2208 h \u2228 \u2297 h \u2228 , \u2126 \u03b1 \u2208 g \u2228 \u03b1 \u2297 g \u2228 \u2212\u03b1 .\nLater it is important for us that the definition of \u2126 implies the following normalization conditions\nK (\u2126 \u03b1 ) = 1,(30)K (\u2126 0 ) = rk g \u2228 .(31)\nQuite often the terms operators \u2126 \u03b1 and \u2126 0 are written in the following form\n\u2126 0 = i h i \u2297 h i \u2126 \u03b1 = e \u03b1 \u2297 e \u2212\u03b1\nfor dual bases h i , h i in h \u2228 and a non-trivial e \u03b1 \u2208 g \u2228 \u03b1 . However, by (30) this assumes that K (e \u03b1 , e \u2212\u03b1 ) = 1.\n\nWe use a different normalization later for e \u03b1 , so we prefer not to write it in this form. Now we fix a Weyl chamber C. Then we can define a \"half-Casimir\" operator\n\u2126 C = 1 2 \u2126 0 + \u03b1> C 0 \u2126 \u03b1\nIt is easy to see that \u2126 = \u2126 C + \u2126 \u2212C .\n\nOften this decomposition is made with respect to the dominant chamber C = +, then \u2212C = \u2212 is the antidomimant chamber, and \u2126 = \u2126 + + \u2126 \u2212 .\n\nFor our reasons it's better to keep C arbitrary. Let V 1 , . . . , V l be finite-dimensional complex representations of G \u2228 . Then for any X \u2208 g \u2228 we define the operator X i acting on the tensor product\nV 1 \u2297 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u2297 V l via action of X on V i : X i \u00b7 v 1 \u2297 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u2297 v i \u2297 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u2297 v l = v 1 \u2297 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u2297 X \u00b7 v i \u2297 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u2297 v l\nSimilarly, for any Y \u2208 g \u2228 \u2297 g \u2228 we can define the operator Y ij acting on the same tensor product in such a way, that the first component of Y acts on V i and the second component acts on V j :\nY ij \u00b7 v 1 \u2297 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u2297 v i \u2297 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u2297 v j \u2297 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u2297 v l = k v 1 \u2297 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u2297 Y (1) k v i \u2297 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u2297 Y (2) k v j \u2297 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u2297 v l , where Y = k Y (1) k \u2297 Y (2) k .\nLet us introduce formal variables z 1 , . . . , z l . The trigonometric Knizhnik-Zamolodchikov connection is a collection of differential operators\n\u2207 KZ,C i = z i \u2202 \u2202z i \u2212 H i \u2212 j =i z i \u2126 ij C + z j \u2126 ij \u2212C z i \u2212 z j(32)\non the space\nC[ ](z 1 , . . . , z l ) \u2297 V 1 \u2297 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u2297 V l .\nHere H \u2208 h \u2228 is any element in the Cartan subalgebra. These operators commute.\n\nWe think geometrially about this object as a connection vector bundle with fiber V 1 \u2297 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u2297 V l over the base which is an open part of A l with coordinates z 1 , . . . , z l . Commutativity of the operators means the flatness of the connection.\n\nTo combine the connections for various H in one object, let us extend the base to an open subset of A l \u2297 A (g \u2228 ) \u2243 A l+r , where r is the rank of g \u2228 . If we fix a basis a basis h k in h \u2228 , then A l \u2297 A (g \u2228 ) has coordinates z 1 , . . . , z l and h 1 , . . . , h r , the vectors h k \u2208 h form the dual basis and can be identified with vectors in h \u2228 via K (\u2022, \u2022). The connection in z-direction will be of form (32) with with\nH i = k h k h i k .\nFor the a-direction we use the operators\nH k = h k = i h i k .\nThese are not differential operators, but we need them for comparison. The h \u2228 -invariance of \u2126 C and commutativity of h \u2228 implies that these operators commute. 37\n\nThe commutativity with the Cartan (which are the operators H k ) allows us to restrict these operators from the whole tensor product V 1 \u2297 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u2297 V l in the fiber to its weight subspace\nV 1 \u2297 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u2297 V l [\u00b5] .\nFor further comparison it is convenient to add to the operators \u2207 KZ,C i an extra term\n\u2207 KZ,C i = \u2207 KZ,C i \u2212 2 k h i k H k .\nEquivalently, one replaces H i in (32) by\nH i = H i + 2 k h i k H k .\nAfter restriction to the subspace of weight \u00b5 this gives operators\nH i = H i + 2 k h i k h k , \u00b5 = k h k + 2 K \u00b5, h k h i k .\nThe operators \u2207 KZ,C i still commute because H i and H i differ by a shift in A (h \u2228 ).\n\nTo see explicitly the terms of the quantum multiplication in trigonometric KZ connection it is useful to expand the operator in a power series in the region |z 1 | \u226a |z 2 | \u226a \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u226a |z l |, i.e. write base change this operator as an operator on\nC((z 1 /z 2 . . . z l\u22121 /z l )) \u2297 Sym * (h \u2228 \u2295 C ) \u2297 V 1 \u2297 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u2297 V l [\u00b5]\nThen the connection becomes\n\u2207 KZ,C i = z i \u2202 \u2202z i \u2212 H i \u2212 \uf8ee \uf8f0 j<i \u2126 ji \u2212C \u2212 j>i \u2126 ij \u2212C \uf8f9 \uf8fb \u2212 \uf8ee \uf8f0 j<i (z j /z i ) 1 \u2212 (z j /z i ) \u2126 ij \u2212 j>i (z i /z j ) 1 \u2212 (z i /z j ) \u2126 ij \uf8f9 \uf8fb where one treats fractions x 1 \u2212 x as power series \u221e i=1\nx i . We see that it has almost the same terms as the quantum multiplication. In particular, the first term in brackets in the expansion corresponds to the classical part in the multiplication by a divisor, and the second term in brackets is the quantum correction (modulo some gauge transform).\n\n\nQuantum connection\n\nLet us consider a trivial vector fiber bundle over the affine associated to H 2 T (X) with the fiber QH * T (X). The quantum connection is the following collection of differential operators\n\u2207 Q D = \u2202 D \u2212 D * ,(33)\nwhere D \u2208 H 2 T (X) and the operators \u2202 D act as if formally q d = e d\n\u2202 D q d = D, d q d 38\non q d with d \u2208 H 2 (X, Z), and trivially on q-constant classes H * T (X) \u2282 QH * T (X). The pairing is well-defined if since it vanishes for all constant equivariant classes D, D \u2208 H * T (pt) \u2282 H * T (X). Because of the vanishing of \u2202 D when D \u2208 H * T (pt), we have that for these D the operator \u2207 Q D just multiplies by D and these directions are less interesting. This allows one to reduce base to\nH 2 T (X) / H 2 T (pt) = H 2 (X) ,\nby taking any subspace of H 2 T (X) complementary to H 2 T (pt). From Proposition 2.15 we know that the classes c T 1 (E i ) and a basis in H 2 T (pt) generate H 2 T (X), possibly with some relations.\n\nTaking D i = c T 1 (E i ) in (33) we have differential operators\n\u2207 Q i = q ei \u2202 \u2202q ei \u2212 D i * .\nBy Theorem 3.9 their action on Stab \u01eb C (p) is the following\n\u2207 Q i Stab \u01eb C (p) = \u2212D i * Stab \u01eb C (p) = Stab \u01eb C \uf8ee \uf8f0 \u2212 H i (p) \u2212 j =i q ei \u2126 ij C,\u01eb (p) + q ej \u2126 ij \u2212C,\u01eb (p) q ei \u2212 q ej \uf8f9 \uf8fb + Stab \u01eb C \uf8ee \uf8f0 j<i q ej K ij (p) q ei \u2212 q ej + j>i q ei K ij (p) q ei \u2212 q ej \uf8f9 \uf8fb .\nNow we perform a gauge transform to get rid of terms with K ij . Take\n\u03c8 = \u2212 i<j K (\u03bb i , \u03bb j ) ln 1 \u2212 q ei q ej \u2208 Q[[q d ]].\nThen if we do a gauge transform\n\u2207 Q i = e \u2212\u03c8 \u2207 Q i e \u03c8 = \u2207 Q i + q ei \u2202\u03c8 \u2202q ei and compute q ei \u2202\u03c8 \u2202q ei = \u2212 j<i K (\u03bb i , \u03bb j ) q ej q ei \u2212 q ej \u2212 j>i K (\u03bb i , \u03bb j ) q ei q ei \u2212 q ej , we get \u2207 Q i Stab \u01eb C (p) = Stab \u01eb C \uf8ee \uf8f0 \u2212 H i (p) \u2212 j =i q ei \u2126 ij C,\u01eb (p) + q ej \u2126 ij \u2212C,\u01eb (p) q ei \u2212 q ej \uf8f9 \uf8fb .\nNow the quantum connection has the form almost identical to the one of the trigonometric Knizhnik-Zamolodchikov connection.\n\n\nIdentification\n\nFinally, we show that the quantum connection of Gr \u03bb \u00b5 can be identified with the trigonometric Knizhnik-Zamolodchikov connection. Our assumptions are that G is simply-laced and all \u03bb i in \u03bb = (\u03bb 1 , . . . , \u03bb l )\n\nWe consider the Knizhnik-Zamolodchikov connection on\nV \u03bb \u00b5 = V \u03bb1 \u2297 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u2297 V \u03bb l [\u00b5] ,\nwhere V \u03bbi are irreducible finite dimensional representations with highest weight \u03bb i . 39\n\nThe trigonometric Knizhnik-Zamolodchikov operators act on\nV \u03bb \u00b5 = C((z 1 /z 2 . . . z l\u22121 /z l )) \u2297 Sym * (h \u2228 \u2295 C ) \u2297 V \u03bb \u00b5(34)\nLet us start with writing explicitly the standard generators of U g \u2228 . Fix a Weyl chamber C, let \u03b1 i , 1 \u2264 i \u2264 rk g be the simple roots with respect to C. Then on e \u03b1i , e \u2212\u03b1i , \u03b1 \u2228 i we have the standard relations\n\u03b1 \u2228 i , \u03b1 \u2228 j = 0 [e \u03b1i , e \u2212\u03b1i ] = \u03b1 \u2228 i \u03b1 \u2228 j , e \u00b1\u03b1i = \u03b1 \u2228 j , \u00b1\u03b1 i e \u00b1\u03b1i .\nThis defines e \u00b1\u03b1i uniquely up to scaling via the exponent of the adjoint action of h \u2228 , in particular, e \u03b1i \u2297 e \u2212\u03b1i is defined uniquely. Similarly, if we take e \u03b1 \u2208 g \u2228 \u03b1 such that [e \u03b1 , e \u2212\u03b1 ] = \u03b1 \u2228 , then this uniquely determines e \u03b1 \u2297 e \u2212\u03b1 . The space g \u2228 \u03b1 \u2297 g \u2228 \u2212\u03b1 has dimension one, so e \u03b1 \u2297 e \u2212\u03b1 is a multiple of \u2126 \u03b1 . To figure out the coefficient, look at\nK (\u03b1, \u03b1) = K ([e \u03b1 , e \u2212\u03b1 ] , \u03b1) = K (e \u03b1 , [e \u2212\u03b1 , \u03b1]) = K (e \u03b1 , 2e \u2212\u03b1 ) ,\nand using the normalization (30), we get\ne \u03b1 \u2297 e \u2212\u03b1 = K (\u03b1, \u03b1) 2 \u2126 \u03b1 .\nIn particular, in simply-laced case e \u03b1 \u2297 e \u2212\u03b1 = \u2126 \u03b1 .\n\nThen we pick a basis in V \u03bbi . Since \u03bb i is minuscule, the weights of this representation are W \u03bb i .\n\nLet v \u03bd0 be the highest weight vector with respect to C. Then for any \u03bd \u2208 W \u03bb i we have a sequence \u03bd 0 , \u03bd 1 , . . . , \u03bd i = \u03bd, such that the difference \u03bd j\u22121 \u2212 \u03bd j is a simple root with respect to C. Then we define v \u03bd = e \u03bdi\u2212\u03bdi\u22121 . . . e \u03bd1\u2212\u03bd0 v \u03bd0 .\n\nIf there are different such sequences, then the this vector doesn't depend on such a choice. A straightforwad check shows that for simple\n\u03b1 i and v \u03bd1 \u2297 v \u03bd2 \u2208 V \u03bb1 \u2297 V \u03bb2 e \u03b1i \u2297 e \u03b1i \u00b7 v \u03bd1 \u2297 v \u03bd2 = v \u03bd1+\u03b1i \u2297 v \u03bd2\u2212\u03b1i if \u03bd 1 + \u03b1 i \u2208 W \u03bb 1 and \u03bd 2 \u2212 \u03b1 i \u2208 W \u03bb 2 0 otherwise.\nOn the side of quantum connection we fix the polarization\n\u01eb p = e A N \u2212C p/X\nand we omit it in the notation. Now we are ready to identify the sides. There is an isomorphism\nV \u03bb \u00b5 \u223c \u2212 \u2192 H * Gr \u03bb \u00b5 T , C\ngiven by sending v \u03bd1 \u2297 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u2297 v \u03bd l to 1 p , where p \u2208 Gr \u03bb \u00b5 T is the following:\n\u2206 i (p) = \u03bd i for all i.\nThen we can get a isomorphism\nH T * (pt) loc \u2297 V \u03bb \u00b5 \u223c \u2212 \u2192 H T * Gr \u03bb \u00b5 T , C loc Stab C \u2212 \u2212\u2212\u2212 \u2192 \u223c H T * Gr \u03bb \u00b5 , C loc ,\nwhich we denote by S C . Then the following diagrams\nH T * (pt) loc \u2297 V \u03bb \u00b5 H T * (pt) loc \u2297 V \u03bb \u00b5 H T * Gr \u03bb \u00b5 , C loc H T * Gr \u03bb \u00b5 , C loc \u2126 ij \u03b1 S C S C \u2126 ij \u03b1 H T * (pt) loc \u2297 V \u03bb \u00b5 H T * (pt) loc \u2297 V \u03bb \u00b5 H T * Gr \u03bb \u00b5 , C loc H T * Gr \u03bb \u00b5 , C loc \u2126 ij 0 S C S C \u2126 ij 0\ncommute for a simply-laced G. The operators H i and H i coincide as well.\n\nSending z i to q ei provides a morphism\nV \u03bb \u00b5 \u0592\u2192 C((z 1 /z 2 . . . z l\u22121 /z l )) \u2297 H * T (pt) loc \u2297 V \u03bb \u00b5 S C \u2212 \u2212 \u2192 \u223c QH * T Gr \u03bb \u00b5 , C loc where V \u03bb\n\u00b5 is from (34) and the last arrow becomes an isomophism if there is only one relation on e i . We call this composition S C as well because they are obviously related.\n\nThen we summarize the computations in the main theorem.\n\nTheorem 4.1. For a simply-laced G the quantum connection for Gr \u03bb \u00b5 matches with the trigonometric Knizhnik-Zamolodchikov connection. That is, the following diagram\nV \u03bb \u00b5 V \u03bb \u00b5 H * T Gr \u03bb \u00b5 , C loc H * T Gr \u03bb \u00b5 , C loc \u2207 KZ,C i S C S C \u2207 Q i\n\ncommutes.\n\nA T-equivariant geometry\n\n\nA.1 Walls in equivariant paramenters\n\nWe first need to explain what we mean by \"walls\". Define\nt Q = X * (T) \u2297 Z Q\nFor each point T \u2208 t Q one can define the fixed point locus as X T = X nT , where n \u2208 Z is any integer such that nT \u2208 X * (T). Then for a generic T the fixed locus is X T . The locus where X T is larger is a union of hyperplanes called walls. Let us remind how positions of walls are related to the tangent weights of the fixed locus.\n\nLet us first prove the following auxiliary statement 41\n\nLemma A.1. Let T be a torus and \u03c0 : X \u2192 X 0 be a T-equivariant proper morphism to an affine variety. Assume, moreover, X 0 has the unique T-fixed point x \u2208 X 0 and there is a T-cocharacter \u03bb : C \u00d7 \u2192 T contracting X 0 to x. Then for any T-invariant closed subvariety Y \u2282 X has a T-fixed point.\n\nProof. The image \u03c0 (Y ) is closed T-invariant. By the action of \u03bb on any point, we get that x \u2208 \u03c0 (Y ). So Y intersects non-trivially with \u03c0 \u22121 (x). The then Y \u2229 \u03c0 \u22121 (x) is non-empty and proper, invariant T. Since T is a torus, there is a T-fixed point in Y \u2229 \u03c0 \u22121 (x) (by a theorem due to Borel [B]), and hence in Y .\n\nRemark. We could not apply the theorem from [B] immediately to Y since X is not proper, it only has a proper map to X 0 . However, extra conditions on X 0 allowed us to reduce our case to the well-known result.\n\nRecall that we have such a proper map m \u03bb : Gr \u03bb \u00b5 \u2192 Gr \u03bb \u00b5 to a T-equivariant affine space. By Proposition 2.5 Gr \u03bb \u00b5 is contracted to the unique fixed point by C \u00d7 \u2282 T. So the statement holds for X = Gr \u03bb \u00b5 . Then there's an immediate corollary of Lemma A.1 and computation of tangent weights.\n\nCorollary A.2. Given a T \u2208 t Q the fixed locus X T is greater than X T only if there is an affine root \u03c7 \u2228 = \u03b1 \u2228 + n such that T \u2208 ker \u03c7 \u2228 .\n\nProof. Any component of X T is a closed T-invariant smooth subvariety of X Take any connected component Z \u2282 X T which is not a point. Then by Lemma A.1 it has a T-fixed point p. The tangent space T p Z is not trivial and T p X has only weights of form \u03b1 \u2228 + n . Thus the value of some affine \u03b1 \u2228 + n is zero on T as stated.\n\nRemark. The statement of this Corollary can be formulated in the way that the only walls in t Q are of form \u03b1 \u2228 + n = 0.\n\nThe contraction of Gr \u03bb \u00b5 to the T-fixed point is done by C \u00d7 . Unfortunately, the corresponding cocharacter C \u00d7 \u0592\u2192 T can be on the wall, and, equivalently, the fixed locus is larger than X T . However, there exists a convenient perturbation of the cocharacter. Proposition A.3. There exists a cocharacter \u03c7 \u2208 t Q such that 1. C \u00d7 -action given by (a positive power of ) \u03c7 contracts Gr \u03bb \u00b5 to the unique T-fixed point, 2. \u03c7 is not on the wall, i.e. X \u03c7 = X T .\n\nProof. The global functions on Gr \u03bb \u00b5 is a finitely generated algebra graded by T-weights. The condition 1 is equivalent to saying that all weights of generators have positive value at \u03c7. It's a finite intersection of open sets, hence an open subset of t Q . It's non-empty because the cocharacter C \u00d7 \u0592\u2192 T belongs to it. Finally, there are finitely many walls (hyperplanes) where condition 2 fails. They can't cover a non-empty open set in t Q , so there is \u03c7 that satisfies both conditions.\n\n\nA.2 Affine root subgroups\n\nNow we want to describe the fixed locus of the generic point on a wall, i.e. subvarieties X ker \u03c7 \u2228 \u2282 X.\n\nFor an explicit description of X ker \u03c7 \u2228 we need the SL 2 -subgroups of G (K) corresponding to the affine roots. One could define the SL 2 -subgroups by referring to the fact that G (K) is a quotient of a Kac-Moody group, so it inherits such root subgroups from it. We provide a more explicit description.\n\nFor the group SL 2 let us denote the standard torus as H, the standard Borel and the opposite Borel subgroups as B + and B \u2212 , the corresponding unipotent radicals as U + and U \u2212 .\n\nFix an isomorphism H\n\u223c \u2212 \u2192 C \u00d7 .\nFirst, recall what the SL 2 -subgroups corresponding to non-affine roots. Let \u03b1 \u2228 be a root of G and \u03b1 : C \u00d7 \u2192 A the corresponding coroot. Then there is a homomorphism of algebraic groups\n\u03b9 \u03b1 \u2228 : SL 2 \u2192 G such that the diagram SL 2 G H C \u00d7 A \u03b9 \u03b1 \u2228 \u223c \u03b1\ncommutes. This is unique up to a precomposition with an adjoint action of H on SL 2 . By abuse of notation we use the same notation for\n\u03b9 \u03b1 \u2228 : SL 2 \u2192 G (K)\ngiven by postcomposing with the natural inclusion G \u0592\u2192 G (K). One can construct from \u03b9 \u03b1 \u2228 similar maps for affine roots. Take\nAd t n\u03c9 : SL 2 \u2192 SL 2 (K) a b c d \u2192 a bt n ct \u2212n d\n(even though t \u03c9 is not a well-defined element of SL 2 (K), conjugation by it is well-defined).\n\nThen define \u03b9 \u03b1 \u2228 +n = \u03b9 \u03b1 \u2228 \u2022 Ad t n\u03c9 .\n\nThis maps sends the positive nilpotents of sl 2 (2, C) to t n g \u03b1 \u2228 = g \u03b1 \u2228 +n , as desired.\n\n\nA.3 Invariant curves in Gr\n\nWe use the root subgroups to construct T-invarint curves in a way, similar to the case of ordinary flag variety. Now one can act by the image of SL 2 under \u03b9 \u03b1 \u2228 +n on a T-fixed point [\u03bb]. Denote the orbit as C \u03bb,\u03b1 \u2228 +n = \u03b9 \u03b1 \u2228 +n (SL 2 ) \u00b7 [\u03bb] .\n\nThe Cartan of SL 2 is in the stabilizer of [\u03bb] because the point is T-fixed. By the computation of tangent weights of T [\u03bb] Gr, the positive unipotent radical U + is in the stabilizer iff n \u2265 \u03bb, \u03b1 \u2228 . Similarly, the negative unipotent radical U \u2212 is in the stabilizer iff n \u2264 \u03bb, \u03b1 \u2228 . This gives that the orbit is a point if n = \u03bb, \u03b1 \u2228 , and the following isomorphism if n = \u03bb, \u03b1 \u2228 C \u03bb,\u03b1 \u2228 +n \u2243 SL 2 /B \u00b1 \u2243 P 1 , where B \u00b1 is either B + or B \u2212 , depending if n is greater or lesser than \u03bb, \u03b1 \u2228 . I.e. C \u03bb,\u03b1 \u2228 +n are rational curves in Gr. It's an easy fact that they are T-invariant, and, moreover, all T-invariant curves are of this form.\n\nCurves C \u03bb,\u03b1 \u2228 +n have two T-fixed points. One is, obviously, [\u03bb]. The other is given by the image of (any representative in SL 2 of) the nontrivial element of the Weyl group of SL 2 (N (H)/H \u2243 Z/2Z). A straightforward computation shows that it is [s \u03b1 \u2228 +n \u03bb] the image of \u03bb under the affine Weyl action: s \u03b1 \u2228 +n \u03bb := s \u03b1 \u2228 \u03bb + n\u03b1 = \u03bb + (n \u2212 \u03bb, \u03b1 \u2228 ) \u03b1.\n\nI.e. s \u03b1 \u2228 +n is the reflection preserving \u2022, \u03b1 \u2228 = n hyperplane in the coweight space.\n\nThe tangent weight of C \u03bb,\u03b1 \u2228 +n for n < \u03bb, \u03b1 \u2228 at [\u03bb] is exactly \u03b1 \u2228 + n and it's \u2212(\u03b1 \u2228 + n ) at [s \u03b1 \u2228 +n \u03bb]. For n > \u03bb, \u03b1 \u2228 the weights are exchanged.\n\n\nA.4 Some T-invariant curves in the resolutions of slices\n\nSimilar T-invariant curves in Gr \u03bb \u00b5 can be constructed. Fix i, j such that 0 \u2264 i < j \u2264 l. Consider the following homomorphism \u03b9 i,j \u03b1 \u2228 +n : SL 2 \u2192 G \u00d7l A \u2192 e, . . . , e, \u03b9 \u03b1 \u2228 n A, . . . , \u03b9 \u03b1 \u2228 n A, e, . . . , e , where i is the number of the first nontrivial component and j is the last one. This homomorphism and natural component-wise action of G \u00d7l on Gr \u00d7l gives an SL 2 -action.\n\nTake a T-fixed point p \u2208 Gr \u03bb \u00b5 \u2282 Gr \u00d7l . In general, the orbit under \u03b9 i,j \u03b1 \u2228 +n (SL 2 ) is not contained in Gr \u03bb \u00b5 , conditions are no longer satisfied. However, if \u03a3 i (p) , \u03b1 \u2228 = \u03a3 j (p) , \u03b1 \u2228 = n or \u03a3 i (p) , \u03b1 \u2228 = n and l = j, then the orbit is in Gr \u03bb . This is because the ith component (and jth in the first case) is fixed, and moreover\nL k\u22121 \u03bb k \u2212\u2192 L k =\u21d2 \u03b9 \u03b1 \u2228 n (A) \u00b7 L k\u22121 \u03bb k \u2212\u2192 \u03b9 \u03b1 \u2228 +n (A) \u00b7 L k\nfor any i < k \u2264 j and A \u2208 SL 2 (C). The stabilizer might fail to be greater than H, but if we require in addition \u03a3 k (p) , \u03b1 \u2228 > n for all i < k < j\n\nthen B \u2212 is in the stabilizer. Similarly for \u03a3 k (p) , \u03b1 \u2228 < n for all i < k < j,\n\nwe have B + is in the stabilizer. In these cases of [\u03bb] in Gr \u03bb is P 1 (or a point in a degenerated case j = i + 1 which we ignore). Let us call this curve C ij p,\u03b1 \u2228 +n \u2282 Gr \u03bb . If (35) holds, then the tangent vector to C ij p,\u03b1 \u2228 +n at p corresponds exactly to a segment in the description of tangent vectors in T p Gr \u03bb \u00b5 with weight \u03b1 \u2228 + n . Similar for (36) and the weight equal to \u2212(\u03b1 \u2228 + n ).\n\nThe curve C ij p,\u03b1 \u2228 +n has two points. One is p by construction. Another one is q uniquely determined by conditions: \u03a3 k (q) = s \u03b1 \u2228 +n \u03a3 k (p) if i \u2264 k \u2264 j, \u03a3 k (q) = \u03a3 k (p) otherwise.\n\nGeometrically, this means that one can get the second fixed point by reflecting the part of the path between ith and jth vertex with respect to the hyperplane \u2022, \u03b1 \u2228 = n. See Figure 3 for an example. In this figure G = PSL 3 , the curve C 15 p,\u03b1 \u2228 + in X = Gr (\u03c92,\u03c92,\u03c92,\u03c92,\u03c92,\u03c92) 3\u03c91 connects p, q \u2208 X T with \u2206 (p) = (\u03c9 2 , \u03c9 2 , \u03c9 2 , \u03c9 2 \u2212 \u03c9 1 , \u03c9 2 \u2212 \u03c9 1 , \u03c9 2 \u2212 \u03c9 1 ) and \u2206 (q) = (\u03c9 2 , \u03c9 2 \u2212 \u03c9 1 , \u03c9 2 \u2212 \u03c9 1 , \u03c9 2 , \u03c9 2 , \u03c9 2 \u2212 \u03c9 1 ).\n\nThe last thing we have to care about is if this orbit stays in Gr \u03bb \u00b5 \u2282 Gr \u03bb . If j < l the last component L l is fixed and this is trivially true. If j = l then we have three cases:\n\n\u2022 If n = \u03a3 j (p) , \u03b1 \u2228 then L l is fixed and all C ij p,\u03b1 \u2228 +n is in Gr \u03bb \u00b5 . This case is similar to the j < l case.\n\n\u2022 If n < 0 and (35) holds or n > 0 and (36) holds, then the remaining unipotent radical acts on L l by a subgroup of G 1 . This means that open part of C ij p,\u03b1 \u2228 +n is inside Gr \u03bb \u00b5 . Firstly, this part must be T-invariant. Secondly, it must not contain q (the fixed point of C ij p,\u03b1 \u2228 +n not equal to p) because the affine reflected \u00b5 is not equal to \u00b5. This means that the part of C ij p,\u03b1 \u2228 +n inside Gr \u03bb \u00b5 is C ij p,\u03b1 \u2228 +n \\ {q}, i.e. P 1 \\ {\u221e} \u2243 A 1 . 44 0 \u03c9 1 \u03b1 \u2228 2 \u03c9 2 \u00b5 = 3\u03c9 1 Figure 3: An example of two T-fixed points connected by a curve.\n\n\u2022 In other cases the remaining unipotent radical of SL 2 acts on L l moving it away from Gr \u00b5 . Then p is the only point of C ij p,\u03b1 \u2228 +n inside Gr \u03bb \u00b5 .\n\nRemark. Not all T-invariant curves (even irreducible ones) are of form C ij p,\u03b1 \u2228 +n . However only these (and chains of them) contribute to the quantum multiplication by certain vanishing arguments.\n\nIn the first two cases we'll still call the curve C ij p,\u03b1 \u2228 +n since it won't cause confusion. Now we claim that knowing these actions are enough to construct loci fixed by walls. First remark in that the tangent vectors of T-invariant curves C ij p,\u03b1 \u2228 +n are exactly the \"segments\" in the description of tangent weights. An easy check shows that all \"segments\" are tangent vectors to a curve of form C ij p,\u03b1 \u2228 +n . Remark. The second case for j = l (giving a A 1 -curve) is exactly the case when the corresponding tangent weight \"segment\" goes all the way to the right border and is not zero by the right boundary condition.\n\n\nA.5 All T-invariant curves in the resolutions of slices\n\nThe next crucial remark is that if j 1 \u2264 i 2 , then \u03b9 i1,j1 \u03b1 \u2228 +n1 and \u03b9 i2,j2 \u03b1 \u2228 +n2 commute. In particular, they commute for each pair of affine weights \u00b1 (\u03b1 \u2228 + n ) as long as (36) or (35) are satisfied for each i < j we consider. Simultaneous action on a fixed point p \u2208 X T gives an inclusion map P 1 m \u00d7 A 1 \u0592\u2192 Gr \u03bb \u00b5 (37) if there's a \"segment\" for weights \u00b1 (\u03b1 \u2228 + n ) going all the way to the right boundary, and P 1 m \u0592\u2192 Gr \u03bb \u00b5 (38) otherwise.\n\nThe image is a T-invariant, and at a T-fixed point p the tangent space is equal to T p X ker \u03b1 \u2228 +n (by the combinatorial description Theorem 2.13; it's even more clear from the explicit description of tangent vectors in [D]). Thus the image is an open subvariety of the component of X ker \u03b1 \u2228 +n containing p. Now note that the image is proper over Gr \u03bb \u00b5 : for (38) the image is already proper, and for (37) the projection to Gr \u03bb \u00b5 is exactly the projection to A 1 . So the image is closed. This shows it the whole component of X ker \u03b1 \u2228 +n . By Lemma A.1 any component of X ker \u03b1 \u2228 +n has this form.\n\nThe last touch is to keep track of T action on X ker \u03b1 \u2228 +n . The weights with with T acts on tangent spaces of fixed points of P 1 and A 1 are \u00b1(\u03b1 \u2228 + n ).\n\nLet \u03c7 \u2228 be a non-zero character of T. Then we denote by P 1 \u03c7 \u2228 the projective line P 1 on which T acts fixing points 0 and \u221e in such a way that the weight of T 0 P 1 is \u03c7 \u2228 . Similarly, we denote by A 1 \u03c7 \u2228 the affine line A 1 on which T acts fixing 0 and scaling T 0 A 1 by weight \u03c7 \u2228 .\n\nThen the results on T-walls can be summarized in the following theorem.\n\n\nB.3 Relation between families\n\nThe Beilinson-Drinfeld affine Grassmannian is almost the universal family of deformations for Gr\u03bb \u00b5 . There are \"trivial\" directions (e.g. along the big diagonal) in the Beilinson-Drinfeld base, but after taking the quotient along them we get the universal family. More precisely, by the definition of the universal family we have a pullback from the universal family for X = Gr \u03bb \u00b5 Gr \u03bb \u00b5\nX u A l A H 2 (X, C)(47)\nand the relation between the two families is encoded in the map of bases. We claim that this map is a surjection.\n\nTheorem B.1. The map between bases in (47) comes from a linear surjection. In other words, the universal family if the quotient of the Beilinson-Drinfeld family along some directions in A l .\n\nProof. The C \u00d7 -actions on both families are compatible (both come from scaling the t coordinate), so the map A l \u2192 A H 2 (X, C)\n\nis C \u00d7 -equivaraint. Both affine spaces have coordinate rings generated by linear coordinates, and they have weight . This means that the map (48) comes from a linear map\nC l \u2192 H 2 (X, C)(49)\nThe final step is note that the map dual to (49) is injective H 2 (X, C) \u2192 C l .\n\nThis holds because the basis of H 2 (X, C) is the curve classes comes from the classes of curves C ij p,\u03b1 \u2228 +n by Proposition A.7, and each such curve has a representative in the Beilinson-Drinfeld family for fibers exactly over the wall t i = t j . The linear functions defining such planes are linearly independent if and only if the corresponding homology classes of C ij p,\u03b1 \u2228 +n are linearly independent. This is exactly the injectivity of the dual map.\n\n\nGr \u03bb \u00b5 is a T-invariant subscheme of Gr; 2. The only A-fixed (and T-fixed) point of Gr \u03bb \u00b5 is [\u00b5];\n\n\nT * (G/P \u2212 \u03bd ) (the cotangent bundle of a partial flag variety), where P \u2212 \u03bd is the maximal parabolic corresponding to \u03bd (i.e. the Lie algebra of P \u2212 \u03bd has all roots \u03b1 \u2228 of G satisfying \u03bd, \u03b1 \u2228 \u2264 0). Gr \u03bd+\u03b9\u03bd 0 is the affinization.\n\n\u223c\n= T * (G/B) is the cotangent bundle of full flag variety, Gr n\u03c91 0 is the nilpotent cone and Gr (\u03c91,...\n\nFigure 1 :\n1A typical path associated to a fixed point.\n\n\nNotation. For a fixed point p \u2208 X T there are two related sequences of coweights. Let p = ([0] , [\u00b5 1 ] , . . . , [\u00b5 l\u22121 ] , [\u00b5]) .\n\nFigure 2 :\n2Weight multiplicities in T p X for p represented by the red path P p .\n\nProposition 3. 1 .\n1In the setting above, the embedding M 0,n (X, d) \u2192 M 0,n X, d is an isomorphism of stacks. Under this isomorphism the virtual classes M 0,n (X, d) red = M 0,n X, d vir where the right-hand side is the usual virtual fundamental class associated to X. From both points we see that the virtual dimension of the reduced class M 0,n (X, d) red is the virtual dimension of M 0,n (X, d) vir plus 1.\n\n\nis an isolated point and the unique unbroken map of degree d f connecting p \u2032 and q \u2032 . Let us figure out the A-equivariant reduced fundamental cycle. It is c f times the fundamental class of [f ]. By A-equivariant localization.\n\nFor\neach pair p \u2032 , r \u2032 \u2208 X ij A connected by an A invariant curve, and every positive integer m there is unique such map f . Thus [f ] is an isolated point in M A 0,(p \u2032 ,p \u2032 ) X ij , d f . We are interested in finding the reduced fundamental class at this point. It's c f times the class of the point [f ]. As previously,\n\n\npt) loc the coefficients appearing here. They are the same factors \u03c9 p,q as in the computation of the classical multiplication in [D] and by the same reasoning do not depend on a choice of C as long as it is adjacent to the wall \u03b1 \u2228 = 0. Remark. Let us show how one can derive this result form D * 1 = D \u21d0\u21d2 D * q 1 = 0.\nTheorem A.4.1. X ker \u03c7 \u2228 = X T if \u03c7 \u2228 is not a multiple of \u03b1 \u2228 + n for some root \u03b1 \u2228 and n \u2208 Z.2. Let \u03c7 \u2228 = \u03b1 \u2228 + n , where \u03b1 \u2228 is a root and n \u2208 Z. Then the locus X ker \u03c7 \u2228 as a T-variety is isomorphic to a disjoint union of the following T-varietiesotherwise.Proof. Follows from preceding discussion.Remark. In the statement of Theorem A.4 m = 0 is allowed, giving A 1 \u03c7 \u2228 or a point. Remark. The number m can be determined for each connected component of X ker \u03c7 \u2228 by counting multiplicities of weights \u00b1 (\u03b1 \u2228 + n ) at any fixed point in this component.Proposition A.5. The coordinate lines in(2)and(39)are the curves of form C ij p,\u03b1 \u2228 +n . And, conversely, any curve of form C ij p,\u03b1 \u2228 +n is a coordinate line in X ker \u03b1 \u2228 +n . Proof. Follows directly from the construction.This information is enough to describe T-invariant closed curves. An irreducible closed T-invariant curve C must be scaled with some T-weight \u03c7 \u2228 by T. Then C \u2282 X ker \u03c7 \u2228 and we know all the invariant curves in these simple spaces.Remark. Now we see that T-invariant curves do in general come in families, not isolated. This contradicts one's expectation from well-known examples.A.6 HomologyFollowing Bia lynicki-Birula, let us consider the attractors in X to the T-fixed points. Since X is not proper, action by a generic cocharacter may fail to have every point of X is some of the attractors. However, is we use a cocharacter from Proposition A.3, we can be sure that set-theoreticallywhere Attr \u03c7 (p) is the attractor to p with respect to the C \u00d7 -action given by (a positive power of) \u03c7. X is smooth, so by Bia lynicki-Birula Theorem we have an isomorphism of T-varieties Attr \u03c7 (p) \u2243 A T +\u03c7 p X , where A (T p X) is the affine space associated to a complex vector space T +\u03c7 p X \u2286 T p X spanned by tangent vectors with weights positive with respect to \u03c7. Similar to Morse theory, we define the index ind(p) of p \u2208 X T as ind p = dim T +\u03c7 p X. Let X = X \u222a {\u221e} be the one-point compactification. Note thatFor the sake of uniformity, we set AttrThis means X decomposed into subsets homeomorphic to powers of C. It's not a CW-complex, since the closure of one cell is not, in general, contained in cells of smaller dimension. However, if we order the fixed points by attraction partial order < \u03c7 \u2228 (see[MO2]) with respect to \u03c7 \u2228 , then by definition of the order,Pick any total order < on X refining < \u03c7 \u2228 and number the points with respect to it:The filtration allow us to compute the Borel-Moore homology of X in a way similar to CW case.Proposition A.6.1. The integral Borel-Moore homology H BM * (X, Z) is a free abelian group with even gradings only. The ranks are given bysuch that the image of A p under the natural mapThe natural maps giveThe initial step for us isThe final step is applying the spectral sequence to the filtration (A.6) (or the exact sequence of triple inductively on p i \u2208 X). Using, in addition, that 47\u2022 homology only in even degrees gives that there is no cancellation by differentials,\u2022 an extension of a free abelian group is trivial we get the statement of the proposition. Now we use that the Borel-Moore homology is dual to the ordinary homology. I.e. there is a perfect pairing H BM 2 dim X\u2212k (X, Z) \u00d7 H k (X, Z) \u2192 Z given by the intersection number. This allows us to analyze the second homology.Proposition A.7.1. The curves of form C ij p,\u03b1 \u2228 +n generate H 2 (X, Z) as an abelian group.2. The curves of form C ij p,\u03b1 \u2228 +n generate the submonoid H eff 2 (X, Z) \u2282 H 2 (X, Z) of effective curve classes.Proof. Take p \u2208 X T with ind(p) = dim X \u2212 1. The attractor with respect to \u03c7 to p has dimension dim X \u2212 1, so the attractor C p with respect to \u2212\u03c7 has dimension 1. Let's call the corresponding weight \u03b1 \u2228 + n . Then C p is in the component of X ker \u03b1 \u2228 +n containing p. It's an open subset of a line in 2 or 39. Moreover, because of the construction of \u03c7 the closure is proper, soq \u2208 X T . By the construction of the attraction order, p< \u03c7 q. Finally, since C p is a coordiante line, Proposition A.5 gives us thatNow consider all C p at the same time with the basis A p , all points have index dim X \u2212 1. We havefor all p< \u03c7 q. The intersection pairing with these classes is triangular with 1s on the diagonal. The pairing is prefect, so if A p is a basis, then C q also form a basis. Using that C q have form C ij p,\u03b1 \u2228 +n finishes the proof.Proposition A.8. Let C be an irreducible T-invariant curve connecting p, q \u2208 X A . Let A scale T p C with weight \u03b1 \u2228 . Then the degree of L i restricted to C isProof. By A-equivariant localization and Proposition 2.16 we haveBy dimension argument and using that the Chern classes are in non-localized cohomology, we have that this is in H 0 A (pt, Q) = Q. To find this number, we can pair both numerator and denominator with \u03b1. This gives the statement of the Corollary. 48Recall that H 2 (X, Q) is generated by the first Chern classes by Proposition 2.15. This means that the linear mapis surjective. Dualizing, we get an injectionWe call the standard basis in the target e 1 , . . . , e l . By construction,where the RHS is the Kronecker delta. The image in(40)is determined by the relations on Chern classes. For example, the relationwhich is a standard relation on weights in A l root system. Later we identify the homology classes with a linear combination of e i in the image under (40). However, one should keep in mind that there might be relations between e i 's.Proposition A.9. The homology class of C ij p,\u03b1 \u2228 +n isotherwise. Since pairing with c 1 (E k ) gives coordinates in e k by definition of e k , we get the statement of the Proposition. 49Now we can explicitly find what the effective cone is in term of e k .Corollary A.10.Proof. By Proposition A.7 we know that the effective cone is generated by classes C ij p,\u03b1 \u2228 +n . The classes in Proposition A.9 are sums of e k+1 \u2212 e k with positive coefficients, becauseThis proves the statement.Remark. The classes c 1 (L i ) are closely related to the fundamental weights \u03c9 i in the root system A l . Then the classes c 1 (E i ) are relatives of e i in the same root system, that is the classes for which the roots are written as e i \u2212 e j . By \"related\" here we mean that in the generic case the cohomology classes do form a root system of type A l (there is only one relation) and these cohomology classes match with the weights under this identification.B Deformations of symplectic resolutions B.1 Universal deformationsLet us recall some basics on symplectic resolutions and their deformations. See [K2] for more details.A symplectic resolution is a smooth algebraic variety X equipped with a closed non-degenerate 2-form \u03c9 such that the canonical mapis a birational projective map.Well-known examples of the symplectic resolutions are Du Val singularities, the Hilbert scheme points on a plane (or a Du Val singularity), cotangent bundles to flag varieties, Nakajima quiver varieties. As we mention in the main part of the paper, it's known when the transversal slices in the affine Grassmannian admit a symplectic resolution.X 0 carries a natural structure of (possible singular) Poisson affine scheme. One can pose a question if affine Poisson varieties Gr \u03bb \u00b5 we study admit a symplectic resolution, i.e. a smooth symplectic X with X 0 = Gr \u03bb \u00b5 such that the assumptions above hold. A result in[KWWY]answers this question and we present their result later. Before it let us discuss properties of the symplectic resolutions in general.One rich source of symplectic varieties is the symplectic reduction. Let (Z, \u03c9) be a symplectic variety and let a reductive group G have a Hamiltonian action on it. I.e. let there be a map \u00b5 : Z \u2192 g * ,50where g = Lie G and \u00b5 defines the infinitesimal action of g by vector fields \u2202 \u03be , \u03be \u2208 g, via the Hamilton equationsThe standard extra condition is that \u00b5 is G-equivariant. The G-fixed locus in g * is z * = [g, g] \u22a5 (in particular, if G is a torus, then z * = g * ). For any \u03b6 \u2208 z * we have a G-invariant subvarietyIf the quotient X \u03b6 = \u00b5 \u22121 (\u03b6) /G exists (in GIT Z is replaced by the semistable locus Z ss to achieve this), then it is naturally symplectic. Thus we have constructed a family of varieties over z * X \u2192 z * which is fiberwise symplectic, with a fiber X \u03b6 over \u03b6. Each fiber X \u03b6 is called the symplectic reduction of Z.The symplectic reduction with respect to a torus can be in certain sense inverted[K2]. That is, one can reconstruct the family from a fiber if it is a symplectic resolution. The contruction is called twistor deformation.Let (X, L) be a pair containing a symplectic resolution X and a line bundle L over it. Fix a connected subscheme S \u2282 A 1 containing 0 \u2208 A 1 . Then a twistor deformation Z over the base S is the pair X, L over S with the fiber (X, L) over 0 and a symplectic form \u03c9 Z on the principal C \u00d7 -bundle Z \u2192 X associated to L, that is C \u00d7 -invariant, and the projection Z \u2192 X \u2192 S is (the base change from Lie C \u00d7 \u2243 A 1 to S of) the moment maps for the C \u00d7 -action on Z. In this case X is the symplectic reduction of Z as a fiber over 0.A theorem byKaledin [K], this deformation exists for complex varieties (even more generally, in characteristic 0 case) formally locally, that is for S = Spec C[[z]]. It can be extended to the whole line A 1 .The fiber X s over a point s \u2208 S gets a symplectic form \u03c9 s whose class in de Rham cohomology [\u03c9 s ] \u2208 H 2 X s is [\u03c9 0 ] + s \u00b7 c 1 (L) \u2208 [\u03c9 s ] \u2208 H 2 (X) under identification H * X s \u2243 H * (X) via Guass-Manin connection.One can do twistor deformations with respect to different line bundles. This gives the universal family of deformations[KV]of X as a symplectic variety:over the base which is a subscheme of the affine space associated to Pic (X) \u2297 Z C \u2243 H 2 (X, C). B u contains at least the formal neighborhood of 0. In particular, the space of deformations of (X, \u03c9) as a symplectic variety is finite-dimensional in contrary to the deformations of X as a variety.The map X u \u2192 B u is called the period map. Similarly to the case of 1-parametric deformation, it sends the fiber X u s with a symplectic structure \u03c9 s the de Rham class [\u03c9 s ] \u2208 H 2 (X). Now we are ready to describe the wall structure in H 2 (X). Fix a point s \u2208 H 2 (X) and look at the symplectic variety in the fiber X u s with the natural algebraic symplectic form \u03c9 s . Let C \u2282 X u s be a smooth (algebraic, not topologic) curve. Then the restriction of \u03c9 s to C as a real manifold is trivial because \u03c9 s is C-linear and the tangent space to C is C-dependent. This giveswhere the last expression is the pairing of a homology class with a cohomology class. This gives that a class d \u2208 H 2 (X, Z) can be represented by an algebraic curve only in the fibers over such s \u2208 H 2 (X, C) that d, s = 0. 51In other words, s must lie on the hyperplane defined by d. This implies that for a generic s \u2208 H 2 (X) the fiber X u s has no algebraic curves. This wall structure will be the key ingredient in the computation of the purely quantum part of the multiplication.The resolutions of our interest Gr \u03bb \u00b5 \u2192 Gr \u03bb \u00b5 are conical, i.e. that there is a C \u00d7 -action on X such that the X 0 is scaled to a point by the induced C \u00d7 -action. This allows to show that the universal deformation exists not only in a formal neighborhood, but in the whole affine space A H 2 (X, C) .B.2 Beilinson-Drinfeld GrassmannianBy definition, the affine Grassmannian is the moduli space of local data in a formal neighbourhood of a point. One can allow this point to vary and even have several such points. This gives rise to a moduli space called the Beilinson-Drinfeld affine Grassmannian[BD].Let (t 1 , . . . , t l ) \u2208 A l be l-tuple of points in A 1 . Then we can define the following moduli space similar to(3).with a fiber Gr (t1,...,t l ) . The family Gr is called the Beilinson-Drinfeld Grassmannian. If we set t 1 = \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 = t l = 0, then Gr (0,...,0) \u2243 Gr, by the Beauville-Laszlo Theorem[BL]which allows us to pass to the formal neighborhoods. So the Beilinson-Drinfeld Grassmannian Gr is a deformation of the usual affine Grassmannian Gr.The family Gr is fiberwise Poisson. The Poisson structure again comes from consideration of Manin triples and can be found in[EK].Here we discuss several deformations of familiar spaces associated to the affine Grassmannian Gr. All of them will be deformations over A l obtained by varying points t 1 , . . . , t l . We will use notation of form X for the family over A l and X (t1,...,t l ) for the fiber over (t 1 , . . . , t l ). Now let us define a deformation of Gr \u00b5 . It was defined as on orbit of [\u00b5] under the action of G 1 \u2282 G (K). In geometric terms the action of G (K) meant a change of trivialization \u03d5 by precomposing with a automorphisms of P 0 | D \u00d7 , the subgroup G 1 is the subgroup which doesn't change the behaviour of \u03d5 at \u221e. Informally, Gr \u00b5 is the moduli space of (P, \u03d5) such that the trivialization \u03d5 behaves like t \u00b5 as t \u2192 \u221e.Theare the global functions on A 1 \\ {t 1 , . . . , t l }. Then the analogue if G 1 is G 1,(t1,...,t l ) , the subgroup of all elements in G R (t1,...,t l ) whose limit as t \u2192 \u221e exists and is e:The analogue of [\u00b5] is the equivalence class t \u2212 t 1 \u00b5 \u2208 G R (t1,...,t l ) under an identification similar to G (K) /G (O) for Gr. Note that the G 1,(t1,...,t l ) doesn't change if we choose t \u2212 t i \u00b5 instead of 52 t \u2212 t 1 \u00b5 , because t \u2212 t i \u00b5 t \u2212 t 1 \u2212\u00b5 \u2208 G 1,(t1,...,t l ) . The G 1,(t1,...,t l ) -orbit of t \u2212 t 1 \u00b5 defines Gr \u00b5,(t1,...,t l ) \u2282 Gr (t1,...,t l ) . This gives a family Gr \u00b5 \u2192 A l with Gr \u00b5,(0,...,0) \u2243 Gr \u00b5 , so it is a deformation of Gr \u00b5 . Now we can discuss how Gr \u03bb deforms in this way. It was a condition that at t = 0 the singularity is \"not worse\" than t \u03bb . For every point t \u2208 A 1 we can do the natural restriction of (P, \u03d5) to the formal disks about t \u03c1 t : Gr (t1,...,t l ) \u2192 GrBy definition this is trivial if t = t i for all i, 1 \u2264 i \u2264 l. For t = t i this allows to look at the local behavior of L \u2208 Gr (t1,...,t l ) byIn this case we say that L has Hecke type \u2264 \u03bb at t i . One feature of Gr is that points t i can split and merge as we move along A l . We want the Hecke type to add whenever points merge. So we assign to each i, 1 \u2264 i \u2264 l, a dominant weight \u03bb i and consider a formal linear combination i \u03bb i t i with coefficients in cocharacters X * (A). One can think of this as a divisor colored in cocharacters X * (A). This divisor is \"effective\", i.e. all cocharacters are dominant. For G of rank 1 this will be indeed an effective divisor. We can sum the coefficients of the same point:Then similarly to the case of usual Gr we writefor all t \u2208 A 1 . Then this defines Gr Gr \u03bb(t) .All but finitely many factors are points, so this space is well-defined. We are interested in the transversal slices Gr \u03bb \u00b5 . Their deformation isfor any splitting of \u03bb into a sum of dominant weights \u03bb i .The fibers of (42) have properties, similar to the ones of Gr \u03bb \u00b5 : they are affine, normal, Poisson. If all \u03bb i are minuscule (or zero), then a generic fiber of (42) is smooth. The singular fibers (in particular, Gr \u03bb \u00b5 ) may appear only when t i = t j for some i and j. In other words, we have wallsover which the fibers of (42) might be singular. We can make a simultaneous resolution of (42) similar to resolutions of Gr \u03bb \u00b5 . Let \u03bb 1 , . . . , \u03bb l be an l-tuple of dominant minuscule weights which sum to \u03bb (assuming it exists). Look at the moduli spaceThe family is Gr (\u03bb1,...,\u03bb l ) \u2192 A l is a deformation of Gr (\u03bb1,...,\u03bb l ) . All fibers are smooth.The fibers Gr (\u03bb1,...,\u03bb l ) (t1,...,t l ) have a product structure similar to(41):where \u03bb(t) is the subsequence of (\u03bb 1 , . . . , \u03bb l ) of all \u03bb i such that t i = t. In particular, over a generic point of a wall H ij (i.e. when t i = t j and all other t k are distinct) we have the following fiberThere is a natural map which takes the last element L l m (\u03bb1,...,\u03bb l ) \u2192 Gr Since any fiber Gr i \u03bbiti \u00b5,(t1,...,t l ) over the complement of walls H ij is smooth, the map is an isomorphism in fiber over a generic point. So, outside of the planes H ij the spaces Gr (\u03bb1,...,\u03bb l ) \u00b5,(t1,...,t l ) don't have any curves.These constructions can be equipped with T action. A acts on these spaces by changing the trivializations by global multiplication by A. So it's a fiberwise action. Let C \u00d7 scale all t i simultaneously with weight . This acts on the whole families and A l , making all morphisms coming fromThese A-action and C \u00d7 -action commute, so we can say that we have a T-action. It specializes to the one defined before over (t 1 , . . . , t l ) = (0, . . . , 0), the only C \u00d7 -fixed point of A l . 54In this section we summarize essential facts about A-fixed points of the Beilinson-Drinfeld deformation Gr (\u03bb1,...,\u03bb l ) \u00b5 \u2192 A l and, more importantly, relation of this deformation to the bundles E i . Let us start with the A-fixed points. The A-action is fiberwise, so we can compare the A-fixed points for different fibers.The family of A-fixed pointsis a finite flat morphism, so it makes sense to say that A-fixed points in one fiber correspond to A-fixed points in another fiber. Often we use this fact by saying that an A-fixed point p \u2032 in some fiber has a limit p in the fiber Gr \u03bb \u00b5 over (0, . . . , 0). The A-weights of the tangent bundle ant these points are the same. Finally, under the isomorphism(43)We are interested in the restriction of these line bundles to Gr \u03bb \u00b5 \u2282 Gr \u00d7l which we denote by the same symbols. It's easy to check that on the central fiber Gr \u03bb \u00b5 these line bundles restrict to E i and come with a similar T-equivariant structure.The Beilinson-Drinfeld deformation Gr \u03bb \u00b5 \u2282 Gr \u00d7l is a twistor deformation of Gr \u03bb \u00b5 with respect to E 1 , . . . , E l simultaneously. A shift in the variable t i is a deformation with respect to E i . Since there are relations between the bundles E i (or, equivalently, the first Chern classes c 1 (E i )), some directions become trivial. For example, the relation l i=1 c 1 (E i ) = 0gives that simultaneous shift of all t i by the same quantity gives an isomorphic fiber.By the Proposition 2.15 we know that c 1 (E i ) generate H 2 (X, Q), so the universal base of deformations for Gr \u03bb \u00b5 is a quotient of the Beilinson-Drinfeld base A l by shifts in \"trivial\" directions coming from the relations on c 1 (E i ). We will show it later.Since we know that Gr \u03bb \u00b5 is the period map, any d \u2208 H eff 2 (X, Z) represented by an algebraic curve in a fiber Gr \u03bb \u00b5,(t1,...,t l ) must pair trivially with i t i c 1 (E i ). By the definition of e i over the generic point in the wall H ij we can have only classes d = m (e i \u2212 e j ) for some m.\nKnot categorification from mirror symmetry.
