That it was anything other than benign was very much a possibility in my mind, despite my youth. However, the experiences that Guardian journalist and breast cancer survivor Polly Toynbee portrays in her first play, Breast-previewed last week at the Nottingham Breast Cancer Meetingseem like Mount Everest in comparison with my own.\n\nTwo actresses stand on either side of the stage, with a mammogram projected behind them. Souad Faress plays the central character, a woman who has breast cancer. Leslie Nicol portrays her male doctor, and slips into other characters from time to time. Faress lets out a blood curdling scream within the first minute-this is serious business. Yet it's peppered with sly jokes and, while deadly serious, manages to entertain.\n\nThere are certain universal truths that come through, like the need to blame someone. And when Faress tells her family that she has cancer, it is she who ends up comforting them.\n\nThe doctor ponders what it's like to bring such bad news to women, and says there's no way to break it kindly. He doesn't feel the same empathy with every patient. \"Sometimes I feel tired or bored or not in the mood to feel their pain.\"\n\nThere is a strong political voice in this play. In a monologue near the end, where the doctor ponders the state of the NHS, you can almost hear the voice of Toynbee the political journalist, as if this were an extract from one of her columns. The play is also cleverly injected with bits of science, including a particularly smart description of \"exquisite [cell] division.\"\n\nBut the play is perhaps at its best in examining the notion of patient choice. Faress's character faces the option of lumpectomy or mastectomy. The doctor explains the risks and benefits of both, saying it is Faress's decision. Faress tries to tease an opinion out of him, even guesses what he thinks. The suggestion is that patient choice is not all that it is cracked up to be-sometimes patients want to be guided.\n\nI didn't have breast cancer, or even much of a chance of it. Yet I felt a tiny bit of what it might be like. But 10% of women in the United Kingdom do have it at some point in their lives. This play is an important step towards a better understanding of their plight.\n\n\nAnna Ellis final year medical student, University of Sheffield\n\nT he relationship between doctors and their patients has changed. When discussing treatment, it was doctors who largely decided what options were likely to be appropriate, and what information should be presented to patients. Legal precedent, cultural shifts, and the internet have combined to increase patient access to information about treatment options. In the United States, direct to consumer advertising has accelerated these changes (www.fda.gov/ cder/ddmac/globalsummit2003/). A series of legal decisions has increased the expectation on healthcare professionals to disclose potential risks to patients. Most of the legal material covered by Mazur is north American, but the themes are widely applicable. Long lists of possible adverse effects of treatment are often required, with a focus on risk disclosure. As Mazur demonstrates, however, there has been far less agreement on how this information should be presented, or on the manner in which presentation affects understanding. Doctors and patients can have different views on what information is required. For example, presenting short term survival data may result in different decisions from the use of long term survival data, as may discussing morbidity as well as mortality.\n\nMazur envisages a new type of conversation between doctors and patients, where each brings information to the table. This presents certain challenges. Sources of information may not be ideal. The internet brings information quickly. Healthcare workers are faced with drugs or treatments with which they may not be familiar, and which may have limited track records. Studies are usually conducted with narrowly defined groups, often in tertiary centres. Complementary therapies may have limited traditional evidence bases.\n\nHowever, the genie of increased information access cannot be returned to the lamp. Part of a doctor's role has always been as a learned intermediary who obtains and interprets scientific information for patients. Mazur argues that translating information from scientific to public domains is among the most important stages of knowledge transmission.\n\nMark Tonelli, quoted in the book, argues that evidence based medicine misunderstands the nature of clinical experience when assigning expert opinion to the lowest rung of the evidence hierarchy. He suggests that clinical experience differs from research evidence in kind rather than degree. It is the bridge that allows clinicians to span the gap between scientific evidence and the individual, and to work with their patients to support them in making decisions on their care choices. Seen in this way, incorporating evidence brought by the patient to the consultation is no more than an additional element in the relationship. There may be many challenges in this altered relationship, but it does not seem to be so different after all. \n\n\nPERSONAL VIEWS\n\nReporting risk-that's entertainment W hen I was doctoring, cursing the media was part of the job-like moaning about the General Medical Council or the BMA negotiators. So when I announced that I was going to become a medical journalist, I was prepared for my fellow doctors to accuse me of betrayal and curse me by association. Instead, they cheered me on. I was their special agent going undercover into the enemy camp. Eight years later, here is my dispatch from behind the lines. Reporting risk in the media has been a tougher mission than I thought.\n\nMy most basic intelligence is that journalism-of any sort-is mostly about entertainment. Even news, science articles, or serious medical programmes have to be entertaining if they are to inform and educate, and in the struggle to engage people the journalist's favourite weapon is the story. That doesn't have to mean dumbing down; but human nature dictates that the best stories (think of juicy office gossip) are surprising, unusual, dramatic, or emotive and usually personal-all key ingredients of stories about, for example, killer bugs, the pill scare, and the measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine.\n\nEven when you are committed to covering a scare story (often because other media are), it is still possible to set out the real risks. But there is a feeling in news journalism that numbers are a big turn-off for the audience (unless you are talking money markets, for some reason). So although you might want to say early on in your report that the risk of venous thrombosis from such and such a pill is 30 per 100 000, compared with 15 per 100 000 from another type of pill, the snappy headline usually ends up as \"Pill doubles risk of blood clots.\" You can sneak in the comforting statistics later on, but the seed of worry has already been sown. I used to be a big fan of comparing health risks to the every day gambles that people are more used to grappling with. I even drew up a list: the risks of crossing the road, flying in a plane, or winning the lottery.\n\nBut I would not have been comparing like with like; the stakes are different. As my wife's general practitioner commented on our baby's 1 in 150 risk of having Down's syndrome, \"You wouldn't back a horse at those odds, but if the chances of a plane crashing were that high, you wouldn't venture further than the airport car park.\"\n\nI have always felt more comfortable reporting the less \"sexy,\" bread and butter of real medicine-breast lumps rather than bacterial meningitis. But there is still a duty to entertain and engage the audience, so we often include the patient's voice. The human interest story can work beautifully but it is virtually impossible to find one patient, or even a handful of patients, who can represent the real spread of experiences of a disease. And once you have heard the moving story of a woman who noticed a breast lump in the shower and went on to have a mastectomy, how reassuring is the expert guest who reminds you that 9 out of 10 breast lumps are actually benign?\n\nOne of my other duties as a journalist is to try to be balanced; to represent fairly both or all sides of a debate. So in a discussion about the risks of living near electricity pylons, for instance, there might be a debate between a public health expert reflecting the overwhelming scientific evidence that it is safe and a mother who is convinced that the pylon was to blame for her child's leukaemia. No contest. The expert comes over all clusters and p values, the mother is a real person with a moving story about a child. Well meaning experts can also send out confusing messages about risk just by virtue of their scientific pedigree. It is a rare scientist who will stick his or her neck out and say that pylons are \"safe\" if there is any risk at all, however small. I don't blame them.\n\nSo how can journalists ensure a realistic balance? Some would say that we should deny the anti-pylon lobby groups of this world a voice at all since they are non-expert minorities. Or perhaps give them only a few seconds out of the 10 minute discussion to reflect the balance of opinion? Or only invite pro-pylon experts who are really engaging speakers-a bit like hiring the top barrister? No matter what my personal opinion on the issue, I cannot spin debates in that way.\n\nI don't want to sound like an apologist for bad journalism. I have just found it interesting that even with the best of intentions, reporting health risks in the media is a bit of a minefield. My best guide as I tiptoe through it is the memory of those patients that I used to see in the surgery, worrying themselves sick over a \"good story.\" In the struggle to engage people the journalist's favourite weapon is the story KOBAL: STILL FROM THE FILM BUSINESS WORLD reviews Risk, statistics, and the individual S ix months ago, at the age of 39, I was diagnosed as having rectal cancer. Since then I have had the opportunity to consider the array of risk assessments and statistics that the medical profession presents to patients.\n\n\nGraham Easton\n\nBecause my father had a large bowel malignancy in his 50s, when I had a single episode of rectal bleeding I referred myself directly to a colorectal surgeon. He immediately diagnosed a small rectal lesion, which appeared clinically to be malignant. Following appropriate investigations I underwent major surgery. The risks of such pelvic surgery were clearly explained and I consented to the surgery-I had no realistic choice. But when I subsequently had a variety of unwanted after-effects I was able to recognise that, despite my training and knowledge, I had dealt with the risk of side effects by assuming that they would not happen to me.\n\nThen things got more complicated. The tumour had appeared-and indeed was-very localised with minimal invasion of muscle, but the nearest lymph node (out of 17 removed) was involved. So what then in terms of prognosis and further treatment? Statistics about survival and appropriate treatment are easy to come by, but when I considered how they applied to me things were more confusing. After all, how many 39 year olds with my histopathology were involved in the trials? Does evidence based on mainly older patients with largely more widespread disease apply to me? Possibly not. Even if the evidence relating to adjuvant chemotherapy is applicable to me, it still tells me nothing about my prospects.\n\nI am currently coming to the end of 30 weeks of chemotherapy, with the knowledge that there is only a 10% chance that it is affecting my prognosis. There is a 90% chance that either all the malignant cells have already been excised or that the disease will recur anyway. The information that I want is not that 1 in 10 patients will benefit, but whether I am that one. As that information is unavailable, the evidence seems to be meaningless to me as an individual, while obviously being helpful on a population basis to determine best practice. This, along with three recent BMJ articles, set me to wondering whether we haven't all been bamboozled into believing that statistics and evidence are really relevant in our care of the individual patient. We repeatedly advise patients as to the best treatments for their illness, or for preventing illness, without pointing out that we have no true idea as to whether the treatment will in fact benefit them as an individual.\n\nThe first of these three articles-on identifying and managing patients at low risk of bowel cancer in primary care (BMJ 2003;327:263-5)-inevitably struck a chord. At first it seemed reasonable enough, and then, after further thought, it seemed less a clinical protocol than a tool for managing demand in the population and access to secondary care. The article implies that patients with a low statistical risk of a diagnosis are the acceptable casualties in a war to control demand in an overstretched healthcare system. This view may be justifiable on a population basis, but the attempt to justify its application to the individual patient by his or her general practitioner smacks of a new medical paternalism. Instead of saying, \"It is possible that you have significant disease, but as it is improbable that you have it you will have to bear the risk of waiting and seeing,\" we are supposed to hide the decision not to refer behind statistical evidence of risks and complications, and behind the assertion that \"short delays in diagnosis are unlikely to affect the survival of most patients with bowel cancer.\" I am distrustful of this approach.\n\nUndoubtedly, had I presented to my GP following my rectal bleed, and had she followed the advised protocol, my diagnosis and (at least in my own mind) prognosis would have been significantly adversely affected.\n\nThe second article-regarding the ethical appropriateness of assailing patients with information on risk that is neither requested, nor, because of its population-based origins, necessarily applicable to any individual (BMJ 2003;327:498-500)-further challenges this approach. The third article, which discusses the huge variability of drug response between different patients (BMJ 2003;327:507), further emphasises the hazards of applying risk and statistics to individuals, at least without being far more open about the uncertainty of our knowledge.\n\nI believe that the statistical approach is rapidly eroding the personalised care that patients expect from their general practitioner and that GPs wish to provide. When I return to practice after my treatment, I shall ensure that I focus on the individual in front of me and on my traditional consulting skills. Otherwise we will simply have progressed from telling patients what to do on the basis that we believe we know what is best for them, to telling them what to do on the basis that it is best for the community and the healthcare system.

Would I oversee a sponsored swim in a pool in someone's back garden, with 50 children aged 4 to 17 (and, by the way, they all have diabetes)? Would I fly to South America to escort the wayward offspring of a friend of a friend whose gap year exploits had landed him cocooned in plaster of Paris?\n\nAt one short-staffed school fete, they stationed me on bash the rat where I managed a five hour stint, breaking off periodically to attend to a bilious toddler or pick the gravel from a scraped knee. The only incident that merited recording in the official log book was when I poked myself in the eye with the aerial of the walkie-talkie.\n\nThen there was the unfortunate farmer who had fallen on hard times and (against his better judgment) taken to organising children's birthday parties. He had been up all night lambing, and when our party arrived was up to the elbows in a struggling ewe. With 25 brats demanding his services for donkey rides and hide and seek, I offered my assistance.\n\nI was thinking of holding the leading rein, but he passed me the rubber gloves and galloped away with the parting shot that if a head came down, I was to shove it back and fish around for a pair of hind legs. By the time that he had returned from the treasure hunt, I had delivered quads.\n\nOne of my sons, wise to this kind of improvisation, had the cheek to ask the credentials of the gentleman who came forward when he was stretchered off the rugby pitch.\n\n\"Actually,\" replied the doctor as he administered the bucket and sponge, \"I'm a gynaecologist.\" When all else fails, bluff. A few years back I turned up to run a marathon that started at high noon. Among the crowds I spotted the duty doc-an old chum from medical school who had proved squeamish and retreated into public health immediately after her house jobs.\n\n\"Good grief!\" I said, \"You wouldn't have any idea what to do if one of us collapsed.\" \"True,\" she said, eyeing the cloudless sky and unforgiving sun. \"But I'd know what to do if a thousand of you all collapsed at the same time.\" Trisha Greenhalgh professor of primary health care, University College London reviews\n\n\nWe welcome submissions for the personal view section.
