Standardized science questions require combining an average of 6 facts, and as many as 16 facts, in order to answer and explain, but most existing datasets for multi-hop reasoning focus on combining only two facts, significantly limiting the ability of multi-hop inference algorithms to learn to generate large inferences. In this work we present the second iteration of the WorldTree project, a corpus of 5,114 standardized science exam questions paired with large detailed multi-fact explanations that combine core scientific knowledge and world knowledge. Each explanation is represented as a lexically-connected \u201cexplanation graph\u201d that combines an average of 6 facts drawn from a semi-structured knowledge base of 9,216 facts across 66 tables. We use this explanation corpus to author a set of 344 high-level science domain inference patterns similar to semantic frames supporting multi-hop inference. Together, these resources provide training data and instrumentation for developing many-fact multi-hop inference models for question answering.", "fields_of_study": "[\"Computer Science\"]", "external_ids": {"arxiv": null, "mag": "3031043369", "acl": "2020.lrec-1.671", "pubmed": null, "pubmedcentral": null, "dblp": "conf/lrec/XieTMWMJ20", "doi": null}}, "content": null, "year": 2023, "month": 12, "day": 17}
