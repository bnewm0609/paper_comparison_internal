However, it is labor-expensive and time-consuming to manually annotate the pixel-level full nucleus masks, while it is easier to make point annotations. In this paper, we propose a coarse-to-fine weakly-supervised framework to train the segmentation model from only point annotations to reduce the labor cost of generating pixel-level masks. Our coarse-to-fine strategy can improve segmentation performance progressively in a self-stimulated learning manner. Specifically, to generate coarse segmentation masks, we employ a self-supervision strategy using clustering to perform the binary classification. To avoid trivial solutions, our model is sparsely supervised by annotated positive points and geometric-constrained negative boundaries, via point-to-region spatial expansion and Voronoi partition, respectively. Then, to generate fine segmentation masks, the prior knowledge of edges in the unadorned image is additionally utilized by our proposed contour-sensitive constraint to further tune the nucleus contours. Experimental results on two public datasets show that our model trained with weakly-supervised data (i.e., point annotations) achieves competitive performance compared with the model trained with fully supervised data (i.e., full nucleus masks).
