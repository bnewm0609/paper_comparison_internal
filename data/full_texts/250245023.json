Persisting higher temperature anomalies relative to regional climatology are also often associated with high humidity and can cause severe physiological distress. Besides health impacts, the disastrous effects of heatwaves on the agriculture and energy sector are also well known. Crop growth is negatively impacted by high daytime temperatures and extreme heat stress (Deryng et al. 2014;Siebert and Ewert 2014;Hatfield and Prueger 2015). Similarly, livestock also feels heat stress which reduces their development and productivity (e.g., milk production in dairies and mortality rate in bovines Vitali et al. 2015;Lees et al. 2019). High temperature also increases energy demand, e.g., the need for electricity increases manifolds when there are heatwave-like conditions (Villa 2021). A sudden rise in electricity demand causes an increased burden on the electricity generating companies, which can impact the transmission line capacity. As per the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) of India report (Guleria and Gupta 2018), heatwaves are the cause of high morbidity and mortality in several districts of India during the summer season (May-June).\n\nIn a global warming scenario, hot days are getting hotter and are more frequent, while we are experiencing fewer cold days (Perkins-Kirkpatrick and Lewis 2020). As per the IPCC summary report (Masson-Delmotte et al. 2018), climate change is rapidly progressing and is intensifying. It also says that for a warming of 1.5 \u00b0C, there will be an increase in the frequency of heatwaves associated with longer warm and shorter cold seasons. For warming of 2 \u00b0C, the report predicts that heat extremes would more often reach critical tolerance thresholds for agriculture and health (https:// www. ipcc. ch/ 2021/ 08/ 09/ ar6-wg1-20210 809-pr/). Over the Indian region also, the increasing trend in the past, current, and future scenarios is well documented. Several studies have pointed out an increase in heatwave conditions and its effects on the Indian region, especially on agricultural production and human health (Pai et al. 2013;Panda et al. 2014;Rohini et al. 2016;Mazdiyasni Omid et al. 2017;Chakraborty et al. 2019;Satyanarayana and Rao 2020;Dubey et al. 2021).\n\nHence, monitoring and modeling of heatwaves are of topmost priority for operational use and academic research. Heat Action plans in different countries are based on such efforts. World Meteorological Organization (WMO) does not define heatwave as a global index for modeling and monitoring, and the definition is country-specific. However, there are several objective guidelines endorsed by WMO, followed by all countries. The definition of heatwaves in a broad sense quantifies the duration, extent, and severity (McCarthy et al. 2019). India Meteorological Department (IMD) has been monitoring the heatwave based on specific objective criteria for many decades based on station data. The first criterion is based on the maximum temperature associated with each type of station and the second one accounts for the departure from pentad normal for any pentad. But this way of defining heatwave can only give an idea of rising temperature at the station (or a group of stations) and not the extent to which it will be experienced, i.e., the spatial pattern of heatwave-type of situations cannot be assessed directly or defined systematically. The spatial extent of the heatwave is often considerable, and it affects multiple districts and states. Hence, it becomes essential to determine heatwave conditions in such a way as to incorporate their spatial distribution over India besides the station-wise criteria.\n\nIn recent times, gridded reanalysis are available from different operational meteorological centers worldwide. Gridded data cover the whole globe at regular latitude and longitude intervals and is based on balanced flow dynamics based on dynamical equations. Hence, monitoring weather fields during heatwaves using gridded reanalysis data can provide quantitative information on the spatial extent of heatwave conditions, provided a suitable index is defined. IMD generates gridded temperature data based on station data, and the database now extends for more than 70 years. This study defines a framework for heatwave monitoring and short-term prediction using gridded data. The framework has two major components, as shown in Fig. 1: (a) and (b). Component (a) proposes to use indices based on the gridded temperature data produced at IMD Pune and Relative humidity data (IMDAA data) from a recent reanalysis from the National Centre for Medium-range Weather Forecasting (NCMRWF) to demonstrate the spatial extent of heatwave-type conditions. The heatwave indices defined and proposed by earlier studies with well-defined applications show the validity of these indices (Nairn et al. 2009;Fischer and Sch\u00e4r 2010;Fischer et al. 2011;Perkins and Alexander 2013;Nissan et al. 2017;Nairn and Fawcett 2013). Rohini et al., (2016) have briefly discussed its application and proposed that the same indices could be used for the Indian region. This study examines the applicability of the heatwave indices obtained using gridded data over the Indian region for monitoring purposes in the first component. The monitoring verification is made through case studies using five selected events, and a comparison is made using IMD's existing daily weather (IDWR) report. The five cases are chosen based on the NDMA report (Chapter 2, Figure 4(b) of Guleria and Gupta (2018), which reported high mortality during the heatwave situations over India. In addition to these indices, the current study also proposes the inclusion of moisture or relative humidity-based spatial maps to warn potential health hazards over different regions of India.\n\nIn the second component (b) in the framework, the study proposes a framework to predict the heatwaves in the shortrange using these indices (Fig. 1). The data is prepared based on Indian surface observation data. For this, we have proposed a Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM)-based machine learning model (Hochreiter and Schmidhuber 1997;Gers et al. 1999) to predict the heatwave indices using gridded data. The LSTM models are recurrent memory-based models and find a wide range of applications in time series prediction in the data science field and meteorological time series prediction problems (Yu et al. 2019;Emmert-Streib et al. 2020;Miao et al. 2020;Van Houdt et al. 2020;Ouma et al. 2022). The purpose of the analysis is to describe the heatwaves, their evolution, and trends using trend analysis and predictability and recurrent nature of the indices defined here.\n\n\nData and methodology\n\nFor this, the IMD daily mean gridded surface temperature data (Srivastava et al. 2009) of 1\u00b0 \u00d7 1\u00b0 resolution for a period from 1951 to 2020 has been used. The daily mean surface relative humidity (2 m) and wind at 850 hPa data are obtained from the NCMRWF-IMDAA (Indian Monsoon Data Assimilation and Analysis) reanalysis dataset (Rani As discussed in the introduction, we propose the following empirical model-based framework for monitoring and predicting heatwaves, as shown in Fig. 1. This model framework has two components: (a) and (b). Component (a) is for monitoring purposes, and component (b) is for prediction purposes. Both the components are based on defining a heatwave index. The indices for a grid point as defined for daily temperature (T) values at ith day by Parkins and Alexander (2013) and Rohini et al. (2016) and are shown below:\n\n(i) Excess heat signature index:\n\nT 95 is the 95 percentiles of mean Temperature for the day \"i.\" (ii) Heat Stress index:\n\nwhere the terminology is the same as earlier.\n\n(iii) Excess heat Factor index:\n\nA positive value of the EHF (> 0) indicates the extreme heatwave-like condition.\n\nThe above indices are calculated first. Then they are used to describe the spatial pattern of 5 cases of heatwaves in different parts of India. These five cases are shown in Table 1. The cases are selected for the years when the NDMA has shown high heatwave-related deaths (Fig. 4a of the NDMA report (Guleria and Gupta 2018)). Once we obtain the spatial distribution of the indices for the heatwave, we have\n(1) EHI sig (i) = T i + T i\u22121 + T i\u22122 3 \u2212 T 95\n(2)\nEHI accl , i = T i + T i\u22121 + T i\u22122 3 \u2212 T i\u22123 + \u22ef + T i\u221232 30\n(3) EHF i = max 1, EHI accl,i \u00d7 EHI sig,i examined the prevailing synoptic conditions by analyzing the spatial pattern of surface relative humidity and 850 hPa wind. The daily mean wind and relative humidity fields are generated by taking an average of the 3-hourly datasets from IMDAA. For verification, we will compare the heatwave incidents obtained from these indices with IMD daily weather report (IDWR). This will provide a qualitative verification for the selected cases. Then the trend of these three indices during March-May for the period 1951-2020 is also studied, showing the increase/decrease in amplitude of the extreme heatwaves over different regions of India. The trend would show the increase or decrease in amplitude of the index of extreme heatwaves over different spatial locations of India.\n\nThe Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) based prediction model is used here. The simplest form or the so-called \"Vanilla\" LSTM form, is used. We have used the 'Keras' library, and the prediction model parameters are described in Table 2. The purpose of the prediction exercise is to use the EHF data at any grid during time stepst 0 , t 0 \u2212 1, t 0 \u2212 2 and predict the same up to lead-timet 0 + . We have shown prediction up to lead-time = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 . Statistically, it is a simple lag-regression problem in which the hyperparameters are trained based on a training period , and the trained model is used in the test period (2011)(2012)(2013)(2014)(2015)(2016)(2017)(2018)(2019)(2020). For every grid point, there is a separate model. The plots are shown as a spatial map of the forecast of EHF at any lead-time. The skill of the model is then evaluated using correlation coefficient, and root mean square error (RMSE). The details of the model and results will be discussed in Sect. 3(d).\n\n\nResult\n\nThe indices are calculated using the temperature data. For the implementation of the index for monitoring purposes (component (a) in Fig. 1), first, a few cases of heatwaves  are identified. Then, we have analyzed the spatial extent of extreme conditions during these events. Then, the trend in the three indices is discussed.\n\n\nVerification of heatwave cases using the computed indices\n\nCase studies validate the heat indices and assess their applicability in predicting and evaluating the severity of heatwaves over different parts of India. The selected cases are already well referred to in media, international agencies, and the NDMA report. These cases are also chosen so that these heatwaves affect different parts of India: western India, southern and peninsular part, eastern region, etc.\n\nThe following few sections describe those cases.\n\n\nCase1: Heatwave date 27/05/2020\n\nThe spatial pattern of the heatwave indices for the event, along with the prevailing synoptic conditions, are shown in Fig. 2a-d. Figure 2a, b shows the spatial distribution of EHI sig. and EHI accl with the regions with positive values denoted as the dotted region. Figure 2c shows the pattern of maximum temperature (T max ) overlaid by the excess heat factor (EHF), with the dotted parts showing positive values of EHF. For reference, the 40 \u00b0C temperature contour is also indicated. The prevailed synoptic conditions (relative humidity and surface wind condition) during the heatwave day are shown in Fig. 2d. There was an intense heatwave event on 27/05/2020 with EHF values ranging between 4 and 5 (plot not shown), which was observed over central Rajasthan. From Fig. 2 Similar plots as in Fig. 2 have been plotted for the heatwave event on 25/05/2015 and are shown in Fig. 3. EHI sig (Fig. 3a) with positive values ranging from 1 to 2 are seen over western Gujarat and eastern and southeastern India (coastal Andhra Pradesh to southern parts of West Bengal). A positive heat stress condition is observed all over India except north Jammu and Kashmir and central to the far eastern part of northeastern India. Positive EHF values are observed over west Gujarat, and Andhra Pradesh (coastal and interior parts), with a maximum temperature of above 40 \u00b0C and above, observed over coastal Odisha and West Bengal (Fig. 3c). These regions were found to experience heatwave conditions of considerable intensity (EHF \u2265 3; plot not shown). These condition in coastal Andhra Pradesh was associated with a low relative humidity condition. At the same time, the northern region of Odisha coast and adjoining regions have positive EHF and high relative humidity experiencing oppressiveness with a lesser intensity of heatwave. Similar conditions of oppressiveness with ample humidity conditions and positive EHF values are also noted over western Gujarat. Due to weak westerly winds, moisture supply is less over Uttar Pradesh, and central India experiences a hot, dry climate. It shows that in such situations of ample moisture supply, it becomes essential to monitor humidity conditions also, along with the temperature, for better monitoring of heatwave conditions. As per IDWR, severe heatwave condition was noted at a few places in coastal Andhra Pradesh and a few places in Odisha. In Tuni (coastal AP), a maximum temperature of 47.2 \u00b0C was recorded.\n\n\nCase3: Heatwave date 14/5/2010\n\nThe plots in Fig. 4 analyze the spatial pattern of heat indices and the prevailing synoptic conditions during the heatwave event on 14/5/2010, as in Fig. 2. Positive values for EHI sig can be found over two regions, one over west Rajasthan and adjoining Gujarat (central to the north) and the second one extending over south Maharashtra, Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh, Kerala, and west Tamil Nadu (Fig. 4a). The heat stress is positive all over India, including the northeastern states, as shown in Fig. 4b. Severe heatwave condition has been experienced over the two regions mentioned earlier with positive EHF values (Fig. 4c) in the range 2-3 (values not shown). Rajasthan and the inner Gujarat region show a dry heatwave condition, while the coastal Gujarat experience oppressive conditions due to the supply of moisture. Similar conditions as in coastal Gujarat could be experienced  conditions also occurred in Rajasthan, UP (west), Madhya Pradesh, Gujarat, Haryana, north-central Maharashtra, Marathwada, and Rayalaseema, Tamil Nadu, and north interior Karnataka.\n\n\nCase4: Heatwave date 21/05/2005\n\nThe positive EHI sig and EHF (Fig. 5a, b) conditions for the event on 21/05/2005 can be noted over south Maharashtra, Karnataka, Kerala, and adjoining Tamil Nadu. Meanwhile, positive heat stress is observed all over India except in northeast India, as shown in Fig. 5b. From the prevailing synoptic conditions, it can be seen that extreme dry heatwave conditions are noted over south-central Maharashtra and north interior Karnataka because of low humidity and the maximum temperature reaching 40 \u00b0C. While similar dry heatwave conditions are also noted over north, northwest, and central India, high humidity (RH > 55%) and oppressive conditions are observed over coastal south Maharashtra, coastal Karnataka, Kerala, and adjoining parts of Tamil Nadu (Fig. 5d). Low relative humidity and weak wind field contribute to the dry weather condition over the northwest to central India up to Odisha and Andhra Pradesh.\n\n\nCase5: Heatwave date 12/05/1995\n\nA positive EHI sig and EHF for the event on 12/05/1995 (Fig. 6a, c) is seen over northwestern Gujarat and the neck of northeastern states above Bangladesh. EHF was found to be in the range of 3-4 (map not shown) in northwestern Gujarat (Kutch and Saurashtra) and far western Rajasthan. A positive value of heat stress is seen over northern parts of India, northwest India to east-northeast India through central India, as seen in Fig. 6b. The prevailing conditions show that west Rajasthan and adjoining Gujarat experience an intense heatwave due to the low humidity conditions (40-50%). The adjoining regions such as central and north India (up to east UP) also experience intense heatwave conditions due to even lower humidity conditions (< 35%; Fig. 6d) and the maximum temperature reaching above 40 \u00b0C (Fig. 6c).\n\n\nStatistical properties of heat indices: trend map (spatial) for March-June period (MAMJ)\n\nIt is seen that EHI sig shows (Fig. 7a) positive trend in the month of March over almost all regions of India except some part in north Maharashtra spanning north part of districts Jalgaon, Buldhana, Akola, Amaravati, and the area spanning central Uttar Pradesh to Central Bihar extending southward to the upper northeastern part of Madhya Pradesh (MP), the northern part of Chhattisgarh and Central to western Jharkhand state. In the month of April (Fig. 7b), all Indian regions except the region spanning far eastern UP, Jharkhand, upper eastern Odisha to northeast India have the positive trend of EHI sig . In the month of May (Fig. 7c), Uttarakhand, UP, Bihar, Jharkhand, West Bengal (WB), Chhattisgarh, Odisha, eastern MP, and far east AP have a negative trend of EHI sig , while the rest of India shows positive trend. In the month of June (Fig. 7d) Western India spanning Rajasthan (except northern belt adjoining Punjab and Haryana), Gujarat, west MP, West, and Central Maharashtra, south India spanning Karnataka, Kerala, Tamil Nadu, South to Central AP, and East Indian region from east Odisha, east Jharkhand to northeast India shows a positive trend in EHI sig . Magnitude-wise and by spatial extent (EHI sig ), Rajasthan was leading followed by Gujarat, Kerala, Tamil Nadu, AP, Karnataka, Maharashtra, MP, Odisha, Chhattisgarh lastly, Northeast India. Heat stress (EHI accl ) which is a rise in the mean temperature of the last three days over the last 30 days mean temperature, shows a positive trend in the month of march (Fig. 8a), over the Indian region except for the southern tip of Kerala and another region extending from Central UP to east end Northeast India spanning Bihar, north Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand, WB to Far End North East. For the Month of April, (Fig. 8b), this area of positive trend reduces to the belt extending from Rajasthan, Punjab, Haryana to Kerala and Tamil Nadu spanning North Karnataka, Maharashtra, and MP state. The rest of India shows a negative trend for heat stress. In the month of May, (Fig. 8c), positive heat stress trend further reduced to a region extending from West southwest MP to Upper Kerala Spanning Karnataka, Maharashtra (western and Central), Andhra Pradesh, in addition to the belt extending to Northeast India from Assam. In the Month of June, (Fig. 8d), the eastern region extending from Central UP to central Odisha and Gujarat shows a positive trend.\n\nExcess Heat Factor (EHF) is a measure of heatwave intensity. In the month of March, it shows a negative trend (Fig. 9a) at the Himalayan range at north to eastern belt which extends up to Punjab, upper Haryana, East MP, Central Chhattisgarh, the upper part of Odisha spanning Jharkhand and Bihar in addition to, south MP and adjoining part of North and East Maharashtra. The rest of India shows a positive trend in EHF, especially the western part of Gujarat and Rajasthan shows a significantly positive trend. In the month of April, as in Fig. 9b, excess heat factor shows positive trend in Rajasthan state with the positive trend extending from Rajasthan to MP, Gujarat, Chhattisgarh, Punjab, Himachal Pradesh, Uttarakhand, and up to central UP with a reduced magnitude. This positive trend starts decreasing from Maharashtra to Kerala with less magnitude (moderate) and eastward up to Odisha. The negative trend of EHF is seen in eastern states like Bihar, West Bengal, and the whole North East region of India. In the month of May, shown in Fig. 9c, a negative trend of EHF is seen in Eastern states such as Bihar, West Bengal, Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand, Odisha, UP, Eastern MP, and Eastern part of Uttarakhand. The rest of India shows a moderately positive trend of Excessive Heat factors, including northeastern states. In the month of June (Fig. 9d), this negative trend extends more toward west up to eastern Rajasthan, Central MP and Central \n\n\nPrediction of the heatwave indices using machine learning (LSTM) algorithm\n\nTo see if the indices could be predicted using machine learning model, we have used a vanilla Long-Short-Term-Memory (LSTM) architecture as defined in Table 2 to predict the EHF index during the month of May. The model is employed at each grid point. The model training period is 1951-2010 and the test period is 2011-2020 for the 31 daily values of May. The model uses past three days data [(t), (t \u2212 1), (t \u2212 2)] of EHF and predicts the same up to lead time (t + ), wheret = 1, 2, \u2026 , 6 . The skill of prediction for the test period at different lead-times is shown in Figs. 10 and 11 respectively. Figure 10 shows the spatial pattern of correlation skill and Fig. 11 shows the root mean square error (RMSE). The correlation plot shows that the skill decreases drastically as the lead time increases. The effective skill of 0.7 and above (representing ~ 50% variance in the data) for up to 3 days can be observed and skill reduces for higher lead times. The RMSE increase as the lead-time increases. It may be noted that there is a higher RMSE in the model over the north west India. The low pan India prediction skill up to 4-5 days or so indicates that the raw model has to be refined further. Within India, the prediction skill of 0.6 and above is observed over northern states north of 20\u00b0 N up to 5-6 days of lead-time. Thus, the plot indicates that we have better predictability for the north Indian states. The reason will be explored in a latter study. We have compared the prediction skill of this model with a simple linear regression-based model. The improvement is marginal (result not shown). Figure 12 shows an example of the predicted time series of EHF using the LSTM model for a grid over Ajmer in the state of Rajasthan representing an arid location. It can be seen that the strong heatwave over Rajasthan during the end of May as shown in Fig. 2 is captured efficiently up to 2-3 lead days in the model. More work is required to understand the predictability of the EHF index and improve this model.\n\n\nDiscussion\n\nThis study proposes a framework of heatwave tracking (monitoring) and prediction using gridded data (maximum and minimum temperature, humidity, and wind The prediction using LSTM model is performed at each (x, y) grid point and the spatial map of skill is computed. Certain grid points where data is not available for every year, it is skipped in computation 1 3 data) for the Indian region. The framework has two main components as shown in Fig. 1. The first component is monitoring which is done using few pre-defined heatwave indices (Sect. 2). Verification of the component (a) is done by selecting five cases of severe heatwaves based on an existing NDMA report and is compared with the India daily weather Report (IDWR) of the India Meteorological Department (IMD). It is observed that its first three cases are matching perfectly with the IDWR description for a heatwave for that day. In the case of Event1, (for the heatwave date 27/05/2020, as per IDWR, heatwave condition occurs at isolated pockets over different locations, namely, west Rajasthan, Haryana, Delhi, and East Uttar Pradesh, Vidarbha, north Madhya Pradesh, Marathwada, West Uttar Pradesh (UP) and isolated pockets of Saurashtra. The figure based on computed indices, Fig. 2c, shows that the spatial extent of Event-1 defined by these indices reflects the belts of heatwave conditions very precisely when compared to the IMD daily weather reports. In the case of Event2, (heatwave date 25/05/2015), as per IDWR, severe heatwave condition occurred at coastal Andhra Pradesh (AP) and a few places of Odisha. The Maximum temperature of 47.2 \u00b0C was recorded at Tuni (Coastal AP). The heatwave indices were able to capture the geospatial extent of the severity of the extreme event (Fig. 3c). In the case of Event3 (Heatwave date 14/05/2010), as per IDWR, severe heatwave condition occurred in some parts of the state of Bihar. Heatwave condition also prevailed at different states and meteorological subdivisions namely, Rajasthan, UP (west), Madhya Pradesh, Gujarat, Haryana, North Madhya Maharashtra, Marathwada, Rayalaseema, Tamil Nadu, and North Interior Karnataka. Figure 4a, c establishes its accuracy. In addition to these three indices, we had also studied the wind and humidity profile on the days for the above cases (Fig. 2, 3, 4d). It is seen that humidity plays an essential role in assessing comfortability at that place. Winds are agents of the transport of moisture at a place. Westerly winds play an important role in deciding the effect of heatwaves. High humidity (RH%) with EFH \u2265 0 may give rise to discomfort; oppressive conditions are seen along the coastline while interior regions are prone to low humidity conditions which leads to dry and intense heatwave conditions. These indices are also studied with their trends. It is seen that heat indices show increasing trends over Northwest and western India extending toward the southern peninsula through central and west India for the months of April and May month prominently (Figs. 7,8,9).\n\nWe propose to use the index-based method for day-today (operational) work so that we can track heatwaves as mentioned in Fig. 1. We also studied the synoptic conditions based on wind and humidity on specific regions using wind and humidity profiles generated using spatial images. To operationalize this study, we require gridded data for the current day (maximum and minimum temperature), which is generated by IMD-Pune on a regular basis. In addition to this, we need humidity and wind profile data. For this study, we have used the humidity and wind data generated by NCMRWF (IMDAA dataset) to assess the heatwave effect in the Indian region and potential health hazards. The same variables are also required to be available on a realtime basis to include excess humidity maps over the Indian region. Finally, to implement component (b) (in Fig. 1) we have used a vanilla LSTM model to understand the empirical prediction skill of these indices. The analysis indicates that the prediction skill of the LSTM model is modest with higher correlation values persisting over northern India up to 5-6 lead days. We propose to use and improve this machine learning model for future operational studies.\n\n\nDeclarations\n\nConflict of interest Authors declare that there is no conflict of interest.

The area under heat stress are Rajasthan (central and western parts), Eastern and Central Gujarat, Central and Western Maharashtra, Karnataka, Kerala, and the Western part of Tamil Nadu adjoining Kerala. To understand the prevailing synoptic conditions, we have analyzed the surface relative humidity and wind (850 hPa) obtained from IMDAA(Fig. 2d). The westerly wind over regions such as Chhattisgarh, Madhya Pradesh (MP), Rajasthan, and Punjab leads to dry heatwave conditions. At the same time, coastal Gujarat, Maharashtra, Karnataka, Kerala, and west Tamil Nadu show increased surface humidity conditions, in addition to the excess EHF leading to oppressive conditions and is a cause of potential health hazards. The northeastern states through western Uttar Pradesh (UP), Jharkhand, Bihar, and the southern tip of Kerala have excess moisture and negative EHF values. The official IMD press release (imd.gov.in (IMD, 2020) also mentioned these heatwave conditions over the Indian region. As per IDWR for this event, the heatwave condition occurred at isolated pockets over different locations, west Rajasthan, Haryana, Delhi, east Uttar Pradesh (UP) Vidarbha, north Madhya Pradesh, Marathwada, West UP, and Saurashtra.Case2: Heatwave date 25/05/2015 \n\n\nAcknowledgements Authors acknowledge the anonymous Reviewer/s for constructive comments.
