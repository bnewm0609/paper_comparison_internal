(2004). The lack of empirical studies conducted in East-Asian societies makes it difficult, if not impossible, to shed light on multi-cultural differences in information privacy concerns of internet users. Therefore, we collected data of more than 9,000 Japanese respondents to conduct a conceptual replication of the IUIPC model. For our research goal, we re-assess the validity and reliability of the IUIPC model for Japan and compare the results with internet users' privacy concerns in the USA. Our results indicate that the second-order IUIPC construct, measured reflectively through the constructs awareness, collection, and control, is reliable and valid. Furthermore, three out of the five structural paths of the IUIPC model were confirmed for our Japanese sample. In contrast to the original study, the impact of IUIPC on trusting beliefs, as well as that of trusting beliefs on risk beliefs was negligible. Statistically significant differences in the IUIPC could only be found for the covariate gender.\n\nIntroduction\n\nWith the information society in the digital age and personal data being referred to as the new oil, privacy and people's attitude about sharing personal data take an important role to retain self-determination with regard to one's personal information. Therefore, determining the factors influencing the privacy behavior of individuals has become a pivotal aspect in information-oriented societies. In particular, observing what influences individuals to disclose their personal data in spite of their concerns for privacy is a significant line of analysis.\n\nOne popular model in the privacy literature that tries to explain privacy concerns of online users is the one including the Internet Users' Information Privacy Concerns (IUIPC) construct by Malhotra et al. (2004), using data collected in the United States of America (USA). Their research targets involve a theoretical framework and an instrument for operationalizing privacy concerns (IUIPC) as well as a causal model for this construct. Their hypotheses, replicated fully in Section 2, involve the direct effect of IUIPC on trusting and risk beliefs, and the mediated effect on the intention of self-disclosure. The results of the analysis of Malhotra et al. (2004) suggest that the privacy concerns of users are reflected in a second-order construct with three main constructs: information collection, control, and awareness of privacy practices. In turn, the construct Internet Users' Information Privacy Concerns (IUIPC) has a statistically significant effect on the intention to selfdisclose, which is mediated by the trust and risk beliefs of the users. These results are presented in  Several factors such as cultural differences (Wang, Norice, & Cranor, 2011) or different legislation between countries (Ishii and Komukai, 2016) are assumed to have decisive impact on individuals' privacy behavior. In this context, it is noteworthy that many papers do not consider this impact and just focus on Western societies (e.g. Europe or USA). Therefore, we chose Japan as a sample population for our research, as the existing literature shows significant cultural and societal differences to the views represented in the USA society. On the other hand, as the latest privacy incidents show, people in both countries are concerned about data leaks. Recent examples for such incidents in Japan are the Benesse case 1 in 2014, where a data leak affected more than 20 million people, and the leak of 1.25 million cases from Japan Pension Service staff computers 2 was discovered in 2015.\n\nDue to the use prevalence of the IUIPC model and deviations which may occur across nations and across time, it is relevant to evaluate the validity of the IUIPC model in new contexts. This was already noticed by Malhotra et al. (2004, pg. 350): \"Thus it remains to be seen whether or not the results of this study retain their validity with different contextual variables.\" and \" [\u2026] the data collected for this study was specific to a given geographic location \u2026 care must be taken in any effort to generalize our findings beyond the boundary 1 https://www.japantoday.com/category/national/view/1789-file-y100-mil-damages-suit-against-benesseover-data-leak 2 https://www.databreaches.net/japans-pension-system-hacked-1-25-million-cases-of-personal-data-leaked/ AIS Transactions on Replication Research 3 Volume 6 Paper 18 of our sample.\" Thus, through a re-assessment of the same model in a country with different privacy views and at a later point in time, we aim to provide valuable insights on the general applicability of the model.\n\n\nBackground and Prior Replications\n\nPrivacy concern operationalizations and models have been integrated in various studies. Besides IUIPC, another instrument to measure information privacy concerns is the concern for information privacy (CFIP) by Smith et al. (1996) which was restructured by Stewart and Segars (2002). CFIP consists of four dimensions: collection, unauthorized secondary use, improper access, and errors. IUIPC is comprised of three dimensions: collection, control, and awareness. Since CFIP and IUIPC overlap in the collection dimension, combined they include six dimensions. According to Hong and Thong (2013), these six dimensions are the most popular dimensions in the existing literature.\n\nBelanger and Crossler (2011) point out that even though Malhotra et al. (2004) showed that IUIPC explains more of the variance in a person's willingness to transact than CFIP, CFIP is still more widely used (cf. Osatuyi, 2015). Hong and Thong (2013) combined CFIP and IUIPC to develop the six-dimensional Internet Privacy Concerns (IPC) measure. Thus, with respect to the model of Malhotra et al. (2004), replication studies are scarce.\n\nA closely related study investigating IUIPC is the one by Sipior et al. (2013) which confirms the constructs and most relationships within the model, but does not use structural equation modelling. The relationships which were not confirmed by Sipiro et al. are those between IUIPC and risk beliefs, and trusting beliefs, respectively. This finding can impact the quality of the IUIPC model, as trusting and risk beliefs are mediators of the relationship between IUIPC and the intention to share. However, the study of Sipior et al. (2013) only had a small sample size (63 respondents) and also was conducted in the USA. They conclude that IUIPC is not a valid scale for measuring privacy concerns.\n\nWe only found two applications of the IUIPC construct in Japan, the sample country of our analysis. Okazaki et al. (2009) aim to evaluate privacy concerns and their impact on preferences for regulatory control in mobile advertising. The authors adapt the initial IUIPC model by adding, for example, a construct for negative past experiences, which they hypothesize to influence the privacy concerns. In a second paper Okazaki et al. (2012) focus on consumers' acceptance of mobile advertising by considering the effects of perceived ubiquity. However, in addition to a smaller sample (510), Okazaki et al. focus on mobile advertising and therefore have a more limited scope than we have. Zukowski and Brown (2007) investigated the influence of demographic factors on IUIPC with 199 internet users from South Africa. However, they did not include trust and risk beliefs or any kind of behavioral intention construct. Yang and Miao (2008) studied the influence of IUIPC on users' intention to transact online in China. However, they only included trust beliefs and do not use risk beliefs in their research model. Nov and Wattal (2009) extended IUIPC with constructs for social norms and trust in community members and examined 192 Flickr users. Harborth and Pape investigated the influence of IUIPC on users' behavioral intentions to use privacy enhancing technologies (PET), namely JonDonym (Harborth and Pape, 2018) and Tor (Harborth and Pape, 2019). They also had a smaller sample size (141 and 124 users, respectively), a more limited focus on PET users and they extended the model of IUIPC by considering trust in the service provider of the PET. The remainder of this paper is organized as follows: in the next section, we discuss our research hypotheses. Section 3 outlines our methodology. Section 4 presents the results. A discussion and concluding remarks, along with some limitations and threats to validity are included in the final section.\n\n\nResearch Hypotheses\n\nThe research hypotheses of Malhotra et al. (2004) regard the coefficients of the causal (inner) model, which we present in this section. However, in order to replicate the inner model, the constructs need to be measured adequately, and fulfil reliability and validity criteria. Analyzing causal models for which IUIPC is used requires an analysis of how well IUIPC is measured. The replications we found mostly confirmed the IUIPC construct, expressed by data collection concerns, control over the user data, and awareness of privacy.\n\nExisting literature indicates privacy differences between Western and Eastern societies (Mizutani, Dorsey, & Moor, 2004;Nakada and Tamura, 2005;Orito and Murata, 2005). For the understanding of privacy concerns in Japan it is helpful to have a look on the related legal framework. As emphasized by Tschersich et al. (2016) the legislation is centered around the \"Act on the Protection of Personal Information\", which was implemented in 2005. Recent work by Ishii and Komukai (2016) focuses on the liability and duties of data controllers regarding data leaks and compares the relevant legal schemes of Japan, the U.S., and the U.K. Other scientific contributions evaluate the evolution of privacy as a legal concept, and how the aforementioned act enforced it in various fields of the Japanese economy (Miyashita, 2011). In particular, Adams et al. (2009), discuss the Japanese sense of information privacy by distinguishing information privacy and physical privacy. They show evidence that social norms change from traditional values to limiting the sharing and use of personal information and developing legal responses for the breakdown of these norms. There is more work on the Japanese concept of privacy published in national venues, but unfortunately it is not published in English.\n\nA primary contrast between Eastern and Western cultures is the relative focus on the good-of-the-group (collectivism) in the East versus the good-of-the-individual (individualism) in the West (Ralston, Holt, Terpstra, & Kai-cheng, 1997). Morris et al. (1994) claim that collectivism can be viewed as the subordination of personal goals under the goals of the group with an emphasis on sharing and harmony. Results by Cockcroft and Heales (2005) indicate that group collectivism has a considerable influence on the relationships within the IUIPC model, but they only had a sample size of 27. Chow et al. (1999) compare cultural factors for information sharing by interviewing managers in Taiwan and in Australia. Their results show a \"sense of collective responsibility [...] to share information for the good of the company, even if doing so was potentially disadvantageous for the person concerned\" for the Taiwanese respondents. Shin et al. (2007) show a positive relationship between collectivism and the attitude towards information sharing in China.\n\nAIS Transactions on Replication Research 5 Volume 6\n\nPaper 18\n\nFurther findings, e.g. from Orito and Murata (2005) underline that privacy is a \"subjective and timeserving concept\" (p. 1), resulting in a lesser expectation for privacy protection. They also invoke a linguistic argument, based on the fact that there is no Japanese word for privacy. As the word for that is an adapted English word, the authors expect it to conjure less meaning than it would to native speakers. As a consequence, a different perception of privacy between Japan and Western societies arises. In order to evaluate such differences, the model of Malhotra et al. (2004) can offer more explicit effects by investigating the mediators (trusting and risk beliefs). When forming our research hypotheses, we considered their results as well as the IUIPC re-testing results of Sipior et al. (2013). Although both studies were conducted in the USA, it was the best starting point to derive the hypotheses for our sample. The different results of these two papers are the relationships between IUIPC and risk beliefs, and between IUIPC and trust beliefs. Hypothesis 5: Risk beliefs will have a negative effect on the willingness to share.\n\nNote that hypothesis 1, 2 and 3 remain unchanged, while hypothesis 4 and 5 reflect that we used \"willingness to share\" instead of \"intention to give/release information\" by Malhotra et al. for measuring the users' intentions. The reason for this deviation from the original model is to ensure a more general applicability of our claims and to focus on the basic relationship between privacy concerns and the willingness to share. The original study is focused on individuals engaging in e-commerce transactions. However, there can be other reasons to share information, e.g. social networks or information which is valuable to the society, such as medical databases or information about the utilization of transport services which can be used to improve public transport or for traffic jam forecasts. Thus, our construct consists of three items asking if the user would share information in general, if there is a benefit for the user or if there is a benefit for the online company. As a consequence, we decided to not include the contextual variable \"type of information\" since we could not cover all kind of information types and develop corresponding scenarios for them.\n\n\nMethodology\n\nThis section includes an assessment of whether our sample is representative for the Japanese population. Afterwards, we discuss the structural equation modelling approach for the analysis of the IUIPC model. In order to check for computation and implementation consistency, two software solutions were used: SmartPLS version 3 (Ringle, Wende, & Becker, 2015), as well as the package semPLS (Monecke and Leisch, 2012) in R (R Core Team, 2017).\n\n\nSampling Method and Sample Demographics\n\nWe conducted the online survey in 2015 with the help of the market research institute \"Macromill Group\" 3 , which contained -amongst other items -the items used by Malhotra et al. (2004). The 9,287 respondents were selected with no bias towards location, marital status, or number of children. In contrast, Malhotra et al. (2004) \"collected a total of 449 usable questionnaires from household respondents in one-on-one, faceto-face interviews\". Our decision for an online survey was motivated by the idea to get a larger sample along with the consideration that nowadays data sharing is mainly done online with computers or smartphones. One of the main drawbacks of online surveys is that one can only reach those who are online (cf. Hoogendorn and Daalmans, 2009). On the other hand, because of the interviewer's presence respondents in face-to-face interviews are more susceptible to social desirability (Duffy et al., 2005). Given the sample demographics, studies from Duffy et al. (2005) suggest that online surveys attract a more knowledgeable, viewpoint-orientated sample and Szolnoki and Hoffmann (2013) and Hoogendorn and Daalmans (2009) find that online surveys attract respondents with better education and a higher income than face-to-face 6 Re-Evaluating Internet Users' Information Privacy Concerns: The Case in Japan Volume 6 Paper 18\n\nsurveys. Summing up, our main goal was to achieve a large sample size. Since we could accept the discussed limitations, we decided to make use of an online survey.\n\nThe Japanese participants were balanced in terms of gender, with 50.53% males. With respect to the Japanese population, Statista identifies Japanese internet users to be 52.1% male (Ofcom, 2015). Due to the small difference, our sample can be considered as representative with respect to gender for the Japanese population. 54% of the respondents in the original study by Malhotra et al. (2004) were male. Figure 2 shows an age comparison between our sample and the Statista numbers (Ofcom, 2015) of Japanese internet users, to allow a comparison of the representativeness of our sample. The only remarkable age differences are observed for users aged between 15 and 24, and between 45 and 54.\n\nThe median of the yearly personal income is between 2 and 4 million Yen (approximately between 16,500 and 33,000 Euro) in our survey, with an inter-quartile range of 2 to 3 million Yen. In an income study (Nensyu Labo, 2014), the median personal income in Japan was around 3 million Yen, while the interquartile range was also of about 3 million Yen. Thus, our sample exhibits no issues of representativeness with respect to income. Malhotra et al. (2004) observed \"a median income of $60.000\" in their sample. With respect to education, 49.5% of the Japanese people aged between 25 and 64 hold a Bachelor's degree (OECD, 2016), while in our sample 35.7% of the respondents in the same age group have the same education level. In total, 41.96% of our respondents hold at least a Bachelor's degree. 71% of the sample of Malhotra et al. (2004) held at least a bachelor's degree. \n\n\nMeasurement Model\n\nA required step in the analysis of any structural equation model is analyzing the measurement (outer) model. In this step, the constructs are evaluated for reliability and validity conditions. Since all the constructs are measured reflectively, the reliability must be assessed via internal consistency reliability and indicator reliability tests. Additionally, validity criteria are fulfilled if convergent validity and discriminant validity are exhibited (Hair, Ringle, & Sarstedt, 2011). Malhotra et al. (2004, p. 341) assume a second-order structure for IUIPC. Therefore, we estimated this construct by using the repeated indicators approach (Wilson and Henseler, 2007). That means, the observable variables (i.e. questionnaire items) as indicators of the first order constructs are used as indicators of the second order construct IUIPC. One modification that we brought to the model of Malhotra et al. (2004) is that we used a self-developed construct, willingness to share, as a dependent variable. This construct was designed to measure the extent to which internet users are willing to share their personal information (as a behavioral intention). The specific items we used for our construct, willingness to share, as well as the items developed by Malhotra et al. (2004), which we used verbatim, are given in the Appendix.\n\n\nStructural Model\n\nThe model following Malhotra et al. (2004) is used; the target is to examine whether there are any differences between the USArepresented in the original study by Malhotra et al. (2004) and Japan with respect to the IUIPC construct and its relationship with the willingness to share construct (Hypotheses 1 to 5). As a conceptual replication, we did not include the contextual variable \"type of information\" (cf. Section 2.2). The results, reported in the section below, are obtained via structural equation modelling in SmartPLS 3.2.6 (Ringle et al., 2015). Non-parametric bootstrapping with 5,000 subsamples is used to test the significance of the obtained path coefficients. Additionally, we investigated demographic factors' influence on the IUIPC score. Specifically, we used a t-test for the gender effects, and Spearman rank-order correlation for the age, education, and income covariates. These tests were implemented using R (R Core Team, 2017).\n\n\nResults\n\nWe found no computational differences for the results of the model between the two software platforms, SmartPLS and R. Therefore, we do not further distinguish between them in the following report.\n\n\nMeasurement Model\n\nAs a preliminary step before assessing the overall path models, reliability and validity are evaluated. Internal consistency reliability, or the property of a group of items measuring the same underlying concept, is analyzed via the composite reliability and Cronbach's Alpha. The values of both measures should be between 0.7 and 0.95 for research that builds upon accepted models. Values of Cronbach's \u03b1 are seen as a lower bound and values of the composite reliability as an upper bound of the assessment. The values for both measures are within this range for all constructs, including the construct we developed, willingness to share (cf. Table 2). Analyzing the indicator reliability is related to understanding the extent to which a questionnaire item aids in predicting the variance of a certain construct. As we are undertaking a confirmatory study, we considered all items with a loading above 0.7 at a 95% significance level to be reliable. The only item with a loading below this threshold was Item 5 of the risk beliefs construct with a loading of -0.487. Hence, we decided to drop this item from the risk beliefs construct. The items we chose for our construct were acceptable with regard to their loadings and cross loadings ( Table 3). One of the measures for validity that we check for is the average variance extracted (AVE), which measures convergent validity. This type of validity verifies whether the items chosen for one construct are, in fact, measuring the related construct. AVE values higher than 0.5 apply to all the constructs used, thus the constructs are valid, including the construct willingness to share (AVE equals to 0.752). The AVE values of the other constructs are shown in Table 2.\n\nDiscriminant validity ensures that there is no expression overlap between the constructs, and that they measure different phenomena. One tool for this measure is the cross-loading matrix, showing whether the used items are adequate for measuring only the construct they were assigned to. Specifically, this would ideally translate to high item loadings for the target construct, as well as low ones for the other constructs.\n\nOur results do not indicate that the items developed by Malhotra et al. (2004) have a higher loading for other constructs, apart from Item 5 of risk beliefs which we removed. This particular item has a loading with a higher magnitude for trusting beliefs. With regard to our own construct, willingness to share, discriminant validity is also given, as the items would not be adequate for any of the other constructs (see Table 3). Another method for assessing discriminant validity is the Fornell-Larcker criterion (Fornell and Larcker, 1981). This criterion indicates that discriminant validity is achieved when the square root of the AVE is larger than the maximum of the correlation between the considered construct and any other construct in the model. All constructs pass this discriminant validity test (cf.    \n\n\nStructural Model and Hypothesis Testing\n\nBefore assessing the results of the structural model, collinearity must be checked. Collinearity is present if two predictor variables are highly correlated with each other. To address this issue, we assess the inner variance inflation factor (inner VIF). All VIF values above 5 indicate that collinearity between constructs is present. For our model, the highest VIF is 1.002. Thus, collinearity is apparently not an issue.\n\nThe IUIPC construct yields large and statistically significant effects on collection, control and awareness (   Figure 3). The values are comparable to those obtained by Malhotra et al. (2004) for the USA sample. Our conclusion is that the IUIPC construct is also applicable in Japan for all of its three domains. However, our results differ in contrast to those obtained by Malhotra et al. (2004) with respect to Hypothesis 1. Specifically, despite a statistical significance, the impact of the IUIPC construct on trusting beliefs is negligible, with a coefficient value of -0.031. These results indicate that this relationship is not relevant for the case of Japan. The relationship between IUIPC and the risk beliefs (Hypothesis 2) is positive and significant as in the original paper by Malhotra et al. (2004). However, the effect size for our Japanese sample is large (0.496), while the effect has only a medium size in the USA (0.26) (Malhotra et al., 2004). Testing Hypothesis 3pertaining to the relationship between trusting beliefs and risk beliefsyields different results from those obtained in the USA. Despite the fact that the trust beliefs have a statistically significant impact on risk beliefs, the impact is small enough to be negligible. Our results with respect to Hypothesis 4 indicate a similarity between Japan and the USA. Specifically, our results are in line with those obtained by Malhotra et al. (2004) with a statistically significant positive medium-sized effect of trusting beliefs on the willingness to share and behavioral intention, respectively (0.36 and 0.23). Analyzing the impact of the risk beliefs on the willingness to share (Hypothesis 5) yields results decidedly different from the original paper (Malhotra et al. 2004). Namely, the effect, while significant and negative, is only medium in size in Japan (-0.157) compared to the large effect observed in the USA. A summary of the hypotheses can be found in Table 4.\n\nRe-Evaluating Internet Users' Information Privacy Concerns: The Case in Japan Volume 6 Paper 18 With respect to fitting the data, this model yields an R 2 value of 0.16 for willingness to share. The trusting beliefs and risk beliefs have R 2 levels lower than those indicated by Malhotra et al. (2004). The lower R 2 levels provide a further indication that the Japanese users express their privacy concerns via different channels compared to their USA counterparts. In terms of model fit, the Normed Fit Index (Bentler & Bonett, 1980) has a value of 0.505 within the possible interval [0\u20261], where 1 applies to the perfect fit. The Standardized Root Mean Square Residual, which also takes values in the interval [0\u20261], with 0 being the best, has a value of 0.085. Other model fit measures, reported by Malhotra et al. (2004), are \u03c7 2 , the comparative fit index (CFI), goodness of fit index (GFI), root mean square error of approximation (RMSEA), and the consistent Akaike information criterion (CAIC). We calculated the indices with the lavaan package in R (Rosseel, 2012) (Table 5). The f 2 effect size measures the impact of a construct on the endogenous variable by omitting it from the analysis and assessing the resulting change in the R 2 value. The values are assessed based on thresholds by Cohen (1988), who defines effects as small, medium and large for values of 0.02, 0.15 and 0.35, respectively. Table 6 shows the results of the f 2 evaluation. The results correspond to those of the previous analysis of the path coefficients, with TRST having a medium-sized effect on WTS and RSK having only a small effect on WTS.\n\nThe final step of the structural model assessment is the evaluation of the predictive relevance Q 2 and the associated effect sizes q 2 . The Q 2 measure indicates the out-of-sample predictive relevance of the structural model with regard to the endogenous latent variables based on a blindfolding procedure. We used an omission distance of d=7. Recommended values for d are between five and ten (Hair, Ringle, & Sarstedt, 2011). Furthermore, we report the Q 2 values of the cross-validated redundancy approach, since this approach is based on both the results of the measurement model as well as of the structural model. For further information see Chin (1998). For our model, Q 2 is calculated for WTS. Values above 0 indicate that the model has the property of predictive relevance. In our case, the Q 2 value is equal to 0.114. Since it is larger than zero, predictive relevance of the model is established.\n\nVolume 6 Paper 18\n\nThe assessment of q 2 (see Table 6) follows the same logic as the one of f 2 . It is based on the Q 2 values of the endogenous variables and calculates the individual predictive power of the exogenous variables by omitting them and comparing the change in Q 2 . The effect sizes have to be calculated with the following formula (Hair, Hult, Ringle, & Sarstedt, 2017):\n\u2192 2 = 2 \u2212 2 1 \u2212 2\nAll individual values for q 2 are calculated with an omission distance d of seven. The thresholds for the f 2 interpretation can be applied here, too. The results correspond to the previous results. Trusting beliefs have a strong predictive relevance for the willingness to share, whereas risk beliefs have only a small to mediumsized predictive relevance.\n\nOur replication of the analysis by Zukowski and Brown (2007), regarding covariate effects, only confirmed the effects of gender on the privacy concerns in Japan. This finding is also reported by Tschersich et al. (2016). Specifically, a t-test for the gender shows a statistically significant difference in privacy concern levels of men and women. Specifically, women are found to be, on average, more concerned with respect to their privacy. Different from our study, Zukowski and Brown (2007, p. 201) do not observe this statistically significant gender difference.\n\n\nDiscussion and Conclusions\n\nIn this section, we present a brief discussion of the results, limitations to our study as well as a conclusion with implications for future work.\n\nInterestingly, the effect of IUIPC on trusting beliefs is quite weak (Hypothesis 1). The other studies draw an inhomogeneous picture. Sipior et al. (2013) could not confirm a relationship between IUIPC and trusting beliefs (as well as risk beliefs). Okazaki et al. (2009Okazaki et al. ( , 2012 find this connection, but in the latter paper nothing depends on trust and in the earlier paper the relation between trust and the behavioral intention is not significant (2009). Yang and Miao (2008) also observed this relationship but they did not consider risk beliefs. Pape (2018, 2019) found a relationship between IUIPC and trust beliefs in the case of PETs. In summary, it is not clear where this relatively small effect stems from and further research might be needed to investigate the trust concept in more depth. One possible explanation is that this is a consequence from broadening the scope, since we were not specific about the information type and the scenario (e.g. users could consider e-commerce, but others could also consider social media sites). In particular, Branzei et al. (2007) found that collectivists and individualists have distinct ways of building trust.\n\nCollectivists tend to rely more on situational signs than individualists who rely more on dispositional signs. Since users might have different trust levels towards different kinds of service providers, this could also weaken the connection in the model. However, since the relationship between IUIPC and trust beliefs could be observed in studies in other Asian countries, it is unlikely that it can be only attributed to cultural effects such as collectivism. Nevertheless, since none of the three other studies is an exact replication, this cannot be completely ruled out.\n\nConsidering the larger effect of IUIPC on risk beliefs (Hypothesis 2) as well as the lower effect of risk beliefs on the willingness to share (Hypothesis 5) compared to the original study, this means that even with an increase in risk beliefs, users still tend to share more information. Several possible explanations come to mind. This could be explained by the effects of collectivism where individuals have some risk beliefs but those stay mostly unconsidered when they share information (cf. Chow et al., 1999). On the other hand, we conducted the study more than 10 years later, thus it is also possible that the behavior of the population changed over time. Privacy concerns are not a static concept, they may change over time and they also may depend on the environment. While individuals might be more concerned, it could also happen that they become more insensitive due to daily media coverage or that they simply accept the loss of privacy associated with using online services (Hargittai and Marwick, 2016). An indication of this might be that the explanatory power of IUIPC was far lower than in the original paper by Malhotra et al. (2004) (cf. the R 2 values).\n\nInterestingly, we found only a negligible effect (-0.03) of trusting beliefs on risk beliefs (Hypothesis 3) whereas the original study from Malhotra et al. (2004) indicated a small effect (-0.15). The only studies from Japan conducted by Okazaki et al. (2009Okazaki et al. ( , 2012  Paper 18\n\nMalhotra et al. but adapted a construct from Schlosser et al. (2006) instead, which referred to trust towards mobile advertisers. Therefore, the results cannot be compared directly. Yang and Miao (2008) conducted a study with IUIPC in China, but did not consider risk beliefs. In 2013, Sipior et al. aimed to reassess the IUIPC construct and could confirm the effect. They also had a small sample size from the USA and used a regression model, thus the effect size is not directly comparable. In three studies with international users of privacy enhancing technologies, Harborth and Pape (2018, 2019, 2020 found medium effect sizes (-0.33, -0.30, -0.27). Further literature with other constructs suggests that trust can reduce the perception of risk (cf. McCole et al., 2010;Jarvenpaa et al., 2000). However, Mayer et al (1995, p. 711) state that no consensus on the relationship of risk with trust exists: \"It is unclear whether risk is an antecedent to trust, is trust, or is an outcome of trust.\" This still seems to be the case nowadays. Therefore, further research is needed to investigate if the negligible effect is spurious, can be based on cultural aspects, or depends on variables not considered within our model.\n\nThe effect of trusting beliefs on the willingness to share (Hypothesis 4) is larger than in the original study. This fits to the effects of collectivism described in the discussion of Hypotheses 2 and 5 where individuals have some risk beliefs but those stay mostly unconsidered when they share information (cf. Chow et al., 1999). As a consequence, the relationship with trusting beliefs could gain importance for the willingness to share information. However, we can still not rule out that it is rather a result of a behavior change over time than a cultural influence.\n\nConsidering privacy concerns, the willingness to share information and trust and risk beliefs, one can assume that all of those change over time. Devices change, are ubiquitously integrated into the environment and one can suspect that people might get used to the devices as well as to sharing their data and therefore become less sensitive towards potential risks of sharing information. On the other hand, a rising number of data breaches (cf. Clement, 2019) and reports about them within the mainstream media could have an opposite effect of increasing concerns and risk beliefs and therefore lead to a decreased willingness to share data. While the necessity of longitudinal studies on privacy concerns (Keith et al., 2014) has already been recognized, most studies only cover a considerably short period (Boyd, 2011;Keith et al., 2014;ARF, 2019). The longest period, 5 years, was covered by Tsay-Vogel et al. (2018) who investigated Facebook users. They observe a more relaxed privacy attitude in general but an increased risk perception by heavy Facebook users. However, their user group was very specific and all participants were between 18 and 25 with 28% males. Thus, we are far from results which can be generalized. In summary, there is still the need of longitudinal studies, which is most likely the consequence of the difficulty to collect longitudinal information disclosure data.\n\nEven though the correlation of IUIPC with age is significant, we consider it negligible in magnitude (0.113). Zukowski and Brown again obtain a different result from what we observed in Japan by accepting their hypothesis of an effect of age. Similarly, our correlation of IUIPC with the education and personal income levels yields negligible values of 0.03, and -0.05 respectively. Zukowski and Brown, however, do identify an effect of education, but also reject the effect of income.\n\n\nLimitations and Threats to Validity\n\nDespite the fact that our study benefits from a very large sample, the survey was conducted online compared to the face-to-face approach by Malhotra et al. (2004). Szolnoki and Hoffmann (2013) claim that face-toface surveys deliver representative samples with the caveat that they tend to underrepresent individuals with university degrees. In contrast to this, better educated people with higher incomes tend to be overrepresented in online studies (cf. Szolnoki and Hoffmann, 2013;Hoogendorn and Daalmans, 2009). However, this bias does not seem to be an issue for our analysis (cf. Section 3.1).\n\nAccording to Zukowski and Brown (2007) age as well as education have an effect on IUIPC, while gender, income level, and the internet experience do not. Even though the study of Zukowski and Brown (2007) was conducted in South Africa and we do not know whether their results can be transferred to Japan and/or the USA, we would have liked to compare the age distribution and the distribution of the education level to the distribution of the original study by Malhotra et al. (2004). Unfortunately, Malhotra et al. (2004) only provide the average age of their respondents (35 years), but did not provide any age distribution. As discussed in Section 3.1, our sample was not a perfect match to Japanese Internet users but had only a slight difference in the sample age distribution. Considering the education level, our sample was slightly below the education level of the entire Japanese population (no education level of Japanese Internet users was available) and considerably below the education level of the original study by Malhotra et al. (2004). Thus, effects from differences in the samples regarding age and education level cannot completely be ruled out. Another limitation is that we adapted the behavioral intention from \"intention to give/reveal information\" to willingness to share and did not include the \"type of information\". Since we were aiming for a more general scenario, the rationale why a user might share his or her information might be different from that in the original model.\n\nIn addition, we had to remove one item of the risk beliefs construct (IUIPC_RSK_05) since its loading was not above 0.7 at a 95% significance and it showed a higher loading for trust beliefs. However, given that this is a reverse scored item and the wording sounds already similar to the items of trust beliefs this is not too surprising. It may also be that the translation process made this issue worse. However, in none of the other studies we could find a report about this behavior.\n\n\nConclusion and Implications for Future Work\n\nThe main aim of the present study was to verify the applicability of the IUIPC model of Malhotra et al. (2004) in Japan, especially focusing on the comparison to the original USA sample as well as on changes due to differences in time when conducting the studies (difference of eleven years). Our results indicate that the IUIPC construct with its components awareness, collection and control is valid and reliable when applied within a Japanese sample. Its relationship to the behavioral intention construct (in our case willingness to share) is nonetheless not as clear as in the original paper about the USA. We observe that the connection between IUIPC and trusting beliefs is almost non-existent, in comparison to the medium-sized effect observed by Malhotra et al. (2004). Sipior et al. (2013) also observe no such relationship, but since their sample is relatively small and they do not use structural equation modelling, more research is needed in both Japan and the USA. Additionally, trusting beliefs has almost no impact on risk beliefs for our Japanese sample which was not the case in the USA.\n\nThe results of our first model confirmed our hypothesis that the Japanese privacy situation is different from that of the USA, as seen in the low R 2 of the dependent variable, willingness to share. The insight is that the standard IUIPC model is not sufficient to explain how the concerns of Japanese users affect their decision to share. The insights with respect to privacy concerns in Japan could be enhanced via studies analyzing the effect of other factors. For example, the existing literature indicates the potential of demographic aspects, cultural dimensions, situational cues etc. The influence of negative legal events could also be quantified as a construct in an extended model. Furthermore, the study at hand could be replicated in other countries to provide deeper insights with respect to cultural differences.\n\nThe implications of a better understanding of the factors and relationships of IUIPC can potentially enhance the protection of individual privacy. Additionally, it could facilitate the tailoring of public or corporate policies, trade agreements, international standardization, and the harmonization of laws for the online environment.\n\nFigure 1 .\n1Figure 1.\n\nFigure 1 .\n1IUIPC Results of Malhotra et al. (2004).* p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01, *** p < 0.001\n\n\nSpecifically, Malhotra et al. observe significant relationships, while Sipior et al. do not. However, since Sipior et al. do not use structural equation modelling and have a significant smaller sample, we adopt the hypotheses of Malhotra et al. (2004, pp. 341-342): Hypothesis 1: IUIPC will have a negative effect on trusting beliefs. Hypothesis 2: IUIPC will have a positive effect on risk beliefs. Hypothesis 3: Trusting beliefs will have a negative effect on risk beliefs. Hypothesis 4: Trusting beliefs will have a positive effect on the willingness to share.\n\nFigure 2 .\n2Age comparison between samples of Japanese internet users.

No current research was found to replicate the IUIPC model in a general context in Eastern societies. Furthermore, all of the studies deviate from the original model. Thus the need for a more recent replication is given.4 \n\nRe-Evaluating Internet Users' Information Privacy Concerns: The Case in Japan \n\n\n\nTable 2 ).\n28 \n\nRe-Evaluating Internet Users' Information Privacy Concerns: The Case in Japan \n\n\n\nTable 2\n2Reliability and validity measures.Mean \nSD \nAVE \nAWR \nCOLL \nCTRL \nIUIPC \nRSK \nTRST \nWTS \n\nAWR \n14.20 \n3.35 \n0.842 \n0.918 \n\nCOLL \n16.77 \n3.87 \n0.749 \n0.646 \n0.865 \n\nCTRL \n11.52 \n2.43 \n0.705 \n0.680 \n0.513 \n0.840 \n\nIUIPC \n0.00 \n1.00 \n1.000 \n0.901 \n0.865 \n0.811 \n1.000 \n\nRSK \n15.38 \n3.51 \n0.756 \n0.390 \n0.535 \n0.327 \n0.497 \n0.870 \n\nTRST \n16.37 \n4.36 \n0.731 \n-0.028 \n-0.101 \n0.081 \n-0.031 \n-0.050 \n0.855 \n\nWTS \n8.76 \n3.00 \n0.752 \n-0.193 \n-0.270 \n-0.074 \n-0.221 \n-0.175 \n0.368 \n0.867 \n\nSD = Standard Deviation \nAVE = Average Variance Extracted \nAWR = Awareness \nCOLL = Collection \nCTRL = Control \nIUIPC = Internet Users Information Privacy Concern \nRSK = Risk Beliefs \nTRST = Trusting Beliefs \nWTS = Willingness to Share \nThe second part of the matrix is used for the Fornell-Larcker criterion: the bold values represent the square root of \nAVE, while the values under the main diagonal represent construct cross-correlations. \n\n\n\nTable 3 .\n3Loadings and cross loadings for the items of the constructsItems / Constructs \nAWR \nCOLL \nCTRL \nIUIPC \nRSK \nTRST \nWTS \n\nAWR_01 \n0.924 \n0.575 \n0.626 \n0.823 \n0.352 \n-0.035 \n-0.170 \n\nAWR_02 \n0.924 \n0.567 \n0.634 \n0.821 \n0.347 \n-0.023 \n-0.159 \n\nAWR_03 \n0.905 \n0.635 \n0.613 \n0.837 \n0.373 \n-0.019 \n-0.203 \n\nCOLL_01 \n0.470 \n0.820 \n0.377 \n0.672 \n0.459 \n-0.114 \n-0.252 \n\nCOLL_02 \n0.630 \n0.863 \n0.505 \n0.796 \n0.421 \n-0.053 \n-0.206 \n\nCOLL_03 \n0.599 \n0.910 \n0.459 \n0.789 \n0.477 \n-0.105 \n-0.257 \n\nCOLL_04 \n0.522 \n0.867 \n0.423 \n0.728 \n0.499 \n-0.080 \n-0.225 \n\nCTRL_01 \n0.448 \n0.322 \n0.802 \n0.572 \n0.208 \n0.151 \n0.017 \n\nCTRL_02 \n0.578 \n0.436 \n0.875 \n0.698 \n0.284 \n0.087 \n-0.054 \n\nCTRL_03 \n0.661 \n0.510 \n0.840 \n0.753 \n0.318 \n-0.012 \n-0.130 \n\nIUIPC \n0.901 \n0.865 \n0.811 \n1.000 \n0.497 \n-0.031 \n-0.221 \n\nRSK_01 \n0.328 \n0.446 \n0.281 \n0.418 \n0.841 \n-0.046 \n-0.147 \n\nRSK_02 \n0.252 \n0.408 \n0.227 \n0.354 \n0.852 \n0.003 \n-0.109 \n\nRSK_03 \n0.341 \n0.500 \n0.285 \n0.449 \n0.908 \n-0.057 \n-0.168 \n\nRSK_04 \n0.410 \n0.492 \n0.329 \n0.487 \n0.876 \n-0.061 \n-0.172 \n\nTRST_01 \n-0.039 \n-0.134 \n0.059 \n-0.057 \n-0.083 \n0.854 \n0.336 \n\nTRST_02 \n0.052 \n-0.048 \n0.130 \n0.040 \n-0.050 \n0.881 \n0.297 \n\nTRST_03 \n0.012 \n-0.071 \n0.096 \n0.003 \n-0.056 \n0.877 \n0.294 \n\nTRST_04 \n-0.043 \n-0.061 \n0.046 \n-0.031 \n0.022 \n0.796 \n0.301 \n\nTRST_05 \n-0.089 \n-0.106 \n0.026 \n-0.075 \n-0.039 \n0.863 \n0.338 \n\nWILL_BNF_COMP \n-0.252 \n-0.292 \n-0.122 \n-0.270 \n-0.173 \n0.349 \n0.909 \n\nWILL_BNF_ME \n0.007 \n-0.131 \n0.049 \n-0.041 \n-0.116 \n0.276 \n0.770 \n\nWILL_BNF_OTHER \n-0.223 \n-0.262 \n-0.096 \n-0.237 \n-0.159 \n0.328 \n0.915 \n\nCronbach's \u221d \n0.906 \n0.888 \n0.792 \n1.000 \n0.893 \n0.908 \n0.833 \n\nComposite Reliability \n0.941 \n0.923 \n0.877 \n1.000 \n0.925 \n0.931 \n0.901 \n\n\n\nTable 3 .\n3Loadings and cross loadings for the items of the constructsAWR = Awareness \nCOLL = Collection \nCTRL = Control \nIUIPC = Internet Users Information Privacy Concern \nRSK = Risk Beliefs \nTRST = Trusting Beliefs \nWTS = Willingness to Share \n\n\n\nTable 4\n4Hypothesis summaryHypothesis \n\n\nTable 5\n5Goodness of Fit indices with quality thresholds adapted from Malhotra et al.
