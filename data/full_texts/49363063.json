Discrepancy about the measurements of spin Hall angle and spin diffusion length for Pt and Pd\n\nIn fig. S1, we show a summary of published results of both the spin Hall angle and spin diffusion length , (A) for Pt and (B) for Pd. We can find that these values are scattered over 1 order of magnitude in both and even with the same technique and for the same material. For Pt, ranges from 1 to 10 nm and varies from 0.012 to 0.19. Similar situation is also found for Pd as is scattered from 2 to 15 nm and values of reported is in the range of 0.005 to 0.11 (11-15, 29, 37, 41-51).\n\n\nsection S2. Negligible contribution of spin rectification effect, self-spin pumping, and thermal effect\n\nIn a spin pumping induced ISHE experiment, the measured signal may contain spurious signals caused by the spin rectification effect, self-spin pumping and the thermal effect. These may influence the quantification of the spin-charge conversion. In the following, we show these effects either can be removed by our special designed geometry or are negligibly small in comparison with the spin pumping induced ISHE signals.\n\nWe would like to briefly mention our specially designed geometry. In this work, we use the z-direction rf field to excite the FMR of ferromagnetic layer with in-plane external field. This geometry, was first developed by us in 2012 (12), and is commented to be \"the best configuration to clarify the differences among the voltage signals of the ISHE and the rectification effects\" by Iguchi and Saitoh (52). In this geometry, the induction current is along the stripe long axis, which is also the direction that we used to measure our signal.  fig. S3) can reproduce the thickness dependent ISHE voltage, but failed to reproduce the thickness dependent at the small thickness region, especially for Co/Pt system.\n\nIn order to reach a reasonable fit of the thickness dependent of Co/Pt system, we have to choose an extreme large value of in the order of 17000, which is unphysical.\nSI r 1 b r \uf064 b r SN r \uf0a5 11 2 11 cosh( ) coth( )sinh( ) 1 3 1 3 (1 coth( ))cosh( ) ( coth( ) )sinh( ) 22 N SI SN sd eff N N SI SI SN sd sd SN t rr gG t t r rr r \uf064\uf064 \uf06c \uf064\uf064 \uf065 \uf06c \uf06c \uf065 \uf0a5 \uf0ad\uf0af \uf0ad\uf0af \uf0a5 \uf0a5 \uf02b \uf03d \uf02b \uf02b \uf02b G \uf0ad\uf0af 1 = N el sd \uf065 \uf074 \uf074 0.1 11 tanh 2 SP ISHE N SH sd SML sd eff N Vt R g R few \uf071\uf06c \uf06c \uf061\uf062 \uf0ad\uf0af \uf0e6\uf0f6 \uf03d \uf0e7\uf0f7 \uf0e8\uf0f8 1 \uf064 b r 2 0.1 m b rf \uf03d\uf057 2 0.75 m b rf \uf03d\uf057 eff g \uf0ad\uf0af eff g \uf0ad\uf0af 1 \uf065\n\nsection S4. Failure of the fitting with interface transparency model\n\nWe also analyzed the data with interface transparency model proposed by W. Zhang et al. (14). In their formalism, they used a parameter T describing the transparency of the Pt-ferromagnet\n\ninterface to the spin current, which plays a central role in determining the magnitude of SHA.\n\nTheir model relates T to the spin-mixing conductance through the relationship (Eq. 2 in Ref. (14) \n\n\nsection S5. Thickness-dependent resistivity among different systems\n\nWe measured both the resistivity of the FM layer and FM/NM bilayer. The resistivity of the NM layer is then calculated according to the shunting relationship. Figure S4A and fig. S4B shows the NM thickness dependent resistivity of Pt and Pd for various FM/NM bilayers, respectively. At a large thickness, the resistivity is almost a constant. At small thickness, the resistivity increases with decreasing film thickness due to the enhanced contribution of the surface scattering. We note that with NM layer growing on different FM layer, resistivity shows distinct difference. The experimental data (symbols) can be described by Fuchs-Sondheimer theory (lines) (59-61).\n\nAccordingly, we estimated the resistivity of Pt and Pd films for different FM/NM combinations.\n\nWith the obtained resistivity, we further calculated the mean free path according to the Somerfield theory (24) (11-15, 29, 37, 41-51 The inset is the zoomed for Pt (0~3 nm). Solid lines are the fittings Eq. (S1) & (S2). \n\n\n, as listed in table S2. The different resistivity of Pd found in different systems can be understood as follows. In general, the resistivity in ultra-thin films prepared by sputtering depends highly on the interface structure match between two materials, even though the interface contribution of the resistivity is deducted from the Fuch-Sondheimer model. The different interfaces likely affect the resistivity by the variations of the grain boundaries and the stress related scattering. In our case, Pd films are subsequently deposited on top of the FM layers that pre-deposited on GaAs(001) substrates. The lattice mismatch of Pd/CoFe is about 3.4% (JCPDS file 65-2867 and 44-1433), which is significantly smaller than those of Pd/Co (9.8%) (JCPDS file 15-0806) and Pd/Py (8.1%) (JCPDS file 38-0419). Thus, the film quality of Pd on CoFe can be much better than those on Co and Py, resulting a smaller resistivity.section S6. Calculation of the spin Hall angle of PdTo calculate the spin Hall conductivity of Pd, we first construct the face-centered cubic (fcc) crystal of Pd with the lattice constant of 3.89 \u00c5. The electronic structure of the crystalline Pd is calculated self-consistently based upon density functional theory, implemented with the minimal basis of tight-binding linear muffin-tin orbitals (62). The local density approximation is employed with the exchange-correlation functional parameterized by vonBarth and Hedin (63). To quantitatively calculate the spin Hall angle (SHA), we build a 55 \uf0b4 supercell along fcc(111)direction and introduce the frozen thermal lattice disorder into the supercell (64). Specifically, the Pd atoms are displaced from the equilibrium position randomly following a Gaussian distribution while the root-mean-square displacement is determined by populating the phonon modes of the Pd crystal at a given temperature (65). The phonons are calculated using density functional perturbation theory. Then the supercell with lattice disorder is connected to two semi-infinite perfectly crystalline Pd electrodes and a perturbative electrical current density is introduced from the left lead to the right one. The transverse spin current density as a response to the longitudinal electrical current density can be computed using the wave functions of the scattering states at theFermi level (34). Meanwhile the resistivity \uf072 (or conductivity \uf073\uf072 =1 can be calculated by varying the length of the disordered scattering region and performing a linear least squares fitting (65). The spin Hall angle can be determined by the ratio of the calculated spin Hall conductivity and the longitudinal conductivity, SH SH \uf071 \uf073 \uf073 = , as plotted in fig. S5 as a function of the temperature. The SHA of Pt is also shown for comparison. The SHA increases monotonically with temperature for both Pt and Pd. We have used three types of exchange-correlation functionals and essentially obtained nearly identical results for the SHA of Pd. In fig. S6, the SHA and spin Hall conductivity of Pd are shown as a function of the resistivity. The SHA exhibits a linear dependence on resistivity at the whole range of 0-40 \u03bc\u03a9 cm indicating that the spin Hall conductivity is nearly a constant. In the left axis, we explicitly plot SH very good agreement with the calculated intrinsic spin Hall conductivity using other methods from first-principles (66-68). It indicates that the intrinsic contribution to the spin Hall effect in Pd is dominant. On the other hand, all the calculated spin Hall conductivities and SHAs of Pd are significantly larger than the experimentally measured values. The difference can be attributed to the unsatisfactory description of the electronic structure of Pd in the density functional theory (68). fig. S1.

The red solid squares (Pd) and black solid circles (Pt) are computed using the exchange-correlation functional parameterized by von Barth and Hedin (63). The solid and empty triangles are obtained using other two types of exchange-correlation functionals, which are parameterized by Perdew and Zunger (69) and Vosko, Wilk, and Nusair (70), respectively. The SHA of Pt is plotted for comparison. fig. S6. Calculated spin Hall conductivity and spin Hall angle as a function of resistivity.

The numbers in the parentheses are the error margins.\n\n\nThus, both Hall effects induced spin rectification are zero. In addition, the AMR has an angular dependence of sin 2\uf071 , while ISHE is proportional to sin\uf071 , where \uf071 is the angle between magnetization and stripe. Therefore, at As reported in Ref.(53, 54), the FM layer itself may also generate a spin pumping voltage. The effect is called self-pumping effect and may influence the estimation of the spin Hall angle. To estimate this influence, we compared the voltage generated by the FM layer only and FM/NM bilayer. The results are shown infig. S2. It shows that the self-pumping effect in Py, Co and CoFe, only in the order of 0.1 mK since the sample resistance is around a few k\u03a9. Second, if the thermal effect is strong, one should observe the anomalous Nernst effect with the pure FM sample. This, however, is not observed, also seefig. S2. In addition, the temperature effect is expected to have thatRojas-S\u00e1nchez et al. used   cited from values measured by current-perpendicular-to-plane magnetoresistance detector. However, we found the experimental measured value was of great uncertainty, for Co/Pt, varies from 0.2-0.9 (57). Moreover, the experiment is performed at low temperature, 4.2 K, not room temperature. Hence, we only used the interface resistance from references as shown in table S1. For Py/Pt system, we fixed90 \n\n\uf071 \uf03d\uf0b0 and \n\n270 \n\n\uf071 \uf03d\uf0b0 \n\n, the AMR induced spin rectification is also zero, as confirmed experimentally by our another \n\ninvestigation (27). \n\nSH \n\n\uf071 \n\nsd \n\n\uf06c \n\nsd \n\n\uf06c \n\nSH \n\n\uf071 \n\nsd \n\n\uf06c \n\nSH \n\n\uf071 \n\nsd \n\n\uf06c \n\nSH \n\n\uf071 \n\nif it is present, is less than 10% of the spin pumping induced ISHE signal obtained in bilayer \n\nsystems. We note similar finding was also reported for Py/Pt case in Fig. 18d of Ref. (55). \n\nThe FMR may also create a heating effect on the sample. This may add an additional signal through \n\nthe anomalous Nernst effect and spin Seebeck effect. We found the heating effect is negligibly \n\nsmall in our case based on the following reasons. First, as shown in Fig. 2B, the resistance \n\ndifference is only a few m\u03a9 in between on and off the resonance condition. If we assumed the \n\nresistance change is caused by the variation of the temperature, the estimated temperature change is \n\nvery different frequency dependence with the spin pumping induced ISHE signal (52). Our \n\nmeasured frequency dependence, however, show a linear dependence with the frequency which is \n\nexactly as the predicted frequency dependence of the spin pumping induced ISHE signal. Thus, we \n\ncan conclude the thermal effect is negligible in our case. \n\nsection S3. Failure of the fitting with SML model \n\nRojas-S\u00e1nchez et al.
