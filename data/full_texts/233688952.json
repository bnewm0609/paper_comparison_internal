The tight coupling between the power grids and their cyber components including monitoring, communication, and computation elements, has introduced new opportunities for enhancing the security and reliability of these systems. However, it has also introduced new vulnerabilities.\n\nOne of the key functions that the cyber layer provides for smart grids is the real-time monitoring of the system's states, which is essential for the reliable and efficient operation of these systems. Owing to the distributed nature of smart grids and their complex dynamics, as well as the introduction of new distributed energy resources, electrical vehicles, and other smart devices, which cause stochastic variations in the generation and load, where states of smart grids are highly dynamic and stochastic. To address the challenge of monitoring the state of such dynamic and geographically distributed systems, a large number of monitoring sensors, such as Phasor Measurement Units (PMUs), are deployed in smart grids. Furthermore, in addition to model-based methods for power system state estimation [1,2], various data-driven methods [3,4] are proposed to analyse the large volume of the collected data from such sensors to provide the best estimate of the states of the system to the control systems as well as system operators.\n\nOwing to the importance of system monitoring in smart grids as critical infrastructures, various types of cyber-attacks have targeted this function through compromising various components of the system and tampering or obstructing the data from monitoring sensors. Such attacks can lead to errors in the estimated system state in the control system and potentially severe flaws in the control and operation of the system affecting the reliability and efficiency of the system. As such, identifying and locating such cyber-attack incidents are critical in enhancing the reliability and efficiency of smart grids. In addition to the cyber-attacks, physical anomalies also threaten the reliability of smart grids and require real-time detection and locating by state monitoring systems.\n\nThe current work utilizes the data streams from the PMUs, in the form of time-series to help with the state monitoring function for detecting and locating various cyber and physical stresses in smart grids in real time. Specifically, it is built on our previous work [5], to present a data-driven method based on the correlation among the states of the components for detecting and locating stresses. In our previous work [5], we observed that the correlations among the states of the components vary in time due to changes in the system, such as generation and load demand variations as well as cyber and physical stresses affecting the system. Particularly, we showed that different kinds of events in the power grid have certain signatures on the time series associated with the states of the system as well as on the correlation pattern among the states. We also discussed that the instantaneous correlation matrix can serve as a visualization tool that can guide operators for detecting and locating the stresses instantaneously. By presenting the instantaneous correlation matrix corresponding to the states of the grid as an image, in [5], we proposed an imageprocessing-based technique for detection and locating of anomalies in the system.\n\nIn this article, we extend the work in [5] to study the effects of multiple stresses on the instantaneous correlation matrix corresponding to the states of the grid. Furthermore, we improve the technique presented in [5] for detecting and locating the stresses in the system by introducing a classification technique that alleviates the challenge of characterizing detection thresholds in the image-processing-based technique. Specifically, the proposed technique exploits the features extracted from the instantaneous correlation matrix and trains a k-nearest neighbour (k-NN) classifier for the detection of the stresses. The locations of the stresses are also determined from the correlation patterns of the buses in real time. Once the model is trained with the historical data, real-time detection and locating require a small amount of past data to calculate the instantaneous correlation matrix. The technique is capable of detecting multiple cyber-attacks and single line tripping events in the smart grid with improved and promising detection and false-positive rates.\n\nThe organization of the rest of the paper is as follows: Section 2 reviews the existing literature related to the detection and locating of cyber-attacks and physical events in the power grid by different techniques. In Section 3, we have shown the reflection of different cyber and physical stresses on the time series associated with states of the power system. The section also illustrates a monitoring technique of the power grid by visualizing the continuous streaming of the instantaneous correlation matrix image. Section 4 discusses the proposed automated method for detecting and locating stresses in the smart grid. The details of the simulation and the results have been discussed in Section 5. The final section includes some prospective future works related to this paper and the concluding remarks.\n\n\n| RELATED WORK\n\nOver the past decades, a large body of work is focussed on detecting and locating cyber and physical stresses in power systems. Many such methods are data-driven techniques that exploit PMU or other types of historical data for developing models for detecting stresses. Some of such models use dimensionality reduction techniques to represent and analyse the large volume of data using lower-dimensional models [6][7][8][9]. For instance, Chen et al. [6] uses historical data for real-time prediction of onestep-ahead states. In this approach, if the error of prediction exceeds a certain threshold compared to the actual measurements then an anomaly is declared. In [7], a real-time anomaly detection method is proposed in which the lower-dimensional representation of the PMU data using feature selection. Then, the isolation forest (iForest) algorithm is used for the detection of anomalies. In [8], Cai et al. considered the PMU data stream as a multivariate time series. Then using the principal component analysis (PCA) a lower-dimensional representation of the time series are obtained and the T 2 and the Q statistics of the principal components are used as the features for detection. Finally, a k-NN method has been applied in real time to detect the stresses.\n\nMahapatra and Chaudhuri [9] also proposed a technique for the detection of the cyber-attacks in wide-area systems based on the PCA of the PMU data.\n\nNeural networks-based methods are also popular for detecting and locating stresses in smart grids. For instance, Basumallik et al. [10] proposed a convolutional neural network (CNN)-based detection and classification for detecting anomalies from the packet-PMU data. The PMU data from different PMUs at the phasor data concentrator (PDC) is considered as a multivariate time series. The cross-correlation matrices corresponding to different types of anomalies are taken as the features for the CNN classifier. Ganjkhani et al. [11] proposed a non-linear auto-regressive exogenous neural network (NARXNN) for the real-time detection of false data injection attacks in the smart grid. NARXNN is a robust recurrent neural network model that is specially designed for time series data. In this method, the high correlations among states are used for the one-step-ahead prediction of the states using measurement values along with the historical data. The false data is then detected by comparing the predicted state values and the original measurements.\n\nIn addition to the aforementioned works, some studies use data mining and Bayesian models. For instance, Pan et al. [12] introduced a data mining-based intrusion detection system for the detection and classification of normal operation, cyberattacks, and disturbances. The authors in this article used the common path mining technique on both of the synchrophasor data and the power system audit logs. Karimipour et al. [13] presented an unsupervised machine learning method for the detection of cyber-attack in smart grids in real time. Symbolic Dynamic Filtering (SDF) is used for the extraction of the features. The learning is based on a dynamic Bayesian network model.\n\nMoreover, some researchers have utilized the spatial and temporal correlation among the measurements throughout the power grid to detect stresses in the system. For instance, Li et al. in [14] proposed a real-time detection and locating technique for false data injection attacks in the smart grid. The authors used the hidden Markov model (HMM) to recover the temporal correlations in measurements that are applied to detect the anomalies. Vector auto-regression is used to capture the spatial correlation among the measurements to locate the attack. Shi [15] proposed a spatio-temporal correlation-based monitoring, and anomaly detection and locating for distribution networks.\n\nAmong the other methods for detecting anomalies, Kurt et al. [16] used a cumulative sum (CUSUM) based algorithm for the real-time detection of cyber-and hybrid-attacks in smart grids. Furthermore, Chu et al. [17] proposed a quadratic prediction-based algorithm for the detection of cyber-attacks and anomalies in which a three sample quadratic prediction algorithm (TSQPA) based filter predicts one sample from its previous three samples. The error between the predicted sample and the measured sample is used to detect the stress. This work shows that the technique performs quite accurately on the suddenly applied false data, but when a set of false measurements is inserted gradually in the system that is ramp-attacks, the technique sometimes fails.\n\nIn the current paper, we have also considered the timevarying states corresponding to the power grid buses as the multivariate time series. The time-varying states can be obtained from the PMU data or by the sequence of measurements from the supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) system. A k-NN classification method is applied while the features for the training are determined from the instantaneous correlation matrix corresponding to the states. Instead of taking each pixel of instantaneous correlation matrix image as features similar to [10], we extracted features to train the k-NN method for classification which is computationally efficient.\n\n\n| EFFECTS OF CYBER AND PHYSICAL STRESSES ON INSTANTANEOUS CORRELATIONS\n\nThe electrical attributes associated with the buses and the branches in power systems can be considered as the state variables that collectively define the state of the system. The voltage phasors (voltage magnitudes and angles) of the buses in power systems are examples of key attributes that can enable the specification of the state of the system and other system's attributes. Let us denote the set of all buses in the system by B with the cardinality of the set represented by |B| \u00bc N. The value of a specific electrical attribute associated with bus i \u2208 B at time instant t is denoted by x i (t). The N-dimensional vector x \u00f0t\u00de represents the values of the attribute of all the buses at time t.\n\nWe consider the voltage angles of the buses as the state variables of the system. The reason behind this is that based on rigorous simulation and numerical evaluations, it is observed that the effects of changes in the system (e.g. load variations and most of the other phenomena such as cyber and physical stresses) are reflected in the bus voltage angle values. For the rest of the paper, we will use x \u00f0t\u00de to represent the bus voltage angles at time t, otherwise stated.\n\n\n| Instantaneous correlation matrix\n\nIn power systems, the time series of bus voltage angles associated with the buses within certain vicinity (geographical or topological) have strong correlations. Figure 1a illustrates the average correlation among the bus voltage angles of the IEEE 118 [18] bus system throughout a day. Note that in this figure, the blue pair of horizontal and vertical lines correspond to the reference bus that has a voltage angle of 0 at all times. For better visualization of the average correlation matrix, the reference bus has been omitted in the analysis in the paper as can be seen in Figure 1b.\n\nBased on the average correlation matrix image in Figure 1b, it can be observed that the voltage angles of buses in a vicinity have strong correlations. However, due to continuous changes in the load of the buses and other dynamics of the system, the correlation among the bus voltage angles varies considerably from time to time. For this reason, we are interested in the instantaneous correlation among the bus voltage angles instead of the average correlation.\n\nThe instantaneous correlation matrix of the bus voltage angles at any time instant t is a N \ufffd N square matrix C(t) with element c ij (t) defined as: \nq ; i; j \u2208 B;\u00f01\u00de\nwhere t c is the length of the correlation window. Although the length of the correlation window affects the instantaneous correlation matrix, in this article this effect has not been studied and instead a constant t c is considered.\n\nIn addition to the changes in load variations in time, the instantaneous correlation matrix changes due to cyber and physical stresses. Specifically, for physical stresses, such as the tripping of a transmission line or generator, the topology and dynamics of the system change abruptly. As a result, the state variables of the grid change, and the changes will be reflected in the instantaneous correlation matrix, C(t). Similarly, in the case of the cyber-attacks, the obtained values for the state variables change, and thereby the instantaneous correlation matrix, C(t) undergoes an abrupt change. Our studies show that although the instantaneous correlation matrix, C(t) changes continuously in time due to the dynamics of the system and load variations as well as stresses, the pattern of the change is quite different in normal and abnormal situations. In general, changes due to stresses are more abrupt and localized than the changes due to the normal load variations throughout the day. We exploit this difference in the changing pattern of the instantaneous correlation matrix, C(t) for monitoring of the system, and detecting and locating cyber and physical stresses.\n\nIn the first step, we proposed that visualization of the instantaneous correlation matrix, C(t), as an image can enable real-time visualization of abnormal changes and detection of stresses. Specifically, any change corresponding to the cyber or physical stresses can be visually detected and located from the instantaneous correlation matrix image due to sharp lines appearing in the images (will be discussed in the following subsections). We will specifically discuss how different cyber and physical stresses can be reflected in the bus voltage angle time series and how they can be monitored visually with the help of the instantaneous correlation matrix image. Later in this article, we will analyse the instantaneous correlation matrix using a classification method to automatically detect the abnormalities in the system.\n\n\n| Visualizing cyber stresses using instantaneous correlation matrix image\n\nVarious types of cyber-attacks can threaten the security and reliability of smart grids and attackers are always on the hunt for new methods to hamper the security of the system [19][20][21][22]. We have considered three types of cyber-attacks including the Denial-of-Service (DoS) attack [23], Data-replay attack [23,24], and Ramp attack [17]. The DoS attack and Datareplay attacks are common types of attack in the cyber-physical systems. The ramp attack is a special type of data integrity attack in which the attacker introduces false measurements into the system gradually with time to deceive the system and operators. The detection of this type of attack is difficult because of the absence of sharp discontinuities at the onset of the attack. In this subsection, we present simple mathematical formulations of different cyber-attacks and illustrate their effects on the bus voltage angle time series. We will also show the visualization of their effects in the instantaneous correlation matrix image. For the purpose of defining cyber-attacks, let A \u2282 B be the set of buses under cyber-attack and S \u2282 B be the set of buses that the attackers have access to record data. Note that in practice, various constraints, such as technical, physical and limited resources, can affect the size and distribution of the sets A and S and in general the capabilities of attackers in launching the attacks. While such constraints can affect the spread and severity of the attacks and thereby impact the performance of detection and locating mechanisms, these aspects are not the focus of this article. Here, it is assumed that the attacker has the capability to launch single or multiple attacks on any of the buses of the system.\n\n\n| DoS attack\n\nWe model the DoS attack as the absence of measurements or unobservability of any of the state variables for a certain period of time (i.e. from the time instant t Start to the time instant t End the value of variables associated with attacked components are not sampled or communicated). Let, x i (t) be the actual time series of any state variable (i.e. any electrical attribute such as voltage phase angle) corresponding to the i-th bus and x DoS i \u00f0t\u00de is the time series corresponding to the state under DoS attack. We can model the DoS attack as follows:\nx DoS i \u00f0t\u00de \u00bc n i \u00f0t\u00de if t Start \u2264 t \u2264 t End x i \u00f0t\u00de \u00fe n i \u00f0t\u00de otherwise; \ufffd\u00f02\u00de\nwhere n i (t) is the Additive White Gaussian Noise signal associated with the i-th bus voltage angle measurement. Figure 2a illustrates the voltage angle time series associated the bus number 87 in the IEEE 118 system when there is a DoS attack at that bus within the time interval t Start = 5 to t End = 6. Figure 2b,c shows two consecutive frames of C(t), which appear just before the onset of the attack (i.e. at t = t Start \u2212 \u03f5, where \u03f5 is a small constant) and just after the onset of the attack (i.e. at t = t Start + \u03f5), respectively. By comparing these two consecutive frames of C(t), one can observe that a pair of horizontal and vertical lines corresponding to the attached bus (i.e. in this case bus 87) appear in the matrix image of C(t) after the attack.\n\n\n| Data replay attack\n\nThe data-replay attack or replay attack is a cyber-attack in which the attacker records the data-stream from some of the buses and inject them later in the data-stream of the same buses or other buses that they have compromised. Mathematically the data-replay can be expressed as follows:\nx Replay i \u00f0t\u00de \u00bc x k \u00f0t 0 \u00fe t \u2212 t Start \u00de \u00fe n i \u00f0t\u00de if t Start \u2264 t \u2264 t End x i \u00f0t\u00de \u00fe n i \u00f0t\u00de otherwise; \ufffd\u00f03\u00de\nwhere t Start and t End are the starting and ending of the replay attack, respectively, and t 0 is the starting of the recording time. Here, i \u2208 A and k \u2208 S. Figure 3a illustrates the voltage angle time series associated with the bus number 107 in the IEEE 118 system when there is a data-replay attack at that bus within the time interval t Start = 13 to t End = 14. Figure 3b,c shows two consecutive frames of C(t), which show just before the onset of the attack (i.e. at t = t Start \u2212 \u03f5, where \u03f5 is a small constant) and just after the onset of the attack (i.e. at t = t Start + \u03f5), respectively. A pair of horizontal and vertical lines corresponding to bus number 107 is visible when the attack occurred in the system. However, another pair of horizontal and vertical lines corresponding to bus number 80 is also visible in C(t Start \u2212 \u03f5). This is due to the dynamics of the system and load variations at bus number 80, which has resulted in a different correlation pattern with other buses. Prior knowledge of this type of behaviours can be helpful in eliminating false alarms in the system. In the automated method of detection that will be discussed in the next section, these kinds of situations are handled automatically by training the model using data from normal and abnormal states of the system.\n\n\n| Ramp attack\n\nRamp attack is a special type of false data injection attack in which the attacker gradually introduces bad data into the data stream. Any linear-prediction-based detector will fail to detect this type of attack due to its gradual change. In Figure 4a -311\nx Ramp i \u00f0t\u00de \u00bc x i \u00f0t Start \u00de \u00fe n i \u00f0t\u00de \u00fe m \ufffd \u00f0t \u2212 t Start \u00de; if t Start \u2264 t \u2264 t End x i \u00f0t\u00de \u00fe n i \u00f0t\u00de; otherwise; 8 < :\u00f04\u00de\nwhere m is the slope. Similar to the previous attacks, the ramp attack can be detected and located visually from two consecutive instantaneous correlation matrices as can be seen in Figure 4b,c. However, since in the ramp attack the value of the variable (i.e. voltage angel) in the compromised bus changes gradually, the effect of the stress may be noticeable after one or two sampling instances from the attack instance (i.e. it might be reflected on\nC(t Start + \u03f5 0 ) instead of C(t Start + \u03f5), where \u03f5 0 \u2265 \u03f5.\n\n| Multiple cyber-attacks\n\nThe examples shown in Figures 2-4 depicted the effects of single cyber-attacks in the system on the instantaneous correlation matrix. We can evaluate the effects of multiple attacks similarly. In Figure 5, the instantaneous correlation matrix of the system is shown after multiple attacks. Figure 5a presents the instantaneous correlation matrix of the system after multiple cyber-attacks launched on random buses throughout the grid. Figure 5b,c represents multiple cyber-attacks on the clustered buses (buses within certain vicinity) during normal and high fluctuation load variation periods, respectively. As can be observed from Figure 5c, when load variations in the system are high, detecting and locating attacks are more challenging.\n\n\n| Effects of physical stresses on instantaneous correlation matrix image\n\nPhysical stresses in power grids generally involve changes in the physical state of the components (e.g. functional state of the components, load on the components). Tripping of a transmission line or a generator or changes in the reactive power are some examples of physical stresses. In this article, the effects of tripping a single transmission line in the system on its state and the instantaneous correlation matrix will be studied. Physical stresses in power systems usually affect the state of the components that are within certain vicinity to the location of the incidence. The effects, in general, depend on various factors such as the structure and dynamics of the system. For example, Figure 6 illustrates the effect of tripping the transmission line between bus number 85 and 89 of the IEEE 118 bus system on the bus voltage angle signal of the nearby buses. We observe that the tripping affects bus voltage angle signals of bus number 85, 87, and 89. However, the bus voltage angle time series associated with the bus number 88 seems to be unaffected although this bus is also geographically adjacent to the tripped line.\n\nSimilar to the cyber-attacks, physical stresses can be visually detected from the instantaneous correlation matrix images, but since this kind of stresses affects voltage angle measurement of the nearby buses, the exact location of the stress is comparatively difficult to identify. Instead of a single pair of horizontal and vertical lines in the cyber-attack cases, a region with sharp variations is observed in the instantaneous correlation matrix images. For example, from the instantaneous correlation matrix image in Figure 7, it can be specified that the physical stress has occurred somewhere within buses indexed 68 to 75. The stress is in fact tripping of the line connecting bus number 75 and 77.\n\n\n| DETECTING AND LOCATING CYBER AND PHYSICAL STRESSES USING INSTANTANEOUS CORRELATIONS\n\nIn the previous section, we discussed the effects of stresses on the correlation pattern among the states of the components (i.e. the changes in the instantaneous correlation matrix) in the power system. In this section, we will use the instantaneous correlation matrix, C(t) which bears information about the cyber and physical stresses, to develop methods for detecting and locating the stresses in the system.\n\nIn our previous work [5], we developed a method for detecting and locating stresses from the instantaneous correlation matrix, C(t) for single stresses using image processing techniques. In the current paper, a new method has been introduced based on classification methods to enhance the previous technique by adding robustness against load variations and being able to detect multiple cyber-attacks. Specifically, the presented method in this article addresses the challenge of characterizing thresholds for the detection of stresses used in the previous method with a machine learningbased approach, which extracts features and classifies the data (as anomalous or normal) using k-NN method.  \n\n\n| Aggregated instantaneous correlation vectors\n\nThe proposed method in this article utilizes the information embedded in the instantaneous correlation matrix. As such, the first step of the proposed process would be to calculate the instantaneous correlation among the state of the components using the PMU time series. As discussed earlier, at each time instant, t we calculate C(t) from the values of the state variables using Equation (1). In the results presented in this article, we have considered the correlation window of width 30 s. In the previous section, we observed the effects of stresses and anomalies in the system by visualizing C(t) as an image. For designing analytics that can detect changes in the C(t), we need further processing of C(t). To this end, we calculate the aggregated correlation for each individual component with the rest of the components of the system at time t. Specifically, we denote the vector of all aggregated correlations by v \u00f0t\u00de defined as v \u00f0t\u00de \u00bc C\u00f0t\u00deu , where u \u00bc \u00bd1; 1; \u20261\ufffd T (i.e. the vector v \u00f0t\u00de is the column sum of the matrix C(t)). For instance, Figure 9a matrix C(t). As a result, if an attack occurs during a high load variation period then sharp changes in v \u00f0t\u00de due to the stress become difficult to distinguish from changes due to load variations. Although in practice, the load fluctuation scenarios are likely to be less abrupt than cyber and physical stresses and show smaller variations in the correlation, to make our detection method more robust to such scenarios, we consider the difference correlation matrix to capture the temporal change of the correlation patterns in the system. The difference correlation matrix is defined as C Diff (t) = C(t) \u223c C(t \u2212 T s ), which is the difference matrix between the instantaneous correlation matrix images at time, t and its previous sampling instant, t \u2212 T s .\n\n\nF I G U R E 7 Instantaneous correlation matrix corresponding to a single line tripping\n\n\nF I G U R E 8 Flow chart of stress detection at time instant t\n\n\n-\n\nSimilarly to the v \u00f0t\u00de, we also define the aggregated difference correlation v Diff \u00f0t\u00de \u00bc C Diff \u00f0t\u00deu . In this article, we consider C Diff (t) and v Diff \u00f0t\u00de along with C(t) and v \u00f0t\u00de for the detection of stresses.\n\n\n| Feature extraction and classification for stress detection\n\nIn the previous sections, wediscussed and showed that the vectors v \u00f0t\u00de and v Diff \u00f0t\u00de contain signatures and patterns of the effects of stresses in the system that can be used for detection. A simple and yet not very effective approach to detect the stresses using these vectors is to apply thresholds to identify sharp changes in the correlation of the components. However, due to the dynamics of the power system governed by the physics of electricity as well as the stochastic nature of loads and generations in the system, the state variables associated with some of the buses have high variance characteristics, which may lead to sharp changes in vectors v \u00f0t\u00de and v Diff Figure 11, in which there is a line failure at branch number 28 connecting bus number 21 and 22 in the IEEE 118 system. This phenomenon is detectable visually from C(t) and v \u00f0t\u00de but in v Diff \u00f0t\u00de we notice another anomaly-like region near bus number 70 and 80. Therefore, a simple threshold-based method would fail to distinguish normal versus abnormal variations in the correlation.\n\nFor this reason, instead of taking the decision directly from v \u00f0t\u00de or v Diff \u00f0t\u00de and using thresholds, we propose to extract a few important features from v \u00f0t\u00de and v Diff \u00f0t\u00de and apply a machine learning algorithm for classifying the normal and stressed (cyber-attack or line failure) cases. By training the model using samples of normal and abnormal conditions we will show that the false alarms due to normal conditions that cause variations in the correlation can be reduced significantly.\n\nThe features to be used by the classification method in this paper have been identified based on vectors v \u00f0t\u00de and v Diff \u00f0t\u00de as following. For v Diff \u00f0t\u00de, we consider:    To enhance the robustness of the detection method against dynamics, such as load variations, these features have been selected such that they capture multiple peaks' characteristics in v Diff \u00f0t\u00de. For instance, features F1 and F2 (i.e. the mean and the standard deviation of v Diff \u00f0t\u00de) are good overall indicators of existence of peaks due to the stresses. Specifically, peaks due to normal load changes are not usually significant and these first two features can describe the normal variations in the correlations and v Diff \u00f0t\u00de. On the other hand, features F3 and F4 capture the characteristics of large peaks in v Diff \u00f0t\u00de and to specify significant changes in variations. Features F5 and F6 will enable the model to recognize multiple cyber-attacks. Features F7 and F8 describe the number of peaks in v Diff \u00f0t\u00de. The exact definition of these features and their parameters, for instance, the number of the largest values to be considered are identified based on experiment and by trial and error. We use the same set of features mentioned above from vector |v \u00f0t\u00de| as well. Note that, although none of these features is a clear indicator of the stress separately, together they can characterize abnormal variations in the signal that is required for classification between normal and abnormal cases. These 16 features are utilized for the classification as discussed next.\n\nUsing the features extracted from vectors v \u00f0t\u00de and v Diff \u00f0t\u00de, we propose to apply (k-NN) method for the classification of normal and stress cases.\n\n\n| k-NN method for classification\n\nAfter extracting the features from the instantaneous correlation matrix by various signal processing techniques, we formulate the detection of a stress at time, t as a two-class classification problem. Let f \u00f0t\u00de be the feature vector and y(t) be the class label (i.e. y(t) \u2208 {Normal, Stressed}) associated with the instance t. According to the k-NN method, the probability of a stress at time t is calculated as [25]:\nPrfy\u00f0t\u00de \u00bc Stressedg \u00bc 1 k X i\u2208N k \u00f0f \u00f0t\u00de\u00de I\u00f0y\u00f0t\u00de \u00bc Stressed\u00de;\u00f05\u00de\nwhere N k \u00f0f \u00f0t\u00de\u00de is the set of all points in the k-nearest neighbourhood of the point f \u00f0t\u00de, (i.e. the set of k-points that have minimum Euclidean distance from the point f \u00f0t\u00de in the feature space) and I is the indicator function. In addition to k-NN, we have studied the performance of other classification methods, such as decision tree and have observed that in this problem k-NN outperforms other methods in terms of accuracy and computational time. In the presented method, the k-NN classifier is trained with normal and anomalous data generated using our simulations of normal and stresses scenarios as discussed in the Result Section. In its training step, k-NN stores the coordinates of the instances and their class label using the features space. In the test step, it decides the class of the instance, that is, normal or stressed, by computing its neighbourhood. The computational efficiency of the k-NN classifier makes it suitable for real-time applications such as monitoring the state.\n\n\n| Locating stresses in the system\n\nThe classification method using the introduced features will allow the detection of cyber-attacks and line failure stresses in the system. To determine the location of the stresses, we utilize the vector v Diff \u00f0t\u00de directly. We choose b \u00bc maxfv Dif f k \u00f0t\u00deg, that is, the peak location in this vector, to specify the location of the stress. Note that index b represents the bus index under cyber-attack or the bus index of the bus connected to a tripped line in case of physical failure.\n\n\n| Computational complexity\n\nThe complexity for computing the instantaneous correlation matrix, C(t) is O\u00f02n Corr \ufffd N\u00f0N\u00fe1\u00de  (n Train ). However, the complexity of the k-NN method can be reduced up to O(log(n Train )) [26]. In summary, the complexity of the proposed detecting and locating method is max{O(N 2 ), O(log(n Train ))}. For smaller grids, the computational load is dominated by the number of training samples whereas in large grids by the size of the grids. However, since in larger grids the computational complexity is higher, our method would be more effective with computation by grid partitioning or optimal placement of PMUs.\n\n\n| RESULTS\n\nIn this section, we discuss the details of the simulation, training of the classification model, and the performance of the presented methods for detection and locating of the stresses in power systems. The results are shown for the IEEE 118 bus system [18].\n\n\n| Generating state attribute time series\n\nThe power system simulations for the experiments are based on MATPOWER 6.0, a package of MATLAB M-files [27]. We have generated a simulated PMU time series using the steadystate power flow calculations using MATPOWER based on time-varying loads. The process of generating data is quasistatic in the sense that we did not use the dynamic models for the generators in the power system; instead, the dynamicity is associated with the load variations. The load patterns collected from the daily load data of the New York Independent System Operator (NYISO) [28] have been used to generate timevarying loads for this quasi-static simulation. There are 11 regions in NYISO and for each of the regions, we have the time-varying day-long load data. Since in IEEE 118 bus system we have 91 load buses, we synthetically create 11 3 \u00c0 \ufffd \u00bc 165 daylong load data by taking averages of the combinations of three load data similar to [29]. From these 165 load profiles, we consider the first 91 load data for the 91 load buses of the IEEE 118 bus system. The load profiles are then normalized within 0 to 1 and added to the default constant loads of the MATPOWER 118 bus case. The generations and the power factors are adjusted accordingly to ensure the convergence of the power flow solution for normal cases. The load data in the NYISO are recorded every 5 minutes. We interpolate this timeseries to increase the sampling rate to 0.33 samples/s. However, in this process, the sampling rate can be further increased depending on the computational resources. Single line failures are also simulated, and their effects are collected in the corresponding time series. Moreover, the effects of various cyberattacks are reflected in the time series using the models discussed in Section 3.\n\nFor the cyber-attacks, we have simulated 10,000 scenarios for the performance evaluation. Among these scenarios, some of them contain cyber-attacks of a certain kind and other scenarios do not contain any attack and are for the system under normal conditions. If the scenario contains an attack, then the type of the cyber-attack (i.e. DoS attack, data-replay attack, or the ramp attack) and the number of attacks are selected randomly. After that, the location of the attack is also selected randomly from all the buses with uniform probability. The time for the launching of the attack is also selected randomly among all possible time instants throughout the day with uniform probability. For the performance evaluation in case of a single line tripping, we create 1000 scenarios with tripping and notripping cases similar to the scenarios for cyber stresses. The lines to be tripped are selected randomly from the 186 branches of the IEEE 118 bus system with uniform probabilities.\n\n\n| Detection and locating performance\n\nIn our work, we have considered the voltage angles associated with buses as the state variables. We have calculated the instantaneous correlation matrix using Equation (1). The correlation window, t c is selected as 0.25 min.\n\nAs described in the previous section, we use k-NN classification and choose k = 5 to detect stresses in real time. Our simulation shows that the detection performance is not very sensitive to the values of k ( Figure 12). In fact, for physical stresses, the detection performance remains constant after k = 20. Randomly generated 10,000 instances in different locations and at different times throughout a day has been used in the training of the k-NN model by extracting features from the instances. The performance of the model is validated by 10-fold cross-validation.\n\nWe have studied the accuracy of the presented methods for cyber and physical stresses, separately. We apply the classification method to all 10,000 scenarios (scenarios with cyberattack or no attack) to determine if a cyber-attack has occurred in the system or not (if the scenario does not contain any attack, a random time instant is still selected at which our proposed method runs to detect whether there is an attack). The statistics of the performance of the method (i.e. True Positive Rate (TPR), False Positive Rate (FPR), and Exact  Table 1. The work by Shi et al. [15], which uses spatio-temporal correlation for detection shows a detection rate of 85% and a false-positive rate of 16.04%. Although the exact comparison of these methods is challenging due to the differences in detection parameters, test cases, measurement data, and stress models, these methods show comparable performances. Besides, our method can perform well for the ramp attack, which is a challenging detection problem [17]. Moreover, many existing works, including our previous work in [5], only focus on the detection rate for the performance evaluation of their proposed methods [14], while the false-positive rate is usually overlooked. One of the key advantages of our proposed method is achieving a good detection rate while keeping false positive rate low.\n\nIn the case of the physical line failure, we have applied the method to the 1000 scenarios with one line failure and no failures. In general, identifying the exact location of the line failure is more difficult compared to cyber stresses. As such, to evaluate the performance of the locating process, in addition to the exact location, we consider a two topology-hop vicinity of the failed line and calculate the rate of locating within this vicinity. The statistics of the performance of the method for physical failure is shown in Table 1 based on TPR, FPR, Exact Locating Rate, and Locating within 2\u2212Hop and 3\u2212Hop Distance Rate.\n\nThe k-NN method for classification is simple in implementation and robust to linearly non-separable classes. Moreover, k-NN facilitates easy insertion of new instances into the training set that enables updating the training instances regularly with the changing situations of the grids. This advantage makes the arrangement robust to the long-term grid dynamics. Our simulation shows that similar performance can be achieved by the decision tree method taking twice as much time as the k-NN method (Table 1).\n\n\n| CONCLUSIONS\n\nWe have considered the problem of monitoring the dynamic state of power systems using a data-driven approach applied to the multivariate time series of state variables at buses. We discussed that the instantaneous correlation matrix, which captures the correlation among the state of the components, bear important information about the dynamics and stresses in the system. We showed that visualizing the instantaneous correlation matrix image can provide a simple yet effective tool for detecting and locating stresses for the real-time monitoring of the power grid. We further developed a k-NN classification method using features extracted from the instantaneous correlation matrix to detect various types of cyber-attacks as well as the single-line failure in the system. The presented method shows a promising performance and sheds light on the importance of the correlation information among the state of components in the system. Prospective future works include detecting and locating joint cyber-physical attacks, classification among different types of stresses, and detecting multiple physical failures using the state correlations in real time.\n\n\nNOMENCLATURE Sets\n\n\nA\n\nSet of buses under cyber-attack.

In the following subsections, we have discussed the process of the detection and locating technique. The steps of the presented method have been illustrated using a flow-chart inFigure 8\n\n\n.\n\n\n,b illustrates C(t) and v \u00f0t\u00de after a single line trip. In this case, the branch number 165, which is a transmission line connecting bus 103 and 104 in the IEEE 118 system, has been tripped. The state variables (i.e. the voltage angle measurements) in the nearby buses has been changed drastically and the correlation of the state variables in this area with the other state variables decreased. This effect can easily be visualized from C(t) inFigure 9a. In addition, fromFigure 9b, we observe that the components of v \u00f0t\u00de in the vicinity of the tripped line are significantly lower than other components because the correlations among the other buses do not change significantly. However, depending on the load fluctuations and the location of the stresses, this effect may not be visually obvious all the time, nevertheless, v \u00f0t\u00de is a useful source of features for the automated detection and locating of the stresses. Large load variations in the power systems can result in large variations in the instantaneous correlation\n\n\n\u00f0t\u00de causing large false alarms. Moreover, in the case of multiple stresses and during load fluctuations, vectors v \u00f0t\u00de and v Diff \u00f0t\u00de may contain multiple sharp changes with different amplitudes. Examples of such scenarios are depicted in Figures 10 and 11. Specifically, Figure 10 represents a case in which there is no cyber or physical stresses. Nevertheless some of the components of v \u00f0t\u00de and v Diff \u00f0t\u00de seem to have large correlation variations compared to most of the component (they appear as peaks in v Diff \u00f0t\u00de and drops in v \u00f0t\u00de).

The complexity for computing the difference correlation matrix C Diff (t), aggregated correlation matrix, v \u00f0t\u00de, and aggregated differences correlation matrix, v Diff \u00f0t\u00de, are also O(N 2 ) since they involve accessing all the elements of C(t).
