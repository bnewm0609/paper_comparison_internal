However, much of the lit erature on this topic has addressed information pri vacy within the context of threats from traditional direct marketers (Phelps et al. 2000, Sheehan andHoy 2000). Unlike traditional direct marketing channels, the Internet allows for interactive two-way commu nication and accordingly poses unique information privacy threats that differ from the issues previously addressed (Hoffman and Novak 1996, Smith et al. 1996, Sheehan and Hoy 2000. For this reason, Phelps et al. (2000, p. 40) stated that \"research involving pri vacy and information issues related to e-commerce, however, remains primarily in a nascent stage\" and called for more studies.\n\nTo maximize the potential of e-commerce, it seems critical to accurately understand online consumers' concerns for information privacy. However, although several pioneering studies exist that examine online privacy in general (e.g., Mehta and Sivadas 1995; Miyazaki on three major dimensions-namely, collection, con trol, and awareness of privacy practices (Donaldson 1989, Donaldson and Dunfee 1994, Dunfee et al. 1999, Phelps et al. 2000. This article also argues that the proposed model, strongly rooted in the trust-risk framework (McKnight et al. 1998) and the reasoned action paradigm (Fishbein and Ajzen 1975), will serve as a useful tool for analyzing reactions of online con sumers to various privacy threats on the Internet.\n\n\nIUIPC\n\nThis section begins with the description of the notion of information privacy concerns and the review of existing scales designed to represent such concerns. and regulatory laws (Milberg et al. 1995, Culnan and Bies 2003, Andrews 2002. Information privacy concerns refer to an individual's subjective views of fairness within the context of information privacy (Campbell 1997 and Segars 2002, Smith et al. 1996, Campbell 1997.\n\nHowever, as Smith et al. (1996) (2000) found that a majority of respondents (85.6%) wanted to limit the amount of personal information collected by marketers. Cespedes and Smith (1993) argued that an idiosyncratic \"privacy threshold\" level existed for the amount of data people were willing to provide. Indeed, the collection factor constitutes one of the four CFIP dimensions1 (Smith et al. 1996).\n\nAccordingly, it seems reasonable to expect that mar keters' collection of personal information will con tinue to be an important source of privacy concerns among Internet users (Rendleman 2001). Thus, we posit collection, which is also a dimension of CFIP, as an important factor characterizing IUIPC.\n\n\n2.2.2.\n\nControl. SC theory is strongly rooted in the principle of procedural justice (Gilliland 1993, Thibaut and Walker 1975, Tyler 1994. According to the prin ciple of procedural justice, individuals view proce dures as fair when they are vested with control of the procedures (Thibaut andWalker 1975, Tyler 1994). In other words, consumers want to exercise process con trol and influence changes in organizational policies they find to be objectionable (Gilliland 1993, Thibaut andWalker 1975 1986, Greenberg 1990). Meanwhile, informational jus tice relates to the disclosure of specific information.\n\nPerceptions of fairness increased with the specificity of information used to provide justification (Shapiro et al. 1994).\n\nAccording to Hoffman et al. (1999), a majority of Web users (69%) refused to reveal personal infor mation to online firms because they were not sure how the data would be used. Similarly, Phelps et al. (2000) showed that about 50% of the respondents in their survey study were looking for more information  A general consensus in the trust-risk literature shows that personal traits influence, to some extent, trusting beliefs and risk beliefs (Mayer et al. 1995, McKnight et al. 1998). This implies that one's ten dency to worry over information privacy (i.e., IUIPC) will influence how the person perceives a specific situation in which an online marketer requests per sonal information (i.e., trusting and risk beliefs). More specifically, Internet users with a high degree of information privacy concerns are likely to be low on trusting beliefs and high on risk beliefs. This proposition is also consistent with TRA, which sug gests that individual characteristics influence salient beliefs (Fishbein and Ajzen 1975, Ajzen 1991. Thus, as depicted in Figure 1, we propose that IUIPC will influence trusting beliefs negatively and risk beliefs positively.\n\nHypothesis 1. Internet users' information privacy con cerns will have a negative effect on trusting beliefs.\n\nHypothesis 2. Internet users' information privacy con cerns will have a positive effect on risk beliefs.\n\nEvidence suggests that trusting beliefs also directly influence risk beliefs. For example, Moorman et al.\n\n(1992) argued that trust would reduce \"the per ceived uncertainty and hence the perceived vulner ability\" (p. 315). In other words, trusting beliefs are expected to mitigate risk perceptions. In the context of relationship marketing, Morgan and Hunt (1994) actually provided empirical support for the proposi tion mentioned above. Similarly, in a study of cross cultural online retailing, Jarvenpaa and Tractinsky (1999) found that trust had a negative influence on risk perceptions. Taken as a whole, the more trust a consumer has in an online firm, the less likely he or she is to foresee the risk in providing personal infor mation to the firm.\n\nHypothesis 3. Trusting beliefs will have a negative effect on risk beliefs.\n\nWithin the framework of reasoned action, behav ioral intention is a reliable predictor of actual behavior (Fishbein and Ajzen 1975, Ajzen 1991 We chose three items for control and three items for awareness that exhibited the most desirable psycho metric properties (Hair et al. 1995 1988). We adopted this two-step approach in which first a valid and reliable measurement was established, and subsequently the structural model of Figure 1 Rogers 1995). For this particular test, a modified GIPC scale, which included the word \"online\" in two of its three items, was treated as the standard measure reflecting privacy concerns (Smith et al. 1996); thus, we examined the correlation between GIPC and the scale in question (i.e., IUIPC or CFIP) as an indicator for the degree of the concurrent validity of the scale.4\n\nThe results showed that IUIPC had a stronger cor relation to GIPC (r = 0.59) than did CFIP (r -0.53). We further assessed the utility of IUIPC using dif ferent criteria. Understanding an individual's privacy concerns has significance to practitioners to the extent that it helps to predict various privacy-related behav iors. Thus, in this additional test, the utility of a scale is assessed by the correlation between a scale and a behavioral intention item toward a privacy-related behavior. We modified five behavioral intention items included in the study by Smith et al. (1996); specifi cally, the word \"company\" in the original items was replaced with \"online company.\" The five items are:\n\n(1) How likely are you to refuse to give information to an online company because you think it is too per sonal?, (2)   the scale development process (Straub et al. 2004, Campbell 1960. As discussed earlier, the trust-risk literature shows that personal disposition has sig nificant relationships with both trusting beliefs and risk beliefs (Mayer et al. 1995, McKnight et al. 1998).\n\nBecause the second-order IUIPC is conceptualized as personal disposition in this paper, its relationship with the beliefs constructs will indicate the nomolog ical validity of IUIPC.\n\nTo assess the nomological validity of IUIPC, we specifically examined the relationship between the second-order IUIPC, trusting beliefs, and risk beliefs. (/8 = -0.15, p < 0.01, Hypothesis 3 supported). We also found that intention was influenced positively by trusting beliefs (/3 -0.23, p < 0.001, Hypothe sis 4 supported) and negatively by risk beliefs (/3 = -0.63, p < 0.001, Hypothesis 5 supported). On the other hand, the results showed that the type of infor mation requested significantly influenced consumers' perceptions and intentions. In particular, more sen sitive information significantly decreased trusting beliefs (/3 = -0.13, p < 0.01, Hypothesis 6 supported), increased risk beliefs (/3 = 0.55, p < 0.001, Hypothe sis 7 supported), and decreased intention (/3 = -0.12, p < 0.01, Hypothesis 8 supported). Although the causal model seems to succinctly rep resent consumer evaluation and behavior, we found that the effects of control variables on the context contingent factors, i.e., trusting belief, risk beliefs, and intention, were not negligible-suggesting an area for potential improvement in the model. Specifically, 5 of 21 relationships (7 covariates * 3 context-contingent variables) were significant: Age was negatively related with intention (p < 0.05, two-tailed), education was negatively related with trusting beliefs (p < 0.01), Internet experience reduced risk beliefs (p < 0.001), the experience of identification falsification was neg atively correlated with intention, and media expo sure reduced trusting beliefs (p < 0.01). In contrast, no effects of gender and experience as victims were found on the context-contingent factors.\n\nFinally, we checked if the effect of IUIPC on inten tion was fully mediated by trusting and risk beliefs.\n\nAs a way of testing the mediation effect, the direct path from IUIPC to intention was added and allowed to be free. The result indicated that in spite of the added path, the decrease in chi-square value was insignificant [A^2(l) = 2.88, ns]. Indeed, the IUIPC intention path was found to be insignificant, thus sup porting the full mediation hypothesis.\n\n\nDiscussion and Conclusions\n\nThe objective of this study was three-fold: (1) to describe the nature of IUIPC based on SC theory, cerns for information privacy. Specifically, we dis cussed notions of (1) distributive, (2) procedural, and\n\n(3) interactional/informational justice and tied them with the dimensions of online privacy concerns-\"whether the exchange of personal information is equitable\" (collection), \"whether I have control over the data\" (control), and \"whether I am adequately informed about the use of the data\" (awareness). As shown previously, IUIPC, compared to CFIP, had a better model fit and a significantly stronger correla tion with criterion variables. These findings suggest that at least in the online privacy context, the cov erage of IUIPC includes and extends that of CFIP. Thus, our theory-driven approach to privacy concerns seems to nicely complement the traditional practice oriented approach. It is true that consumers' opin ions about such organizational practices as secondary use, improper access, and errors (i.e., CFIP) can rea sonably reflect their online privacy concerns.  et al. 1995, Fishbein and Ajzen 1975, Ajzen 1991 to perceive a lack of justice when they are not sat isfied with a marketer's actual information practice.\n\nBecause IUIPC is conceptualized/operationalized at a general level, perceived lack of justice, which is highly specific to a particular practice by the marketer, was not captured precisely in this study (Culnan and Bies 2003). Thus, further research should examine not only privacy concerns at a general level, but also per ceived problems within a particular context at a spe cific level.\n\nIn summary, information privacy has been fre quently identified as a major problem holding back consumer confidence in online business transactions.

'Less sensitive information (0), more sensitive information (1), positive effect -negative effect \u25ba . potential risks are present, trust plays an important role in determining one's (trusting/risk taking) behav ior (Luo 2002, Sirdeshmukh et al. 2002). This trust-risk model has been used to explain a variety of behav iors in an uncertain environment, including consumer firm relationships (Wulf et al. 2001, Jarvenpaa and Tractinsky 1999) and employee-organization relation ships (Mayer et al. 1995, McKnight et al. 1998). A great deal of the literature shows that trust and risk are the two most salient beliefs in information privacy-related contexts (Cespedes and Smith 1993, Milne and Rohm 2000, Miyazaki and Fernandez 2000, Sheehan and Hoy 2000). As shown in Figure 1, we include trusting beliefs and risk beliefs in the model to explain an indi vidual's release of personal information at the request of an online marketer. Trusting beliefs are defined asthe degree to which people believe a firm is depend able in protecting consumers' personal information(Grazioli and Jarvenpaa 2000, Gefen et al. 2003). On the other hand, risk beliefs refer to the expectation that a high potential for loss is associated with the release of personal information to the firm (Dowling and Staelin 1994).\n\nFigure 2\n2Results of SEM Analysis Notes. Completely standardized estimates, controlled for seven variables in the proposed model (Figure 1), model fit [x2(290) = 574.75; CFI = 0.95; CFI = 0.92; RMSEA = 0.047; CAIC = 1,399.16], 'p < 0.05, \"p < 0.01, *\"p < 0.001 (two-tailed).\n\n\nput it, \"the dimen sionality is neither absolute nor static, since percep shift over time\"(p. 190). This is especially the case given the fundamental change in the marketing envi ronment caused by the widespread adoption of the Internet. For instance, unlike traditional media, the In the domain of direct marketing, Phelps et al.tions \nof advocates, \nconsumers, \nand \nscholars \ncould \n\nInternet \nprovides \na variety \nof means \nfor consumers \n\nto control \npersonal \ninformation \nthat \nis stored \nin an \n\norganization's \ndatabase. Consequently, it is important \n\nto examine the shifting dimensions \nof privacy con \n\ncerns \nbecause \nInternet \nusers \nare likely \nto differ \nfrom \n\noffline consumers in their concerns about their per \n\nsonal information. \n\n2.2. Nature of IUIPC \n\nConsumers \nregard \nthe release \nof personal \ninformation \n\nas a risky transaction because they become vulnera \n\nble to a company's \npotential opportunistic behaviors \n\n(Milne and Gordon 1993, Laufer and Wolf 1977). For \nthis reason, a consumer's concerns about information \n\nprivacy cannot be fully understood \nwithout investi \n\ngating how individuals \ndefine justice in this long \n\nterm exchange of personal information. SC theory is \n\nespecially useful for studying perceptions of fairness \nand justice (Donaldson \nand Dunfee 1994). This notion \n\nof SC has been applied \nwidely to explain various \n\nphenomena \nincluding the consumer-firm relationship \n\n(Dunfee et al. 1999). This theory has also been used as \na conceptual tool for explaining consumer behavior in \n\nthe context of information privacy (Milne and Gordon \n\n1993, Culnan and Bies 2003). One of the main princi \n\nples of SC theory is that \"norm-generating microsocial \n\ncontracts \nmust \nbe grounded \nin informed \nconsent, \nbut \n\ntressed by rights of exit and voice\" (Dunfee et al. 1999, \n\np. 19). In other words, an equitable exchange involv \n\ning a long-term relationship should be accompanied \n\nby shared \nunderstanding \nabout \ncontractual \nterms \nand \n\nself-control over the course of the relationship. \n\nWhen applied \nto information privacy, SC theory \n\nsuggests that a firm's collection of personally identifi \nable data is perceived to be fair only when the con \n\nsumer \nis granted \ncontrol \nover \nthe information \nand \nthe \n\nconsumer is informed about the firm's intended use of \n\nthe information. As a result, it is possible to charac \n\nterize the notion of IUIPC in terms of three factors-\n\nnamely, collection, control, and awareness of privacy prac \ntices. The collection factor captures the central theme of \n\nequitable information exchange based on the agreed \nsocial contract. Meanwhile, \nthe control factor repre \n\nsents the freedom to voice an opinion or exit. Finally, \n\nthe awareness factor indicates understanding \nabout \n\nestablished conditions and actual practices. Thus, we \n\nconceptualize \nIUIPC as the degree to which an Inter \n\nnet user \nis concerned \nabout \nonline \nmarketers' \ncollec \n\ntion \nof personal \ninformation, \nthe user's \ncontrol \nover \n\nthe \ncollected \ninformation, \nand \nthe user's \nawareness \n\nof how the collected information is used. The three \n\nIUIPC \nfactors \nare described \nin detail \nas follows. \n\n2.2.1. \nCollection. \nThe very act of data collection, \n\nwhether it is legal or illegal, is the starting point \n\nof various information privacy concerns. We define \n\ncollection, the first dimension of IUIPC, as the degree \n\nto which \na person \nis concerned \nabout \nthe \namount \n\nof individual-specific \ndata possessed \nby others rela \ntive to the value of benefits received. This collection \n\nfactor is grounded on SC's principle of distributive \n\njustice, which relates to \"the perceived \nfairness of \n\noutcomes that one receives\" (Culnan and Bies 2003, \n\np. 328). In an equitable exchange, consumers give up \nsome information in return for something of value \n\nafter evaluating the costs and benefits associated with \n\nthe particular transaction. Thus, individuals \nwill be \n\nreluctant to release their personal information if they \n\nexpect negative outcomes (Cohen 1987). \n\n\n\n). The issue of control becomes more Control is an active compo nent of information privacy and it is often exercised through approval, modification, and opportunity topronounced \nwhen a large potential exists for oppor \n\ntunistic behavior and breach of the social contract in \n\na relational \nexchange. \n\nControl is especially important in the information \n\nprivacy context because \nconsumers \ntake high risks \n\nin the submission of personal information. Based on \n\nthe principles of procedural justice, moral contractors \n\nachieve control by exercising freedom to either accept \n\nor reject the process or decision outcome (Alge 2001). \n\nThus, \nwe \npropose \nthat \nan \nindividual's \nconcerns \nfor \n\ninformation privacy center on whether the individual \n\nhas \ncontrol \nover \npersonal \ninformation \nas manifested \n\nby the existence of voice (i.e., approval, modification) \nor exit (i.e., opt-out) (Caudill and Murphy 2000). \n\nSeveral studies have suggested that in reality peo \n\nple want to have the ability to control personal \n\n1 \nOperationally, \nthe collection \nscale measures \nthe degree to which \n\ncustomers \nare concerned \nabout data collection, but the other three \n\nfactors pertain to the items that ask what organizations \nshould do \n\nfor fair privacy practices (for the CFIP scale, see the appendix). \nWe \n\nbelieve that control and awareness \neffectively represent the other \n\nthree CFIP dimensions. \nWe test this proposition \n(i.e., comparison \n\nbetween CFIP and IUIPC). \n\ninformation. For example, Phelps et al. (2000) found \n\nthat most people (84%) wanted to have more control \n\nover \nthe \nuse \nof personal \ndata \nto restrict \nunwanted \n\ncommercial advertisements. Nowak and Phelps (1995) \n\nalso demonstrated \nthat people \nwere less worried \n\nabout data collection when they explicitly give per \n\nmission to firms or are given the choice to opt-out. \n\nThe Internet technologies offer flexible ways for con \n\nsumers \nto control \ntheir \npersonal \ninformation \nin an \n\norganization's \ndatabase. \nConsequently, \nlack of such \n\ncontrol \nwill \nincrease \nonline \nconsumers' \nprivacy \ncon \n\ncerns. Although \nless evident in CFIP, the control \n\nfactor is thus likely to be one of the most important \n\ncomponents reflecting IUIPC. \n\n2.2.3. \nAwareness \nof Privacy Practices. \nOn the \n\nbasis of a review of the literature, Foxman \nand \n\nKilcoyne \n(1993) \nargued \nthat information \nprivacy \nexists only when a person is (1) given control over \n\npersonal information and (2) informed about data col \nlection and other issues. opt-in \nor opt-out. \nIn contrast, \nawareness \nis a pas \n\nsive dimension of information privacy, and it refers to \n\nthe degree \nto which \na consumer \nis concerned \nabout \n\nhis/her awareness of organizational \ninformation pri \n\nvacy practices (Culnan \n1995, Foxman and Kilcoyne \n\n1993). Accordingly, the awareness \nfactor is highly \n\ninterrelated with, but distinct from, its active counter \n\npart (i.e., control) (Sheehan and Hoy 2000). \nThis awareness \nfactor incorporates \ntwo types of \n\njustices-interactional \nand informational justice.

In summary, \n\nTable 1 describes the major differences between GIPC, \n\nCFIP, and IUIPC. \n\n2.3. \nCausal Model \n\nA long-term exchange relationship in the context of \n\ninformation privacy is initiated when a consumer \n\nreleases \npersonal \ninformation \nto a marketer. \nThus, \n\nit is important \nfor researchers \nto understand \nhow \n\none determines \nto engage \nin this long-term rela \n\ntionship. Moreover, marketers will have great inter \n\nest in predicting \nconsumer \nreactions \nto requests \nfor \n\npersonal information. Accordingly, we developed \na \n\ncausal model to describe how IUIPC influences a con \n\nsumer's decision to release or not release personally \n\nidentifiable data in a certain situation. Depicted \nin \n\nFigure 1, the causal model is developed \nbased on the \n\ntrust-risk framework (Mayer et al. 1995, McKnight \n\net al. 1998, Jarvenpaa and Tractinsky 1999) and the \n\ntheory of reasoned action (TRA) (Fishbein and Ajzen \n\n1975). The research variables and their relationships \nin the model are explained in detail as follows. \n\n2.3.1. \nRelationships \nBetween IUIPC, Trusting Be \n\nliefs, Risk Beliefs, and Intention. In essence, \nthe \n\ntrust-risk model holds that in the situation in which \n\nThis content downloaded from 136.159.160.128 on Wed, 19 Nov 2014 17:59:32 PM \nAll use subject to JSTOR Terms and Conditions \n\n\n\nNote that the causal model implies that the impact of IUIPC on behavioral intention is fully mediated by trusting/risk beliefs. This is consistent with the premise of TRA that salient beliefs fully mediate the impact of individual differences on behavioral inten tion. Later, we will empirically examine whether this mediation proposition really holds in this particular explicitly within a causal model(Stewart and Segars  2002, Smith et al. 1996). To fill this gap in the liter ature, our model is specifically developed to controlfor the contingent effect of information on consumers' perceptions (Figure 1). In general, the causal model proposes that more sensitive information, compared with less sensitive information, will exert a more neg sequently, this request will reduce the level of trust. Moreover, when sensitive information is requested, risk beliefs are hypothesized to increase. Finally, the to reveal information that is more sensitive compared to information that is less sensitive.Thus, our final hypotheses are stated below. tioned previously may influence Internet users' re actions to information privacy threats. To control We conducted two empirical studies to develop and test a new scale of IUIPC. The purpose of Study 1 was Study 2 was designed to establish the second-order IUIPC factor with the combination of new (i.e., control and awareness) and existing (i.e., collection) scales. In The objective of Study 1 is to develop new scales for ondary use, improper access, and errors). To iden tify various forms of salient privacy concerns, we first reviewed the relevant literature in different dis ciplines including law, public policy, marketing, com munications, and information systems (Caudill and Murphy 2000, Culnan 2000, Goodwin 1991, Newman and Rao 2000,Regan 1995, Smith et al. 1996, Stewart   and Segars 2002. This literature review was followed by qualitative research in an effort to further elicit privacy concerns that might have been missed in the previous step(Straub et al. 2004). This qualitative the Internet for at least one hour in the previous month. Students in a marketing research class at a large southeastern university in the United States were given the task of collecting the survey data. Partial course credit was granted to each stu dent for administering the survey, and strict instruc tions were laid out with regards to the quality of data collection. In this field survey, we collected a total of). It seems fair \nto argue then that intention to release personal infor \n\nmation \nserves \nas a good \nproxy \nfor whether \none \nactu \n\nally reveals personal information at the request of an \nonline marketer. According to the trust-risk literature, \n\ntrusting/risk beliefs are expected to exert a significant \neffect on behavioral intention. For example, McKnight \n\net al. (1998) and McKnight and Chervany (2000) pro \n\nposed that trusting beliefs would directly influence \n\n\"trusting intention.\" Similarly, Jarvenpaa and Tractin \n\nsky \n(1999) \nshowed \nthat \n\"risk \nperception\" \naffected \n\none's willingness to buy books from websites. There \n\nfore, trusting/risk beliefs are likely to have a direct \n\ninfluence \non intention. \nThese \nhypotheses \nare depicted \n\nin Figure 1 and formally stated below. \n\nHypothesis \n4. Trusting beliefs will have a positive \n\neffect on intention to reveal personal information. \n\nHypothesis \n5. Risk beliefs will have a negative effect \n\non intention to reveal personal information. \n\ncontext. \n\n2.3.2. \nContextual \nVariable. \nIt is known that con \n\nsumers' reactions to privacy threats depend on the \n\ntype of information requested by marketers (Phelps \net al. 2000, Sheehan \nand Hoy 2000, Wang and \n\nPetrison 1993). All things being equal, releasing more \n\nsensitive \ninformation \nis perceived \nas more risky \n\nthan releasing less sensitive information (Milne and \n\nGordon 1993). Although the perceived sensitivity of \n\ninformation varies widely with individual differences, \n\nin general financial data and medical information are \n\nknown to be viewed by consumers as more sensitive \n\ninformation; in contrast, at an aggregate level, lifestyle \ncharacteristics and shopping/purchasing \nhabits are \n\nconsidered \nless sensitive by consumers \nthan finan \n\ncial data and medical information (Nowak and Phelps \n\n1992, Sheehan and Hoy 2000, Phelps et al. 2000). The \n\nvalidity of a certain model cannot be established until \nit is shown to hold across a variety of personal data \n\nrequested \nby marketers. \n\nDespite the importance \nof this contextual differ \n\nence \nresulting \nfrom \nvarious \ninformation \nrequests, \n\nfew \nstudies \nhave \ntaken \ninto \naccount \nsuch \ndifference \n\native effect on consumers' \nattitudes and intentions \n\ntoward revealing personal information. Specifically, \n\nwe expect \nthat a marketer's \nrequest \nfor more \nsensitive \n\ninformation \nwill \nmake \na consumer \nsuspicious; \ncon \n\nmodel \npredicts \nthat consumers \nwill \nbe more \nreluctant \n\nHypothesis \n6. A marketer's request for more sensitive \n\ninformation will have a negative effect on trusting beliefs. \n\nHypothesis \n7. A marketer's request for more sensitive \n\ninformation will have a positive effect on risk beliefs. \n\nHypothesis \n8. A marketer's request for more sensitive \n\ninformation will have a negative effect on intention to \nreveal personal information. \n2.3.3. \nCovariates. \nFactors \nother \nthan \nthose \nmen \n\nfor those \nunknown \neffects, \nwe \nhave \nincluded \nsev \n\neral covariates in the model. Specifically, we included \n\nthree demographic \ncharacteristics: \nsex (Milne and \n\nRohm 2000), age (Culnan 1995, Milne and Rohm 2000, \n\nWang and Petrison 1993), and education \n(Culnan \n\n1995, Milne and Rohm 2000, Phelps et al. 2000, Wang \nand Petrison 1993). In addition, the causal model \n\nis tested with four additional \nvariables \nrelated to \n\npersonal experiences: Internet experience (Milne and \nRohm 2000, Phelps et al. 2000), how often subjects \n\nprovide falsified identification information to a mar \nketer (Hoffman et al. 1999, Pew Internet Project 2000), \n\nwhether the subject's privacy has been invaded in the \n\npast (Culnan 2000), and the amount of exposure to \nmedia reports of incidents of privacy invasion (Smith \n\net al. 1996). Consequently, \nas Figure 1 shows, a total \n\nof seven control variables are taken into account in \n\nthe causal model. \n\n3. Methodology \n\nto develop measures for new dimensions \nof privacy \n\nconcerns \n(e.g., \ncontrol \nand \nawareness) \nthat were \nnot \n\navailable from existing scales (e.g., collection, unau \n\nthorized secondary use, improper access, and errors). \n\nthis latter \nstudy, \nwe \nalso \nformally \ntested \nthe research \n\nmodel and hypotheses. \n\n3.1. \nEmpirical Study 1 \nprivacy \nconcerns \nthat \nwere \nnot \npart \nof the existing \n\nCFIP dimensions \n(i.e., collection, unauthorized \nsec \n\nresearch \nwas \nconducted \nthrough \npersonal \ninterviews \n\nwith three subject matter experts and a group inter \n\nview with eight Internet users in a nonstructured and \n\nnatural manner (Malhotra 2004). As a result, a pool of \n\nnew \nitems \nwas \ncreated \nto reflect \nInternet \nusers' \ninfor \n\nmation privacy concerns. This first pool included 7 \n\nawareness items, 15 control items, and 21 other items \n\nthat could potentially constitute online consumers' \n\nprivacy concerns (e.g., security, honesty, the seal of \n\nassurance, \nsocial responsibility, etc). To reduce the \n\nlength of the questionnaire, \nthe existing scales were \n\nexcluded from this item pool. \n\nA structured questionnaire \nwas developed \nbased \n\non the pool of new items. The survey was admin \n\nistered to household \n(nonstudent) \nrespondents who \nhad used 293 completed questionnaires. \nMen (49%) and women \n\n(51%) were almost equally represented, and an aver \n\nage respondent was 35 years of age and had 4.5 years \nof Internet experience. The median household income \n\nper year was \n$60,000, \nand \n71% \nof the respondents \nhad \n\nbachelor's degrees or higher. \n\nTo discover discernible patterns of privacy dimen \n\nsions, we performed \nexploratory \nfactor analysis \n\n(EFA). From the results we found that control and \n\nawareness \nclearly \nemerged \nas \nindependent \nfactors. \n\n\n\n\nat the initial stage, a consumer's opinions about an unknown firm will be similar to his or her opinions about typical firms. The appendix shows the specific items used in this study.). Each of these \n\nselected items loaded higher than 0.70 on the desig \n\nnated factor and at the same time loaded less than \n\n0.40 on other factors (Chin et al. 1997). Consequently, \n\nthese six items, along with the existing four items for \n\nthe collection factor adapted from CFIP, represented \n\nthe 10-item IUIPC scale in the following study. \n\nThis content downloaded from 136.159.160.128 on Wed, 19 Nov 2014 17:59:32 PM \nAll use subject to JSTOR Terms and Conditions \n3.2. \nEmpirical Study 2 \nTo control for the effect that the type of informa \n\ntion \nhad \non \nconsumers' \nreactions, \nwe \nemployed \nan \n\nexperimental design with a scenario-creation \nmethod \n\n(Webster and Trevino 1995, Straub and Karahanna \n\n1998). Specifically, two types of scenarios were cre \nated according to the sensitivity of the personal infor \n\nmation requested (for the categorization \nof personal \n\ninformation requested, see Phelps et al. 2000). The \n\nType A questionnaire \npresented a scenario in which \n\nrespondents \nwere asked to provide personal shop \n\nping preferences in return for free membership, worth \n$50, at a discount store (less sensitive information). \n\nType B presented the same scenario but the informa \ntion requested concerned personal financial informa \n\ntion (more sensitive information). In general, financial \n\ninformation is perceived \nto be more sensitive than \n\npersonal preferences (Sheehan and Hoy 2000). There \nfore, Type B should be viewed \nas a more sensi \n\ntive situation than Type A. A pretest was conducted \n\nthat \nconfirmed \nthe nature \nof the two \nscenarios.2 \nWe \n\nemployed a between-subjects \ndesign in which respon \ndents were given only one of the two scenarios \n\n(Keppel 1991). \n\nBoth \nscenarios \nhad \na common \nset of items \nthat was \n\nindependent \nof the type of information requested. \n\nAmong \nthe items were demographic \ninformation, \n\ngeneral consumer behavior, and the three information \n\nprivacy scales (GIPC, CFIP, and IUIPC). \nScales spe \ncific to the scenarios were trusting beliefs, risk beliefs, \n\nand intention. Note that the operationalization \nof \n\nthese \ncontext-contingent \nfactors \nwas \ndirected \ntoward \n\nonline marketers in general as opposed \nto a specific \n\nfirm. This was done because respondents could not \n\nbe expected to have a meaningful experience with \n\nthe hypothetical firm in the scenario. McKnight et al. \n\n(1998) proposed \nthat initial trust would depend on \n\n\"institutional cues that enable one person to trust \n\nanother without firsthand knowledge\" \n(p. 474). That \nis, 2 Note that in this discount store example requesting \nfinancial infor \n\nmation, as opposed \nto personal \npreferences, will be thought to be \n\nlargely inappropriate. \nThis also made Type B more sensitive than \n\nType A. \n\nTo collect data, we conducted personal interviews \n\nsimilar to those of the first study. For this second \n\nstudy, interviewers were recruited from a different \n\nmarketing research class to collect a fresh set of data. \n\nUsing the personal contact information, we ensured \n\nthat \nthe respondents \nin the previous \nstudy \nwere \nnot \n\nincluded in the second study. As a result, we collected \n\na total of 449 usable questionnaires \nfrom household \n\nrespondents \nin one-on-one, \nface-to-face \ninterviews. \n\nThe sample consisted of 217 Type A and 232 Type B \n\nrespondents. The demographic \nprofile of the respon \ndents was comparable \nto that of the first study (54% \n\nmale, 53% 35 years of age or older, a median \nof \n\n4.5 years of Internet experience, a median income of \n\n$60,000, and 76% bachelor's \ndegrees or higher). No \n\nsignificant differences were found between the two \n\ntypes of data (A and B) in terms of gender, age, Inter \n\nnet experience, \nincome, \nand \neducation. \n\n3.3. \nMeasurement \nModel \n\nThe psychometrics \nliterature suggests that to avoid \n\nmisinterpretation \nof structural \nrelationships, \nre \n\nsearchers should first estimate a measurement model \n\nbefore testing hypotheses \n(Anderson \nand Gerbing \n\n\n\nTable 2\n2Estimated Factor Correlation Matrix from the Revised Measurement Model IUIPC and CFIP. This fact seems to pose less con cern because IUIPC is assumed to include and extend CFIP. In other words, by definition, the two constructs are destined to be strongly correlated in many occa sions. Meanwhile, the other two violations were iden tified within CFIP and IUIPC, respectively. Flowever, because of the size of the correlation matrix, which 506.20]. The CAIC index also indicates that IUIPC (CAIC = 236.65) represents the reality better than CFIP (CAIC = 506.20), at least in this particular con text. In general, the results indicated that IUIPC efficiently and effectively reflected Internet users' concerns for information privacy.Correlation matrix \n\n\n\n\nIUIPC related to other variables in a way that is highly consistent with theory and past find ings, thus providing empirical evidence of the nomo logical validity of the proposed scale (Straub et al.The \nresults \nof CFA \nshowed \nthat \nthe fit of the model \n\nwas acceptable: \n^2(114) = 290.36, CFI = 0.95, GFI = \n0.93, RMSEA = 0.059, CAIC = 567.53. We also found \nthat IUIPC strongly correlated with trusting beliefs \n\n(r = -0.43, p < 0.001) and risk beliefs (r = 0.38, p < \n\n0.001). Recently, Pavlou and Gefen (2004) examined \n\nthe relationships \nbetween \ntrust propensity, \ntrust, \nand \n\nperceived \nrisk to study potential buyers' bidding \n\nbehaviors in online auction. Their study reported that \n\nthe correlation between trust propensity and trust in \n\nsellers was 0.56 and that between trust propensity \n\nand perceived risk from sellers was -0.25. Consider \n\ning that IUIPC resembles distrust propensity, the signs \nand magnitudes of the correlations between the two \n\nstudies are quite comparable. \nOverall, our findings \nindicate that 2004). \n\n3.6. \nStructural Model and Research Hypotheses \n\nWe tested the causal model using the structural equa \n\ntion modeling \n(SEM) \ntechnique.5 Figure 2 reports \nthe results of SEM analysis. Fit indices indicate that \n\nthe model is a realistic representation \nof the data \n\n|>2(290) = 574.75, CFI = 0.95, GFI = 0.92, RMSEA = \n\n0.047, CAIC = 1,399.16]. \nFurthermore, \nthe model \n\nexplained \na fair amount of the variance in the out \n\ncome variables; for example, it explained 66% of the \n\nvariance in intention to give personal information. \n\nWe found that all of the hypotheses proposed in the \n\ncausal model were supported. Specifically, as hypothe \n\nsized, IUIPC had a negative effect on trusting beliefs \n\n(/3 = -0.34, p < 0.001, two-tailed, Hypothesis 1 sup \n\nported) and a positive effect on risk beliefs (j8 = 0.26, \n\np < 0.001, Hypothesis 2 supported). In addition, trust \n\ning beliefs had a negative impact on risk beliefs \n\n5 We also estimated \nthe fit of the structural equation \nmodel with \n\nthe second-order \nCFIP. The model fit was slightly worse than that \n\nof the second-order \nIUIPC: \n^2(434) \n= 890.18, CFI = 0.94, GFI = \n\n0.89, RMSEA \n= 0.048, CAIC = 1,792.771. \nThe model with CFIP also \n\nexplained \n21% of the variance in trusting beliefs, 50% in risk beliefs, \n\nand 66% in behavioral \nintention. \n\n\n\nFinally, recall that IUIPC draws on SC theory, which sheds light on the nature of long-term relationships between stakeholders. Meanwhile, this study demon strated that the trust-risk framework, which also deals with the issues related to long-term relationships, as tentative until the effect of the scale modification is fully understood. Our main objective in comparing IUIPC and CFIP was to provide additional evidence on the efficacy of IUIPC, as it is a new scale. Second, not the results of this study retain their validity with different contextual variables, e.g., type of informa tion requested, reward offered by marketers(Phelps   et al. 2000, Sheehan and Hoy 2000). Third, our study did not examine the impact of IUIPC on actual behav ior. Although behavioral intention is known as a reli able predictor of actual behavior(Ajzen 1991), the theoretical framework presented in this paper should be reexamined with an additional measure of actual behavior using a longitudinal design. Last, the selec ers and data collected for this study was specific to a given geographic location (i.e., the southeastern United States). Although this type of convenience sampling is more the norm than the exception in the IS domain (e.g.,Smith et al. 1996, Stewart and Segars   2002), care must be taken in any effort to generalize our findings beyond the boundary of our sample.First, the borderless nature of the new economy is making the issue of online privacy more compli cated than ever before(Milberg et al. 1995). To design information practices that fit a particular local mar ket, global companies should first understand how consumers in the local area of interest define fair ness in the context of information privacy. We believe that the theoretical framework presented in this study will provide a solid basis for examining cross-cultural variations in consumer behavior. Second, this study considers two types of beliefs as most salient in the context of information privacy-namely, trusting beliefs and risk beliefs. Yet, it is possible that other forms of beliefs also play an important role in con sumer behavior. For example, individuals are likely). As \n\nexpected, \nthis was \nthe case \nin this \nparticular \nstudy. \n\nSpecifically, from the results of the causal model, we \nfound that the correlation between the second-order \n\nIUIPC and behavioral intention was -0.32.6 Given the \n\nmoderate level of correlation, IUIPC alone will not \n\nbe able to explain more than 10% of the variance in \n\nbehavioral intention (Fornell and Larcker 1981). Fur \n\nthermore, when trusting beliefs and risk beliefs were \n\n6 We do not report the statistical details because of space limitations. \n\ncontrolled \nfor, no direct \neffect of IUIPC \nwas \nfound \non \n\nbehavioral intention. This finding implies that trust \n\ning beliefs and risk beliefs mediated the impact of \nIUIPC on behavioral intention. \n\nWhile focusing on consumers' \nprivacy concerns \nin general, privacy research in the IS domain has \n\npaid little attention to consumers' \nperceptions spe \ncific to a particular context (Smith et al. 1996, Stewart \n\nand Segars 2002). However, \nour findings clearly \n\nreveal \nthat to have \na complete \nunderstanding \nof con \n\nsumer \nreactions \nto information \nprivacy-related \nissues, \n\nresearchers \nshould \nexamine \nnot only \nconsumers' \npri \n\nvacy \nconcerns \nat a general \nlevel, \nbut \nalso \nconsider \n\nsalient beliefs and contextual differences at a spe \n\ncific level. Overall, this study indicates that consumer \n\nbehavior in the context of information privacy is a \n\ncomplex \nphenomenon; \nthus, \nresearchers \nshould \nbe \n\nready to employ sophisticated techniques to examine \n\nconsumers' \nreactions \nto information \nprivacy \nthreats. \n\ncould be seamlessly \nintegrated with the SC-based \n\nIUIPC \nconcept. \nFurthermore, \nwe \ndemonstrated \nthat \n\nintention models such as TRA were also helpful in \n\nunderstanding \nrelational exchange especially within \n\nthe context of information privacy. Consequently, one \n\nof the major contributions of this study is to develop \n\nthe causal model integrating SC theory, the trust \n\nrisk framework, and TRA. We believe that the causal \n\nmodel \nwill \nserve \nas a useful \nconceptual \ntool \nfor fur \n\nther research on the relational exchange of personal \n\ninformation \nbetween \nconsumers \nand \nmarketers. \n\n4.2. \nManagerial \nImplications \n\n4.2.1. \nIUIPC. \nOur findings imply that the 10-item \n\nIUIPC scale, along with the 15-item CFIP scale, will \n\nbe a worthy candidate for consideration \nas an indi \n\ncator of online consumers' privacy concerns. From a \n\nmanagerial \nperspective, the lower number of items \nincluded in the IUIPC scale is desirable as a means \n\nof reducing the data-collection \ndemands imposed on \n\nrespondents, the length and duration of the question \n\nnaire, and the cost of data collection. Nonetheless, it \nshould also be noted that the validity of IUIPC has \nyet to be established in contexts other than the Inter \nnet. Thus, practitioners will continue to have the need \n\nto rely on CFIP for many applications. \n\nOne of the major findings of this study is that online \n\nconsumers consider it most important to (1) be aware \n\nof and (2) have direct control over personal informa \n\ntion stored in marketers' databases. \nTherefore, at the \n\nvery least, managers should make sure that their con \nsumers can easily check what type of information is \n\ncollected, whether the information is correct, and how \nthis information is used in and outside the organi \n\nzation. In addition, as mentioned earlier, consumers \n\nshould be allowed \nto control, i.e., add, delete, and \n\nmodify at will, the information in the organization's \ndatabase. This research suggests that these organiza \n\ntional efforts can jointly soothe an individual's \ninfor \n\nmation privacy concerns (Stewart and Segars 2002). \n\n4.2.2. \nCausal \nModel. \nConsumers' \nprivacy \ncon \n\ncerns are certainly a driving force of their reactions \n\nto a certain organizational \npractice. Yet, our find \n\nings suggest that trust in a marketer can significantly \n\nmitigate perceived risk and ultimately a customer's \nreluctance in releasing personal information. Thus, \n\nit is important for managers to understand how to \n\nboost customers' trust in their firms' handling of per \n\nsonal information. Drawing on Zucker's (1986) trust \n\nproduction mechanisms, Luo (2002) proposed several \n\ntechniques such as third-party seal programs that are \n\nbelieved \nto facilitate \nthe relational \nexchange \nof per \n\nsonal \ninformation \nbetween \nconsumers \nand \nmarketers. \n\nThese techniques will be instrumental for practition \n\ners to collect more valuable information without nec \n\nessarily invading consumer privacy. \nUnlike European countries with general and strict \n\nprivacy laws, the United States has industry-specific \n\nregulatory rules (Culnan \n2000). Thus, consumers' \nreactions to information privacy threats will vary with \n\nrespect to the type of industry sector. Consequently, \nit is important for practitioners to understand \nnot \n\nonly privacy concerns in general (i.e., IUIPC), but also \nan individual's \nperceptions specific to the sector (i.e., \ntrust and risk beliefs). The causal model proposed in \n\nthis study incorporates both types of concepts to facil \n\nitate \nthe \nin-depth \ninvestigation \nof consumers' \nreac \n\ntions to an industry-specific practice. We hope the \n\nproposed model will be helpful in providing further \n\ninsight into the problems as they manifest in various \n\nways within industry (e.g., financial, medical, etc.) \n\nsectors. \n\n4.3. \nLimitations and Further Research \n\nSome limitations of this study should be mentioned. \n\nFirst, we modified the wordings of the original CFIP \n\nscale to suit the purpose of this present study-the \n\nexamination of online privacy concerns. We found that \n\nthe revised CFIP scale was reliable and valid, but it \n\ndid not perform as well as IUIPC in this particular \n\ncontext. Nevertheless, the efficacy of IUICP over CFIP \n\nin the context of online privacy should be considered \n\nwe \ncontinue \nto contend \nthat consumers' \nreactions \nto \n\na specific privacy threat are highly dependent on con \n\ntextual \nfactors. \nThus, \nit remains \nto be seen \nwhether \nor \n\ntion \nof the \nrespondents \nwas \nleft \nto the \ninterview \n\nOpportunities \nfor further research are abundant. \n\n\n\n\nTo address this problem, we should first understand cerns. This article introduced a 10-item scale of IUIPC, which was shown to reasonably represent the dimen cerns negatively influenced their willingness to carry on relationships with online companies. We hope that many researchers will employ the theoretical frame work and the new scale for further investigation ofthe \nvery \nnature \nof online \nconsumers' \nprivacy \ncon \n\nsionality of privacy concerns, categorized \nas collec \n\ntion, control, \nand \nawareness. \nUsing \nthis scale, \nwe were \n\nalso \nable \nto demonstrate \nhow \nconsumers' \nprivacy \ncon \n\nthis important area. \nto Senior \nEditor \nRobert \nZmud \n\nand Associate \nEditor \nDetmar \nStraub \nfor their valuable \nhelp \nand guidance \nthroughout \nthe review \nprocess. \nHelpful \nand \n\nconstructive \ncomments \nprovided \nby the three anonymous \n\nInformation \nSystems \nResearch \nreviewers \nare deeply \nappreci \nated. \nThe authors \nare grateful \nto Jan Heide \nat the Univer \n\nsity of Wisconsin \nand Robert \nPeterson \nat the University \nof \n\nTexas for their valuable \ncomments \non earlier versions \nof this \n\npaper. \nThe authors \nwould \nalso like to thank Seoyoung \nKim \n\nfor her help with literature \nreview \nand J.
