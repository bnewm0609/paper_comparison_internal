Index Terms-Cellular network, human-centric service (HCS), integrated sensing and communication (ISAC), machine learning (ML), radio frequency (RF) fingerprinting positioning.\n\ncommunication system (B5G/6G) is expected to build an integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) framework enabled by 5G ultradense cellular networks [1]. In this case, the cellular system is used as a large-scale network sensor to measure the surrounding environment based on wireless perception and provide environment and location awareness services in a spectrum/energy/cost-efficient way [2]. On one hand, 6G research has been reviewed by higher frequency bands, wider bandwidths, and larger antenna arrays to provide better personalized service [3], [4]; On the other hand, machine learning (ML) has been used to improve user service systems and address new challenges [5], such as ML-based indoor/outdoor (IO) detection that is proposed to adjust the network to enhance the environment type-based user services.\n\nThe global navigation satellite system (GNSS)-based positioning method basically satisfies the criteria of outdoor positioning, yet it is limited in the confined environments, such as urban canyon and overpass. This is due to the shielding effect on satellite signals, which results in satellite researching in a time-consuming way. To shorten the time delay, radio frequency (RF) fingerprinting positioning has been integrated into long-term evolution (LTE) architecture by 3GPP to provide outdoor emergency positioning services, such as enhanced 911 (E911) [6], [7], [8], [9]. RF fingerprinting positioning provides complementary or alternative GPSrelated information by comparing the similarity between the user's received signal strength and this fingerprint database [10], [11]. Currently, RF fingerprinting positioning is widely adopted in various networks, which can be extended as endogenetic sensor, without major replacements to the network infrastructure [12], [13].\n\nAt present, wireless network testing has shifted to user active reporting mode to replace the traditional drive test with consuming large amounts of the manpower and material resources, large capital investment, and long test cycle. 3GPP release 10 (TR 32.827) opens the opportunity to collect data autonomously from mobile devices, which is also called minimization of drive test (MDT). The cellular big data including RF fingerprints collected in the MDT method are cost-effective for operators and carbon-neutral for the public [14]. However, since the data collected by MDT through the terminals are automatically reported by users, the indoor and outdoor measurement reports (MRs) are jumbled up in the database, which is able to affect the positioning performance. In some cases, mobile devices entering the room from outside still retain outdoor GPS information, so these kind of indoor data carry drifted GPS information, as well as the indoor devices near windows or exits. These data samples collected as fingerprints cannot represent the real position of the devices, which can be regarded as noise for positioning. Due to the poor regularity of pedestrian movement and limited actual measured data, the recognition of indoor and outdoor scenarios using communication data is of importance for contextualizing network operations including positioning error reduction.\n\nPerception and classification of IO scenarios is the prerequisite of interference elimination. The most common method is to rely on GNSS signals that cannot cover indoors to form positioning for judgment. Nevertheless, regardless of the time delay or the possible deviation of GPS in a semiindoor scenario, it is unreliable to solely rely on GPS for IO classification. Lee et al. [15] use GPS and temperature data to classify IO, and the accuracy is about 85%. Table I shows the comparison of various solutions for IO classification. Pissardini and Fonseca Junior [16] construct a decision tree using different parameters including signal strength for IO classification. The highest accuracy evaluated on the real datasets reaches to 98%. Zhu et al. [17] exploit a hidden Markov model with stacking ensemble, which achieves an accuracy up to 99%. Zou et al. [18] make use of iBeacons for IO classification, and Mizuno et al. [19] use beacons and GPS information for indoor and outdoor scenarios, respectively, but the limitations including sensor installation and operator cost make these solutions difficult to be applied on a large scale. Ashraf et al. [20] use the magnetometer widely present in mobile phones to separate IO samples and the achieved accuracy based on naive Bayes is 83%. Liu et al. [21] harness the cellular data collected by the smart phone merging with the light sensor to classify IO scenarios and the resulting accuracy is above 98%. Li et al. [22] build a radio map using the light intensity and magnetism in combination with the cellular data and achieve the classification accuracy up to 92%. Li et al. [23] use light intensity and WiFi signal for the weak learner to detect \"indoor, outdoor, and semi-open\" (IOS). Wang et al. [24] divide the IO classification into four different labels and calculate the statistical features to train a classifier. The K -nearest neighbor (KNN)-based method reaches an accuracy up to 97%. In addition, Rodriguez et al. [25] and Kaya and Calin [26] discuss the scheme of classification based on the differences between IO scenarios in terms of radio propagation.\n\nThe advantages and disadvantages of different localization models and architectures are shown in Table II. Recent 3GPP NR positioning systems support solutions of observed time difference of arrival (OTDOA) [27], uplink time difference of arrival (UTDOA), angle information, multicell round trip time (Multi-RTT), and Enhanced Cell ID (ECID) in Release 16 [28], [29]. In the LTE system, the ECID method is widely used for positioning based on the received signal strength, which exploits radio measurements to determine a distance to the terminal. Therefore, this method can also be treated as a fingerprinting method [30]. Aly and Youssef [31] match the cellular fingerprints with the information collected by the built-in sensor of the mobile phone to further improve the performance of the entire positioning system. Tian et al. [32] propose to exploit the subspace identification approach for large-scale RF fingerprints' prediction and it is proven effectively that it improves the positioning performance in urban outdoor scenes. Viel et al. [33] propose a new mapmatching algorithm that exploits the hidden Markov model and random forests to process noisy and sparse cellular signal. In [34], the performance of random-forest-based fingerprinting positioning is further improved by considering problems related to signal variations in communication issues, multipath fading, and surrounding interference. ML has been studied to improve the performance of positioning system [35], [36]. Butt et al. [37] minimize the position error of the mobile users by building feature vectors based on deep learning. Prasad et al. [38] propose a supervised ML approach based on Gaussian process regression to position users in a distributed massive multiple-input-multiple-output system (DM-MIMO). Sou et al. [39] exploit a particle Markov chain model for indoor localization on wireless fingerprint systems. Polak et al. [13] provide an extensive performance study of different ML algorithms to improve RF fingerprinting-based indoor localization.\n\nTo our best knowledge, there is no integrated research on IO sensing and positioning based on RF communication signals for cellular network operation. This article presents an experimental study for IO sensing-assisted RF fingerprinting positioning. Our main contributions are as following.\n\n1) More than 56 000 MRs are collected in a real urban area covered by the commercial cellular network. The test scenarios include most of the main roads and seven different indoor scenarios in this area.  the basis of IO classification to refine this framework of integrated IO sensing and positioning. The rest of this article is organized as follows. Section II describes the actual measurement campaign and presents the information contained in the MRs. Section III describes the ML-based integrated IO sensing and positioning framework. Section IV shows the experimental results, discusses the effects of different parameters on localization, and refines scene classification. Finally, we conclude our work in Section V.\n\n\nII. MEASUREMENT CAMPAIGN\n\nIn the MDT system, the users upload MRs automatically, so the mobile terminals are able to use the run-time database to locate. For complying with the trend of MDT continuously replacing the traditional drive test, the measurement data are collected by TEMS INVESTIGATION [40] from a realistic urban area in China, which is covered by the commercial cellular network. We simulate the process of collecting MRs automatically in the MDT system through the actual drive test with intensive sampling, which has practical significance for further HCS.\n\nThe specific measurement configuration in the LTE network is shown in Table III. At each sampling point, the information from a serving cell and several neighboring cells is able to be  Fig. 1) and record the raw data MRs for postprocessing.\n\nA variety of information are contained in MRs, 1 including the cell ID and the corresponding reference signal received power (RSRP) of the serving cell and its six neighboring cells. The staple network key indicators are described as follows.\n\n1) E-UTRAN Cell Identifier: The unique identifier of the cell.\n\n\n2) Latitude & Longitude:\n\nThe recorded GPS coordinates of the user equipment (UE).  \n\n\n3) RSRP & Reference Signal Received Quality (RSRQ):\n\nIndicators of received signal strength and quality, as the main metrics for IO classification and RF fingerprinting positioning. 4) Timing Advance (TA): Transmission timing between the UE and the eNodeB. During the moving process of UE, the KPIs of MRs vary among scenarios and locations due to the coverage of different evolved NodeBs (eNBs). For example, Fig. 2 shows the change in RSRP of the outdoor data samples. Therefore, the fingerprint-based scenario sensing is performed to further investigate the positioning error change. Specifically, the outdoor measurement is carried out in different ways on the main roads and some branches, and the indoor data samples are collected in various indoor scenarios. Seven specific test points are indicated in Fig. 2 to show the diversity of indoor scenarios. GPS signal is unable to be detected in the deep indoor (DI) scenarios like the shopping mall, which results in unsuccessful positioning. Our measurement campaign approves the MI scenarios, where the indoor samples collected close to the windows have deviations from the actual GPS coordinates. Therefore, it is necessary to classify the scenarios and denoise the data before localization, which is beneficial to improve the positioning accuracy for a specific scene.\n\n\nIII. SCHEME DESIGN\n\nSince the positioning error is affected by the deviation of the indoor MRs, the scheme is devised to reduce the positioning error by filtering the positioning fingerprints through ML before positioning. This design is mainly divided into two parts. A random-forest-based IO classifier is implemented to sense the mobile scenarios and preprocess the database for filtering the positioning fingerprints in the first part. In the second part, the weighted K -nearest neighbor (WKNN)-based ECID method is used for RF fingerprinting positioning. Subsequently, we compare and evaluate the system performance quantitatively from different aspects.\n\nThe scheme process is shown in Fig. 3. \"I + O\" means that there are both indoor and outdoor fingerprints in the database before IO classification, and \"O\" means that only outdoor fingerprints are contained in the database after denoising.\n\n\nA. Random-Forest-Based IO Classification\n\nEnsemble learning accomplishes the learning tasks by constructing and combining multiple base learners, which aims at predicting the target value (scenario label) of the test set based on the original measured data effectively. Compared with a single decision tree, a random forest gathers the predictions of all individual trees in the training process, and the final prediction is made based on the majority of votes which can lead to better classification results.\n\nFeature engineering refers to the process of converting the initial data into the model training data, and then obtaining better training data features to improve the model performance, which mainly includes feature extraction and feature selection. The MRs are divided into the training set and test set. We build the KPI-based feature engineering combined with the characteristics of radio propagation to train random forest and label samples for indoor and outdoor. Then the trained model is adopted to classify the test set.\n\nThe previous work in [41] demonstrates that random-forestbased IO classification is more suitable for processing cellular big data with multiple features and 20 variables can be used to classify effectively. For example, the RSRP and RSRQ of hearable cell are directly used to determine indoor and outdoor scenarios; UEs located at the edge of the cell can be judged by calculating the difference between the RSRP and RSRQ of the serving cell and the strongest neighboring cell; the difference between the RSRP estimated through the Cost 231 Hata channel model and the measured RSRP of the serving cell is calculated as the IO classification feature, and the formula is as follows:\nRSRP = RSTP \u2212 (46.3 + 33.9log( f ) + 44.9 log(78T a ) + C) \u2212 RSRP (1)\nwhere f and C denote the carrier frequency and correct factor (=3 for metropolitan areas), respectively. T a represents the TA.\n\nThere are about 29% of the samples which are excluded from the bootstrap sample during the algorithm operation, which are called the out-of-bag (OOB) data. Fig. 4 shows that the OOB error is lower than 3% and converges when reaching 20 growing trees. Since the OOB error and the accuracy of  Accurate IO classification result is beneficial to remove the interference of indoor fingerprints, which is the basis for improving the positioning accuracy. After classifying the IO scenarios effectively, we remove the indoor MRs that deviate from the actual location based on their labels. Subsequently, the raw MRs containing both the outdoor and indoor fingerprints and the denoised outdoor MRs are used as databases for positioning to discuss the impact of the MLbased fingerprint denoising on the positioning performance.\n\n\nB. Improved WKNN-Based RF Fingerprinting Positioning\n\nThe RF fingerprint-based positioning method mainly includes two stages: offline collection and online positioning, as shown in Fig. 5. During the offline collection process, large amounts of radio measurements in different scenarios are collected by the mobile device through the simulated MDT and imported into the mobile positioning system (MPS). The RF server compresses the radio measurements into a size-efficient data file for the serving mobile positioning center to use. The MR-based fingerprint database is stored The WKNN-based ECID merging with MR method is used for cellular positioning, and the specific steps of the algorithm are demonstrated in Fig. 3. First, checking the validity of the data in the positioning REQ and deleting duplicate data. Using the data filtering mechanism, the fingerprints far away from the user are filtered from the fingerprint database according to the number of neighboring cells. Then, calculating the similarity based on RSRP by least mean square (LMS) to take the top 50 fingerprint records, and adjusting the similarity according to TA to take the top K fingerprints. Finally, determining the confidence and using the similarity as the weight coefficient in the WKNN algorithm to calculate the final position, which is represented by the latitude and longitude of the center of the generated ellipse.\n\n1) Data Filtering Mechanism and Similarity Calculation: Due to thousands of fingerprint records in the fingerprint database, the positioning speed and accuracy are greatly affected without a suitable data filtering mechanism. Therefore, the main purpose of data screening is to perform matching calculations within a limited area according to the number of neighboring cells and find candidate MRs in the fingerprint database to reduce the positioning error and the amount of calculation. Specifically, when the REQ has one neighboring cell (REQ Nb = 1), we first try to find the MRs with only one neighboring cell in the fingerprint database (MR Nb = 1), and then it is strictly required that the serving cell ID (Serv ID ) and the first neighboring cell ID (Nb1 ID ) of the selected MR and REQ are the same, respectively. If no such MR is found, the condition that the RSRP of the second neighboring cell of the candidate MR (MR Nb2_RSRP ) must be 20 dB lower than the RSRP of its serving cell (MR Serv_RSRP ) is requested on the basis of possessing the same cell ID. When REQ Nb \u2265 2, the MR is selected as long as its Serv ID or Nb1 ID is the same as Serv ID or Nb1 ID of the REQ. When REQ Nb = 0, if MR Nb = 0, only MR Serv_ID = REQ Serv_ID is required; otherwise, it is also necessary that the RSRP of the first neighboring cell (MR Nb1_RSRP ) is much less than MR Serv_RSRP .\n\nThe similarity of the candidate MRs subjected to the data filtering mechanism needs to be calculated to select the closest fingerprint. The similarity of the nth fingerprint record is denoted as d(n), and the degree of similarity decreases with the increase in d(n). The LMS-based method is defined as\nd(n) = i ( f i \u2212 g i (n)) 2 + j f j \u2212 l min 2 M(2)\nwhere f i and g i (n) denote the RSRP of the REQ and the RSRP of the nth MR in the i th cell, respectively. l min represents the missing signal level values, which is used to penalize the cells that are not matched in the REQ. M is the total number of sum of summations. Therefore, a larger d(n) results a smaller similarity. The similarity calculation process is as follows (see Fig. 6). We traverse all the cells in the REQ, and it should be noted that the comparison between REQ and alternative MR is based on the cells of REQ. If the cell in the REQ is not in the MR, the penalty from the second summation in the formula is generated. Therefore, when REQ Nb \u2265 2, d(n) and the corresponding l min are set, while there is no need to consider the second summation of the formula when the neighboring cell of REQ is 0 or 1.\n\n2) Similarity Adjustment According to TA: TA can be converted into the distance between REQ and the serving cell, which is set as parameter T a . As defined in 3GPP [42],\n1T a = 16 \u00d7 T s = 16/(15 000H z \u00d7 2048) \u2248 0.52 \u03bcs,\nwhere T s is the elementary time unit of the LTE network, so 1T a map to the distance between eNB and UE is (300 000 km/s \u00d7 0.52 \u03bcs)/2 = 78 m. The similarity between REQ and MR is estimated and adjusted with the TA Factor. First, find the longitude and latitude of the serving cell of REQ in the cell database, and calculate its distance from the MR. Then, the actual distance from the user to the serving cell is estimated according to the TA of the REQ, and the two distance values are compared. If the distances are consistent within a certain range, the similarity cannot be changed; otherwise, the similarity can be adjusted.\n\n3) WKNN Algorithm: After using the data filtering mechanism to select candidate fingerprints, we calculate the similarity of each fingerprint data according to the similarity calculation rule. Then, the similarity can be used as the weight coefficient in the WKNN algorithm to obtain the predicted position, which is expressed by the latitude and longitude of the center of the generated ellipse.\n\nAccording to the WKNN algorithm, select K MRs to estimate the final position, and the estimated position (EstPos) can be given by\nEstPos = K n=1 (w(n) \u00d7 P(n))(3)\nwhere P(n) is the position of the nth fingerprint record, and w(n) can be given by\nw(n) = 1 d(n) K n=1 1 d(n) (4)\nwhere d(n) is the similarity of each fingerprint record.\n\n\nIV. RESULT ANALYSIS\n\nMore than 56 000 MRs are captured in the commercial cellular network of typical urban areas by drive test with TEMS. Fig. 7 shows the RSRP distribution of the serving cell and its neighboring cells in the first 600 fingerprint records in the MR. The RSRP is roughly concentrated in the range of \u221275 to \u221295 dBm, and the RSRP of the serving cell is higher than that of the neighboring cells, which is suitable for the actual situation.\n\nIn the process of scenario sensing, about 56% of the fingerprints are selected for training the random forest model, and the remaining are used as the test set for classification prediction and subsequent positioning. In the process of RF fingerprinting positioning, 75% of the 24 456 fingerprint records are randomly selected to construct a fingerprint database, and the others are used as the positioning test data. Since massive fingerprints of UEs are recorded by MDT, the REQs of the users in different locations and the MRs in the database are overlapped to a large extent. Therefore, 50% of the fingerprints in the test set are randomly selected and put back into the database to ensure the result more realistic.\n\nPositioning precision (error) and positioning accuracy (probability) are selected as evaluation indicators of the positioning system. Positioning precision is the error between the obtained data and the real data. Positioning accuracy judges the correct positioning result. In a word, precision and   accuracy are two contradictory concepts in positioning, which need to be balanced according to practical application. The location of the UE positioning requirements is determined by FCC for a mobile operator, which is within 100 m for 67% and 300 m for 90% [7]. The probability of the positioning error in the range of x is defined by cumulative density function (cdf). The size of the error is shown in the horizontal axis, and the error distribution is shown in the vertical axis. Fig. 8 shows comparison of the cdf of the original positioning results with the results after filtering indoor fingerprints. The probability growth trend is similar to the positioning error, and the probability after denoising is more precise when the positioning error is constant.\n\nTable IV visualizes the positioning error in different positioning probabilities before and after denoising. When the positioning probability reaches 67%, the positioning error is marked as \"67% error.\" The following conclusions are obtained from the table.\n\n1) The original positioning result outperformed the FCC positioning requirements, which rises the difficulty of reducing the positioning error as well. 2) Precision and accuracy are two contradictory concepts in positioning, which need to be balanced during the whole data processing procedure. 3) If the probability maintains the same, the overall positioning error can be reduced using the IO classifier to filter the positioning fingerprints or promoting the position precision. In particular, the positioning error after denoising is reduced by about 4% when the probability is 67%, and the positioning error is reduced by 2% when the probability is 80% and 90%. In conclusion, the positioning accuracy improves significantly in case of the probability decreasing.\n\n\nA. Comparative Experiment\n\nThe proposed method is compared with the state-of-theart (SOA) to better demonstrate its effectiveness. An in-depth analysis of IO classification is conducted in our previous paper [41], and experiments reveal that random forest can efficiently classify indoor and outdoor fingerprints and reduce the data dimensionality. In comparison to other popular ML algorithms such as support vector machine (SVM) or KNN, the ensemble learning method could process the vast data with a large amount of variables, and the capability of dealing with unlabeled data promoted random forest to be an optimal choice for IO classification based on cellular big data. Moreover, SVM and WKNN are also widely used for IO localization [13], and thus, we choose these two methods to compare with the proposed improved WKNNbased localization method. Since the WKNN algorithm is included in the proposed method, the parameter settings are consistent. In addition, the SVM is trained with the radial basis function (RBF) kernel and the regularization parameter C = 20. The results in Table V demonstrate that SVM performs slightly worse since it is better suited to sparse and small sample data. Moreover, when compared with WKNN, our proposed method based on the improved WKNN is able to significantly improve the positioning precision. This occurs as a result of the addition of a data filtering mechanism prior to positioning, which effectively lessens the positioning error and calculation.\n\nFor further analysis, we take the problem of whether the reduction of data in the fingerprint database caused by denoising has an influence on the positioning system performance into consideration. Comparative experiments of randomly removing fingerprints based on the raw database are performed, and it has to be noted that the same amount of data as the indoor fingerprints are supposed to be randomly removed to ensure the consistency of data size.\n\nTen comparative experiments are performed based on the raw fingerprint database (I + O). Table VI indicates that no matter how many experiments are performed, the positioning error is larger than that after denoising with the same amount of data when the probability is the same. On one hand, the noise interference of positioning caused by indoor fingerprints need not be removed completely in the process of randomly removing MRs. On the other hand, the reduction of outdoor effective fingerprints also leads to an increase in positioning error. Moreover, the positioning error of comparative experiments is also larger than the raw data, which means the reduction of data is unable to improve the positioning precision, but worsens the positioning performance.\n\n\nB. Positioning Error Under Different K Values\n\nThe initial K value is set to 8 in this article. The positioning results under different K values are analyzed based on the WKNN matching algorithm. K is selected as 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, and 10, respectively, to locate based on the fingerprint database before and after denoising.\n\nThe positioning error generally decreases first and then increases with K when the WKNN algorithm is simply used. When K is small, the algorithm is prone to be interfered by abnormal points. Once a point with a large error appears, it is difficult to use other adjacent points to correct the error. When K is larger, there are more nearby points to correct the error so that the error is reduced. However, when K is too large, the positioning error also becomes larger due to the increase in nearby points far away from the UE [43], [44].\n\nThe positioning error with 67% and 90% is obtained in Fig. 9. It shows that the positioning error after fingerprint denoising becomes smaller regardless of the value of K , which further proves the effectiveness of removing the noise interference of indoor data for improving positioning precision. However, the positioning errors before and after database denoising increase with K in Fig. 9(a), which is different from the general situation. This is because we have screened the fingerprints twice in the previous steps of the RF fingerprinting positioning, in addition to using the WKNN algorithm for location matching. As a result, the points with large error have been filtered out. Therefore, REQ can be directly matched to the same or the most similar MRs in the fingerprint database when K = 1. And the MRs far away from UE rise with the increase in K , which results in a reduction of positioning performance.\n\nThe cdf under different K values is shown in Fig. 9(b), which indicates the positioning performance is best when K = 1. It is worth noting that limited MRs are collected in the drive test, while massive MRs are automatically reported by UEs at various scenarios in actual situations. Therefore, the choice of K value cannot be generalized, but needs to be analyzed according to the databases with different data sizes and distributions.\n\n\nC. Positioning Error Under Different Data Return Ratios\n\nMassive fingerprint records of UEs are automatically uploaded to the server by MDT in the actual situation. About 50% of the fingerprints from the REQs are randomly selected to put back into the database so as to meet the actual situation that there is overlap between REQs and MRs. To explore the impact of data return ratio on positioning error, we randomly select 25%, 50%, and 75% of the REQs to put back into the fingerprint database.\n\nThe positioning error of different data return ratios under different K values is shown in Table VII. Regardless of the data return ratio, the positioning error increases with an increase in K and decreases after fingerprint denoising, which is consistent with earlier observations. Moreover, with the increase in fingerprint records in the database, the positioning error decreases following the increase in the data return ratio, and there is a more significant error change.\n\n\nD. IO Classification for REQs\n\nSince the REQs contain both the outdoor data and indoor data, which are unable to be accurately estimated, IO classification for REQs needs to be used to extract outdoor REQs to investigate the effect of database IO classification on outdoor positioning error. [I + O] represents the data before IO classification, and [O] represents the outdoor data obtained after IO classification.\n\nThe effect of fingerprint denoising on outdoor positioning error is discussed in Table VIII. For outdoor positioning, the same positioning error is achieved before and after filtering out indoor MRs. It means if the REQ is marked as outdoors, the amount of data is reduced by database preprocessing, and hence the efficiency of positioning and the utilization of the database are improved.\n\nThe positioning error is unable to be compared accurately due to the different amount of REQs, so comparative experiment is performed based on the raw REQ[I + O]. As a result, the amount of the remaining REQs which come from both indoors and outdoors is the same as REQ [O]. As shown in Table VIII, the overall positioning error of REQs comparative experiment is smaller than that of REQ[O] with the same data size, which indicates that some indoor REQs are able to be successfully located. Although the GPS carried by some indoor data is biased, it is still used for positioning. It is also located successfully with small error due to the smaller indoor area and the more concentrated sampling.\n\nIn addition, the change regularity of the positioning error before and after denoising is the same as that of the raw REQ[I + O]. Moreover, the reduction of the total amount of REQs leads to the reduction of effective positioning REQs, so the positioning error becomes larger.\n\n\nE. Further Classification for Database\n\nSince part of the indoor fingerprints with biased GPS are able to be used for positioning, indoor MRs are further divided into DI (DI fingerprints without GPS) and MI (MI fingerprints with GPS) by judging whether there is GPS information. The positioning error under different databases is shown in Table IX, where REQs belong to \"I + O.\"\n\nThe positioning error of further retaining MI MRs is smaller than that of only outdoor MRs kept. This is because MI fingerprints in the database are used to achieve positioning for some indoor REQs with less error. It should be noted that although these indoor REQs can be successfully located, the EstPos is inaccurate due to the inherent deviation of GPS. Although GPS is unable to be used for indoor positioning, it is collected near windows or in a semi-indoor scenario similar to a balcony (see Fig. 2), which leads to the results that the estimated location is outdoor with its actual location indoor. Therefore, the reliability of the EstPos obtained in this case is low.\n\nSimilarly, comparative experiments are conducted to eliminate the impact of different data sizes on positioning error for further classifications. In this case, the positioning error varies according to the ratio of MI and outdoor MRs. The outdoor positioning error is larger than the indoor error, so it has a greater effect on the overall error. In brief, the positioning error increases due to the reduction of outdoor MRs.\n\nIn addition, the framework of integrated IO sensing and positioning is better realized when REQs are also further classified before positioning. We use communication signals to sense the mobile scenarios where UEs report REQs, and then match REQs with the classified MRs in the database. On one hand, the positioning precision and efficiency are improved. On the other hand, different judgments are made on the results obtained in different scenarios, and then targeted researches are conducted to improve the performance.\n\n\nV. CONCLUSION\n\nIn this article, we present an ML-based integrated IO sensing and positioning framework for sensing the mobile scenarios and reducing the positioning error based on the MRs obtained in the commercial cellular network. By comparing the positioning error, preprocessing the database using the IO classifier is proven to be effective in filtering fingerprints for RF fingerprinting positioning (the accuracy of IO classification reaches up to 97%). The integrated IO sensing and positioning approach gives smaller positioning error and offers further personalized services based on the refined contextualizations, compared with the conventional fingerprint-based positioning. Moreover, five evaluation experiments are conducted to analyze the results, making the framework more convincing and universal. The proposed framework is suitable for MDT by which users automatically upload massive data, thus can be easily extended to more refined and dynamic scenario sensing and positioning tasks for HCS upgrades.\n\nAs for future work, we consider filling in more accurate GPS for indoor MRs to reduce the deviation of indoor positioning. According to the radio propagation rules, the GPS of indoor MR is replaced with that of the most similar outdoor MR. Moreover, the existing outdoor data are able to be used for trajectory prediction to provide better personalized services.\n\n2 )\n2An ML-based integrated IO sensing and positioning framework is proposed to sense the mobile scenarios and reduce the RF fingerprinting positioning error. The positioning results show that denoising the database by IO classifier can effectively reduce the RF fingerprinting positioning error up to 4% under Federal Communications Commission (FCC) positioning standard.3) The positioning performance is evaluated by different data sizes and parameters of the positioning algorithm.The further data analysis shows that the setting of these parameters has an impact on the positioning error, and the MRs collected in the mild indoor (MI) scenarios have a positive effect on the overall positioning error. In this case, further classification for database is carried out on\n\nFig. 1 .\n1Schematic of the measurement campaign.\n\nFig. 2 .\n2Measurement sites and RSRP distributions.\n\nFig. 3 .\n3Scheme flowchart.\n\nFig. 4 .\n4OOB error with the growing of decision trees in random-forestenabled IO classification. the ensemble model are complementary, which further shows that the classification accuracy of this model reaches 97%.\n\nFig. 5 .\n5RF fingerprinting positioning schematic. by MPS, which provides high-precision positioning service.
