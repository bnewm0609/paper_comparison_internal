INTRODUCTION\n\nE LECTRIC vehicles (EV) are considered one of the most promising solutions toward the decarbonization of the transport sector, and Li-ion batteries are one of the key technologies to enable the techno-economical viability of mass-adopted EVs. Anyhow, Li-ion batteries typically preserve 70%-80% of their initial capacity when retired from EV use [1]- [3]. Such batteries, no longer useable for electro-mobility applications, would still be capable to provide energy storage services in other less-demanding applications, in which battery performance, volume, and weight boundaries were not so critical.\n\nThe topic of battery reuse has been addressed since the appearance of the first commercial EV models, and several studies evaluated the economic viability of the so-called second life battery usage [2]- [5]. Reusing EV batteries provides an alternative revenue stream for a product that otherwise would be at a disposal stage. This fact is increasingly getting the attention of important original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) like Nissan-Renault, BMW, Tesla or Daimler [6], [7]. According to a study by Bloomberg New Energy Finance, the global second life batteries market could reach 26 GWh by 2025 [8]. Such figures would represent almost one third of the total amount of batteries retired from EVs, ca. 47% of the global Li-ion battery supply in 2015 [9] and ca. 65% of the estimated global EV battery demand in 2016 [10]. Reusing this significant amount of batteries depicts a great opportunity not only for automotive industry but also to other industry players. Moreover, beyond a purely economic motivation, second life batteries represent an alternative to other energy storage solutions, which could avoid or defer the manufacturing of new systems, leading to indirect environmental footprint mitigations [11], [12].\n\nIn order to ensure the economic and environmental profitability of second life batteries, guaranteeing an appropriate and long-lasting battery performance after their automotive retirement would be crucial. Nevertheless, most of the publications presented in this field rarely emphasized on the battery performance, and very few address battery ageing aspects [13]- [15].\n\nThis paper is part of the FP7 European project \"Batteries 2020,\" which covered extensive first life battery testing and modeling activities [16], [17]. This paper focuses on the experimental evaluation of EV second life battery performance, addressed considering two different second life stationary applications: a residential demand response management service [18] and a power smoothing application for a grid-scale photovoltaic (PV) plant [19]. Cell-level capacity fade and dc internal resistance increase were evaluated to analyze the suitability of such second life batteries for each of the aforementioned applications. In addition, the effects of cell-to-cell variability are also studied at the stack level. Homogeneous and heterogeneous stacks were built, each of them being composed of three cells connected in series. The goal was to address how cell-to-cell heterogeneity could affect the energy storage system (ESS) performance and, in consequence, second life battery degradation. This paper extends the results previously published in [19]. The paper begins with the description of the two applications considered for the experimental testing of second life batteries. Then, the defined testing methodology is explained, describing the tests at both the cell and stack level and the tests performed during an individual cells characterization stage. Next, the main experimental results are presented and discussed. Finally, conclusions and future work are stated.\n\n\nII. APPLICATION CONSIDERED FOR THE SECOND LIFE BATTERY TESTING\n\nTwo main applications were considered for the second life battery testing.\n\nOn the one hand, a Spanish residential household was considered, composed of residential loads, a roof-mounted PV system, and a second life battery energy storage system (herein referred as SLBESS). This application represented a low-demand application, in which low current rates (C-rate) and low depth of discharge (DoD) cycles are typically required. The block diagram of the residential application is shown in Fig. 1(i).\n\nOn the other hand, a SLBESS was also considered to mitigate the power variability of a grid-scale PV plant. The unpredictable nature of intermittent renewable energy resources produces significant variability on the power output provided to the grid. Therefore, implementing an SLBESS to reduce such power variability represents a high-demand application, especially in terms of C-rate, DoD, and number of cycles-per-year. The block diagram of the power smoothing renewable energy integration application is displayed in Fig. 1(ii).\n\nIn order to calculate the power required from the battery and draw an application specific testing profile, a dedicated methodology was defined, which mainly relies on the optimal sizing of the SLBESS, as described in Fig. 2. The optimal sizing approach followed for each of the selected applications was described in depth in [18] and [20]. The optimal sizing calculated allowed obtaining the one-year duration SLBESS power demand profiles, for each of the two selected applications. Such profiles were then adapted to cell-level one-year power profiles, valuable for the second life battery testing labors addressed in this paper.\n\nWith the purpose of accelerating second life battery ageing tests, such one-year battery cell current profiles were synthesized into one-month profiles (one for each of the two applications). These one-month profiles also increased the representativeness of the data obtained during monthly characterization tests, since every month the same realistic operation profile was applied.  The steps carried out for the synthesis of the application profiles are summarized as follows.\n\n1) Elimination of the pauses: In the two applications, batteries remain much of the time at an idle state. It was assumed that these idle periods would significantly slowdown the overall ageing performance of the batteries [21]. Thus, eliminating the pauses led to approaching one-month duration profiles from the original one-year profiles, while accelerating the expected ageing behavior of the second life batteries. 2) Selection of one-month length profile: After suppressing the pause periods, the most representative parts of the shortened profile were selected to produce a one-month duration profile.\n\n\n3) Insertion of storage events of pseudorandom duration:\n\nA percentage of short storage events was introduced intentionally to avoid excessive and unrealistic ageing due to unstopped cycling [22]. The duration of such eventual pause periods was statistically modeled from the original one-year profiles. In the case of the residential application, the electrical current rate was additionally increased by a magnification factor. Accordingly, the duration of each charge or discharge pulse in the profile was divided by the same magnification factor. Thus, the magnification factor contributed to accelerating battery degradation, while respecting the original state of charge (SoC) profile of the residential application.\n\nThe one-month duration profiles of both residential and power smoothing applications are shown in Fig. 3. Compared to the original one-year application profiles obtained from the sizing approach, the synthetic power smoothing application profile comprises the cycling of a two-year operation on a single month. Similarly, the synthetic residential application profile covers ca. 65% of the cycles performed during the one-year operation. Note that the synthetic profiles developed served to evaluate the capabilities of second life batteries to fulfill the cyclability demands on each of the selected applications. Nevertheless, the results based on these synthetic profiles do not consider the effect of calendar ageing during the idle periods present in the real operating conditions.\n\n\nIII. BATTERY TESTING METHODOLOGY\n\n\nA. Test Plan at Cell Level and Stack Level\n\nThe battery reference considered for the present analysis was a 20 Ah nickel manganese cobalt/carbon (NMC/C) based Liion cell. All the cells included in the analysis were subjected to laboratory ageing tests during their first life. Although the use of batteries retired from EVs could also be appropriate for the designed testing methodology, this study only considered batteries aged in the laboratory in order to totally control the battery operating conditions. This should facilitate observing the influence of certain first life operating conditions upon the second life battery performance. In all the cases, the end of life (EOL) represents the retirement point from the first life testing, rather than a real cell retirement from an EV. Cell surface temperatures and operation current and voltages, besides cell state of health (SOH) (both in terms of actual capacity and dc internal resistance), were monitored during first and second life use in order to simplify the analysis of the main ageing causes during battery entire life.\n\nTwo main experimental activities were considered for the analysis of the battery ageing behavior: 1) testing at cell level; and 2) testing at stack level.\n\nIt was expected that both first life history-i.e., EV use of the batteries-and the selected second life application may have a significant effect on second life battery degradation. For this reason, cells with different first life ageing conditions were analyzed under the two considered application profiles. On the one hand, cells aged in first life according to realistic EV profiles (based on Worldwide Harmonized Light Duty Test cycle, WLTC) were used for testing second life batteries at the cell level. On the other hand, cells aged in the first life phase according different static ageing conditions were also tested both at the cell and stack level. Further information on the considered static conditions (ageing matrix) and the implemented realistic operation profiles can be found in [21]. Stack testing only covered the power smoothing renewable integration application since the greater demands from such application would result in more cost-and time-efficient laboratory testing labors. Each stack was formed by three cells connected in series, in which no battery management system (BMS) was implemented.\n\nThe SOH level of the cells at first life end of life (FL-EOL) was also expected to be a key factor affecting the battery performance and their degradation behavior during the second life use. Therefore, cells at different SOH levels were included in the analysis, and SOH heterogeneity was also taken into account to group the cells at each stack. Two homogeneous stacks and another two heterogeneous stacks were built. Homogeneous stacks were composed of cells with the same first life history and the similar SOH level. Heterogeneous stacks were built according to two different criteria: 1) using cells with very different first life history and with very different SOH levels, and 2) using two cells coming from the same first life condition and a third one coming from a different first life condition, with a SOH level different from that of the two remaining cells forming the stack. The objective was to build stacks with a different grade of heterogeneity, to evaluate how it may affect the second life battery electric performance at the stack level.\n\nThe whole test plan is summarized in Fig. 4, which indicates the distribution of cells coming from different first life conditions to cell level or stack level second life tests. All the ageing tests were performed on a controlled environment at 35\u00b0C in order to accelerate experimental laboratory testing labors. Indeed, the obtained first life battery testing results [21] confirm that at such temperature the selected batteries degrade observably faster than at room temperature, while avoiding any unintended alteration on the internal ageing processes. Prior to the starting of each cycling phase (according to the corresponding realistic synthetic profile), the cells on each stack were balanced to 3.703 V (ca. 50% SoC) on a constant current (CC)-constant voltage (CV) charge or discharge mode. Then, the whole stack was charged or discharged to 11.109 V in order to ensure that every test started from the same voltage conditions.\n\n\nB. Characterization Procedures\n\nAfter every month of testing with the synthetic profiles defined in the previous section, each tested cell or stack was subjected to a cell level characterization test sequence at 25\u00b0C. The aim of the monthly characterization stage was to evaluate the evolution of relevant battery cell parameters, such as capacity, internal resistance, efficiency, etc. Four significant points were identified in the ageing evolution of the tested cells, which are relevant for the proper understanding of the obtained results.\n\n1) First life beginning of life (FL-BOL), which served as the reference for all the internal cell parameters monitored. 2) FL-EOL, which represents the moment when the batteries are retired from the automotive use. A short checkup was composed of a capacity test and a hybrid pulse power characterization (HPPC) test. A detailed checkup additionally included quasi-open-circuit voltage versus SoC measurements and impedance parameterization tests via electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. Each of these tests consisted of the following. 1) Capacity test: A consecutive sequence of full CC-CV charges to the cell maximum voltage and CC discharges to the cell minimum voltage, at C/3 current rate, and repeated three times. The CV phase was finished when the current decreased to C/25. Pauses of 30 min were introduced after each charge or discharge. The capacity measured during the last discharge was considered the current capacity of the cell. 2) qOCV versus SoC test: A full discharge at C/5 followed by a full charge at C/5 (only CC charge, no CV phase). A 30 min pause was introduced after every charge or discharge. The low current rate employed in this test allows observing the voltage plateaus of the cells. The electrodes' phase changes and cell degradation phenomena were evaluated through incremental capacity and differential voltage curves. 3) HPPC test: A charge/discharge pulse train composed of 10 s current pulses at \u00b10.5 C, \u00b11 C, \u00b11.5 C, \u00b12 C, and \u00b12.5 C. Between pulses, 5 min pauses were introduced. The pulse train was repeated at 80%, 50%, and 20% SoC. 30 min pauses were introduced after taking the cell to each SoC level (on Ah-based discharges). From this test, the dc internal resistance and the power capabilities of the cell were calculated at different levels of SoC, and for different current rates. Every month a short checkup was performed, while at FL-BOL, SL-EOL and every three months a detailed checkup was performed instead. The particular context of the project \"Batteries 2020\" forced cell transfers among partners between FL-EOL and SL-BOL for some of the planned second life tests. For the correct tracking of battery status, and in order to evaluate cell relaxation effects during storage and transportation periods (between first life and second life), a detailed checkup was also performed both at FL-EOL and SL-BOL.\n\n\nIV. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION\n\nIn this section, the most relevant second life battery ageing results obtained are summarized, considering the following: 1) homogeneous stacks performance; 2) heterogeneous stacks performance; 3) the impact of different second life applications. Table I summarizes the cell selection carried out for the second life battery testing labors. As it can be observed, cells from very different first life testing conditions were selected, after performing a different amount of full equivalent cycles (FEC), and at different levels of degradation (in terms of remaining capacity and dc internal resistance at FL-EOL and SL-BOL). In the figures presented in this section, a common nomenclature is maintained, as shown in   pacity and the dc resistance measured for each cell at FL-BOL, respectively.\n\n\nA. Homogeneous Stacks S1and S4\n\nThe two homogeneous stacks served as a reference to evaluate the second life performance of the several tested cells, as the cells on each of such homogeneous stacks would theoretically behave identically due to their equal first and second life testing conditions. As it can be observed in Fig. 6(i), the stack S1 was composed of three cells tested according to the same first life conditions. The performance of the three cells was almost identical in the first life, and also in the second life. Only minor differences in the measured dc internal resistance could be observed, which were attributed to experimental deviations when calculating the reference dc internal resistance values at FL-BOL. Nevertheless, the dc internal resistance evolution was similar in the three cases. Fig. 6(ii) shows the first life and second life ageing performance of the three cells in the homogeneous stack S4. As it can be observed, the cells forming the stack S4 experienced an initial increase in the capacity (above the 100% defined by the FL-BOL capacity). This behavior, which was experienced by most cells in this study, was attributed to the passive electrode effect, analyzed in depth in several literature references [23], [24]. After performing ca. 8000 FEC in the first life, the three cells in stack S4 retained ca. 100% remaining capacity at FL-EOL, hence serving as a reference to evaluate the impact of the first life ageing history on the second life battery ageing performance. The three cells showed no significant capacity fade or dc internal resistance increase during the first life and provided a very similar performance during the second life. As in the previous case, only minor differences were measured in the dc internal resistance values.\n\nAll the cells in the homogeneous stacks S1 and S4 withstood more than four months of second life testing, which would correspond to the cycling of ca. eight years operating in the targeted power smoothing renewable energy integration application. However, the effect of calendar life ageing would need to be assessed for thorough and accurate second life battery lifetime estimation.\n\n\nB. Heterogeneous Stack S2\n\nThe cells forming the heterogeneous stack S2 were selected considering limited heterogeneity level. Cells C5 and C6 were subjected to identical first life ageing conditions, while cell C4 underwent more demanding first life conditions. Fig. 7 shows the capacity and dc internal resistance evolution of the three cells forming the heterogeneous stack S2. In Fig. 7(i), the ageing behavior of the three cells in this stack is represented against the number of FEC performed, to assess how differences in the operating conditions may have affected their ageing performance. Similarly, since the amount of FEC-per-day varies among the selected cells and during the first and second life usage, Fig. 7(ii) represents the ageing performance versus the testing time. Additionally, the representation against the testing time allows more clearly observing the transition from first to second life.\n\nThe three cells experienced a very similar ageing behavior during the first life, as it can be observed in Fig. 7(ii). However, the cell C1 experienced a faster capacity fade per FEC, as it can be observed in Fig. 7(i). Thus, the cell C1 was retired from first life testing at ca. 97.8% remaining capacity after only performing ca. 500 FEC, while cells C2 and C3 still retained ca. 95% at FL-EOL after performing ca. 1900 FEC. As a consequence of cell relaxation after a cycling-intensive phase in the transition from first to second life, a reversible capacity increase was recorded on cells C2 and C3, as reported on previous studies in the literature [25].\n\nThe ageing performance of the three cells during second life testing (according to the power smoothing application) showed a very similar trend for the first six months of second life testing. Comparing the ageing behavior of the three cells during first and second life, no significant change in the ageing rate was observed [see Fig. 7(ii)]. However, when represented against the performed FEC [see Fig. 7(i)], cell C4 seemed to experience a slight slowdown in the ageing trend, due to the milder operating conditions in the second life testing phase, compared to its first life testing conditions. After sixth months of second life testing, cell C4 experienced a significant acceleration in terms of dc internal resistance increase rate and also started to accelerate its capacity fade rate. In the case of cells C5 and C6, a homologous acceleration on the ageing trend was experienced, but only after the tenth month of second life testing. The synthetic profile of the power smoothing application comprises the cycling of a two-year operation on a single month of testing (as mentioned in Section II). Thus, these cells would be capable of withstanding the long-term operation on the power smoothing application-yet the degradation due to calendar life would have to be considered, which would also be superposed to the degradation by cycling [16]. According to the experimental results, the cell C4 would withstand the cycling equivalent to ca. 12 years of operation in the considered second life power smoothing application before experiencing the so-called ageing knee. Then, cell C4 was removed from testing (SL-EOL), and the remaining cells C5 and C6 were kept being tested. These two cells C5 and C6 withstood the cycling equivalent to ca. 20 years of cycling in such application before experiencing the ageing knee (change in the ageing trend).\n\nThe appearance of the ageing knee suggests a change in the dominant ageing mechanism, which was attributed to metallic lithium deposition (or lithium plating). All the three cells experienced the ageing knee when still retaining more than 90% of the initial capacity, after ca. 1650 FEC and ca. 700 testing days in the case of cell C4, and after ca. 3650 FEC and ca. 890 testing days for cells C5 and C6.\n\n\nC. Heterogeneous Stack S3\n\nThe first life ageing conditions of the three cells in the stack S3 were very different, in terms of temperature, C-rate, DoD, SoC, calendar time, and FEC (see Table I). As it can be observed in Fig. 8, their remaining capacity was different at FL-EOL. Similarly, the dc internal resistance was observably different among the three cells at FL-EOL. Regarding the second life ageing phase, the three cells considered in the heterogeneous stack S3 displayed an unequal evolution.\n\nThe cell C7, with ca. 88% remaining capacity at FL-EOL, showed a very small capacity recovery in the transition from first to second life. On the contrary, the dc internal resistance showed a significant increase from FL-EOL to SL-BOL (ca. 65%), following the large change recorded in the last part of the first life ageing phase. The evolution trend recorded in first life suggested a shift in the dominant ageing mechanism [26]- [28]. After few weeks of testing in second life, such cell bulged and it had to be removed from testing.\n\nIn the case of the cell C8, the second life testing started after ca. 240 days of storage between FL-EOL and SL-BOL. The cell C8 was subjected to high C-rate charges/discharges during first life, which could have caused lithium plating, and may be considered the main cause of such sudden capacity decrease from ca. 95% to ca. 80% at FL-EOL. Similarly, the dc internal resistance appeared to experience a significant increase during the last period of first life testing (from ca. 100% up to ca. 225% at SL-BOL). Such an alteration in the ageing evolution suggests a change in the dominant ageing mechanism, suddenly leading to the so-called ageing knee. After only one month of second life testing, the capacity of the cell decreased to 43% of the initial capacity, confirming the sharp performance fade reported in the transition from FL-EOL to SL-BOL and, hence, the aforementioned change in the dominant ageing mechanism. The SL-EOL dc internal resistance could not even be measured since the voltage limits of the cell were continuously reached during the HPPC test. Such significant and sudden increase in the dc internal resistance could also be related to electrolyte decomposition, as a consequence of lithium plating [29]. The cell was removed from testing as it was not able to fulfill the testing profile due to the very low energy that it was able to supply.\n\nThe cell C9 was subjected to calendar life ageing during first life. At FL-EOL, the cell still retained 84% of its initial capacity. The dc internal resistance kept growing until FL-EOL, reaching 166% dc internal resistance increase. After ca. 100 days of storage in the transition from first life to second life, the cell C9 showed a slight capacity recovery, yet the dc internal resistance continued increasing up to 183%. Such a significant internal resistance increase during the transition from first to second life again suggests an ageing acceleration, which aroused between the 300th and the 400th day of testing. Similar to the case of the cell C7, the cell swelled after few weeks of second life testing and it was immediately removed from the experimental setup.\n\n\nD. Testing at Cell Level\n\nAs in the case of the heterogeneous stack S2, the ageing performance of the cells tested at the cell level is reported both against the FEC performed and the testing time, to totally represent how the changes in the operating conditions from first life to second life affected cells' ageing performance. Fig. 9 shows the second life ageing performance of two individual cells, C13 and C14, both sharing the same first life testing conditions. These two cells showed a good repeatability in terms of capacity fade and dc internal resistance increase during first life testing, still retaining ca. 97% of their initial capacity and ca. 180% and 150% of dc internal resistance at FL-EOL, respectively. In order to compare the impact of the second life application on the ageing performance of the batteries, the cell C13 was tested in second life according to the power smoothing application profile, whereas the cell C14 was tested in second life according to the residential application profile.\n\nThe cell C13 showed a steady capacity fade evolution during the second life ageing phase. Nevertheless, its dc internal resistance increase trend apparently was accelerated in the final part of first life testing. Such increased ageing behavior continued during second life, and the dc internal resistance rose up to ca. 180% by the end of the third month of testing. Although its remaining capacity was still above 90%, as in the case of the three cells in the heterogeneous stack S3 (see Fig. 8), cell C13 bulged before ending the fourth month of testing, which was again attributed to electrolyte decomposition and subsequent gassing events. Similarly, the cell C14 also started to suffer a significant acceleration in the dc internal resistance increase by the end of the first life testing phase, as shown in Fig. 9(ii). However, such cell performed less FEC than its homologous cell C13 on each month of second life testing, as shown in Fig. 9(i) (the milder conditions on the residential demand response application supposed less FEC performed per month of testing). Cell C14 withstood more than six months of laboratory testing before failing, which represent the cycling equivalent to ca. 4 years of operation in the real residential demand response application.\n\nThe cell C15 was later added to the testing plan to evaluate on what extent cells reaching the ageing knee during the first life phase could experience a slowdown in the ageing trend when reused on a less demanding second life application. Therefore, the cell C15 was subjected to second life testing according to the residential demand response application after being retired from the first life with ca. 75% remaining capacity and ca. 360% dc internal resistance (at FL-EOL). No significant changes in the remaining capacity and dc internal resistance values were recorded from FL-EOL to SL-BOL, due to the short storage time in that transition (ca. 35 days).\n\nAs it can be observed in Fig. 9(ii), the ageing trend seemed to slowdown in the second life application when represented against the testing time. Nevertheless, that was only due to the very small amount of cycles performed on each month of second life testing according to the residential application, compared to the first life testing conditions of cell C5, (see Table I). On the contrary, Fig. 9(i) displays a different picture, showing that the capacity fade and the dc internal resistance increase per performed FEC did not experience any slowdown, and that the accelerated ageing behavior continued despite the milder operation demands in the residential demand response application. Such behavior confirms the irreversibility of the change in the dominant ageing mechanism and the rapid performance fade experienced after reaching the ageing knee, even under mild operating conditions.\n\n\nE. Discussion\n\nThe results in Figs. 6-9 provided dissimilar observations with respect to the technical viability of reusing the selected NMC/C battery reference on the targeted second life applications.\n\nResults from homogeneous stacks S1 and S4 (shown in Fig. 6) and from the heterogeneous stack S2 (shown in Fig. 7) suggested that it might be viable to reuse the selected battery reference on the power smoothing application. All the cells selected performed a significant amount of FEC in the first life, which would represent a significant amount of up to 300 000 km driven in the automotive use phase (with modern EV range values), and still provided a long-lasting second life performance. Yet, all these batteries were retired from first life use while still having a minimum 95% remaining capacity.\n\nThe ageing performance of the cells in Stack S3 showed very limited second life battery lifetime, as it can be observed in Fig. 8. Indeed, all the batteries retired at an advanced ageing stage (either considering the remaining capacity or the dc internal resistance) only lasted few weeks of second life testing before they suddenly swelled.\n\nWith respect to the cells tested at the cell level, Fig. 9 suggested that neither reusing the EV batteries on less demanding second life applications would extend battery lifetime once the ageing evolution starts to accelerate, as it was the case of cells C14 and C15, tested according to the residential demand response application.\n\nOverall, the results obtained contradict the suitability of the 70%-80% remaining capacity threshold as a standard FL-EOL criterion. All the analyzed cells experienced a change in the dominant ageing mechanism before reaching 80% remaining capacity, and most of them even suffered such change in the ageing trend above 90% remaining capacity. Cell C15 proved that reusing the batteries on a mild demanding application does not achieve slowing down the ageing trend, once the ageing knee is reached. Thus, according to the results here presented, the cells experiencing any changes in the dominant ageing mechanism would have to be retired from operation, either on the first or the second life use phases, because of two main reasons: 1) the Ah-throughput (and thus the number of cycles) that these cells can withstand after reaching the ageing knee would be insufficient to make profitable extending their operation; and most importantly, 2) it might be unsafe to maintain such cells in operation. Only the cells not experiencing any changes in the dominant ageing mechanism may be eligible for a second life use. This fact may limit the amount of cells eligible for a potential second life, or even restrict their first life use phase, but it could simplify the second life battery design process. Additionally, since the dominant ageing mechanism would not change before retiring the batteries from operation, there would not be any electrochemical difference in the batteries' ageing phenomena, and hence first life battery lifetime models might be also usable to predict the second life battery ageing performance.\n\nTaking into account the strong influence of the first life battery ageing upon the technical viability of a potential second life use, tracking data of first life battery ageing appears as a key resource for decision making. Indeed, the first life battery ageing data would be crucial to select the most suitable batteries and predict their ageing performance on a potential second life use. Similarly, tracking second life battery ageing turns out to be essential to identify battery failure and avoid any safety events.\n\n\nV. CONCLUSION\n\nThis paper describes the methodology developed to analyze the second life Li-ion battery performance and degradation behavior.\n\nThe study pursued the evaluation of the technical capabilities of retired EV batteries under two different second life applications: 1) a residential demand response management application and 2) a power smoothing application for a grid-scale PV plant. Aiming at a wider approach, batteries retired with different first life ageing histories and at different levels of SOH were considered this paper.\n\nThe suitability of 70%-80% remaining capacity as a standard automotive battery retirement criterion was demonstrated not to be valid. It was also demonstrated that no slowdown in the ageing trend was experienced when reusing the batteries after reaching the ageing knee (i.e., after experiencing a change in the dominant ageing mechanism).\n\nOverall, for the selected NMC/C Li-ion battery reference, only the cells retired from the automotive service while still being on an early degradation stage would provide a long-lasting second life ageing performance. Nevertheless, the first life ageing performance of most of the batteries selected suggests a sufficient performance capability after performing 800 to 1900 FEC during the automotive service. Thus, it would be convenient to consider that the Li-ion batteries in some modern EVs could be at an early degradation stage when being retired after driving ca. 200 000-300 000 km.\n\nIn conclusion, not all the cells may be eligible for a potential second life use, and correctly tracking first life battery ageing data would be crucial to select the most suitable second life batteries. Thereby, the commitment and collaboration of automotive OEMs would be vital for a well-founded battery selection and to make the battery second life a technically viable concept.\n\nThe conclusions derived from the results presented in this paper were only proven for the particular Li-ion cell considered. Most of the conclusions withdrawn for the obtained bat-teries may probably apply for other Li-ion battery references. However, different results could still be obtained for other Li-ion battery chemistries or cell references.\n\nFig. 1 .\n1Block diagram of (a) residential demand response application and (b) power smoothing renewable integration application.\n\nFig. 2 .\n2Methodology for an SLBESS sizing and application profile definition.\n\nFig. 3 .\n3One-month synthesized current profile of the two applications considered: power smoothing application (blue) and residential application (red).\n\nFig. 4 .\n4Block diagram of the transition from first life to second life testing.\n\n3 )\n3Second life beginning of life (SL-BOL), which represents the moment when the batteries are reimplemented on a second life application. 4) Second life end of life (SL-EOL) which reproduces the moment of second life battery retirement.
