Biomarkers may facilitate identification of these responding tumors 3 . Neoadjuvant use of these agents is associated with pathological complete response in a spectrum of tumors, including urothelial cancer 4-7 . Sequential tissue sampling from these studies allowed for detailed on-treatment biomarker analysis. Here, we present a single-arm phase 2 study, investigating two cycles of atezolizumab before cystectomy in 95 patients with muscle-invasive urothelial cancer (ClinicalTrials. gov identifier: NCT02662309). Pathological complete response was the primary endpoint. Secondary endpoints focused on safety, relapse-free survival and biomarker analysis. The pathological complete response rate was 31% (95% confidence interval: 21-41%), achieving the primary efficacy endpoint. Baseline biomarkers showed that the presence of preexisting activated T cells was more prominent than expected and correlated with outcome. Other established biomarkers, such as tumor mutational burden, did not predict outcome, differentiating this from the metastatic setting. Dynamic changes to gene expression signatures and protein biomarkers occurred with therapy, whereas changes in DNA alterations with treatment were uncommon. Responding tumors showed predominant expression of genes related to tissue repair after treatment, making tumor biomarker interpretation challenging in this group. Stromal factors such as transforming growth factor-\u03b2 and fibroblast activation protein were linked to resistance, as was high expression of cell cycle gene signatures after treatment.\n\nCystectomy is the standard of care for patients with muscleinvasive urothelial cancer (UC) of the bladder who are not eligible for neoadjuvant chemotherapy 8 . Outcomes are poor and new treatments are required in this group of patients 9,10 . We investigated this population in a phase 2 study to establish efficacy, safety and biomarker signals. The neoadjuvant setting enabled sequential tissue sampling and the identification of molecular pathways associated with response and relapse. Three biological responses described in the metastatic setting were initially investigated 3 : (1) preexisting CD8 + T cell immunity; (2) transforming growth factor (TGF)-\u03b2, specifically in tumors with an excluded immune phenotype; and (3) tumor mutational burden (TMB) in association with DNA damage repair (DDR) and cell cycle transcriptional signatures. Exploratory analysis of DNA alterations was also performed to identify makers of response and resistance.\n\nBetween May 2016 and June 2018, 95 patients were recruited from 21 sites ( Table 1). The median follow-up was 13.1 months (95% confidence interval (CI): 9.5-13.5 months). Eighty-eight patients were assessable for the primary endpoint (87 patients had cystectomy). Eight patients did not have cystectomy (which in three cases was treatment related; Extended Data Fig. 1). At the time of analysis, 17 patients had relapsed and 17 patients had died (1 postoperative death and 1 treatment-related death). The median time from starting atezolizumab to surgery was 5.6 weeks (interquartile range (IQR): 4-6.9 weeks).\n\nThe study met its primary endpoint with a pathological complete response (pCR) rate of 31% (27/88; 95% CI: 21-41%). The pCR rate in patients previously treated with bacillus Calmette-Gu\u00e9rin\n\n\nClinical efficacy and biomarker analysis of neoadjuvant atezolizumab in operable urothelial carcinoma in the ABACUS trial\n\nLetters Nature MediciNe (BCG; n = 10) was 30% (95% CI: 7-65%), whereas the pCR rate in patients with T3 or T4 disease at baseline was 17% (95% CI: 5-37%; Extended Data Fig. 2). One-year relapse-free survival was 79% (95% CI: 67-87%). Radiological responses (RECIST v.1.1) and progression before surgery occurred in 22% (95% CI: 13-35%) and 16% (95% CI: 7-27%) of cases, respectively (Extended Data Fig. 3).\n\nNo new safety signals were seen, and treatment did not seem to complicate surgery. Overall, 39 of 87 (45%) patients had grade I to II surgical complications (Clavien Dindo classification), including urinary tract infection (26%), paralytic ileus (7%) and anemia (6%). A total of 17% of patients had grade III to IV surgical complications, most commonly wound dehiscence (6%). One patient had surgical complications resulting in postoperative death. Grade 3 or 4 Common Terminology Criteria (CTC) for adverse events (AEs) occurred in 10 of 95 (11%) patients (Supplementary Table 1). AEs that prevented cystectomy (n = 3) included deterioration of performance status, myocardial infarction and pneumonia.\n\nSeven tumors exhibited characteristics of incomplete response with immune infiltration and limited numbers of cancer cells remaining (<10%). Such tumors have been characterized as a major pathological response (MPR) in lung cancer and melanoma but have not been previously described in UC 11,12 (Fig. 1a). We defined them by the presence of >90% necrosis, CD8 + T cells, macrophages and tertiary lymphoid follicles at the central histology review. This biological endpoint is considered important enough in lung cancer to be the primary endpoint in a randomized trial (ClinicalTrials. gov identifier: NCT03800134). Further work in bladder cancer is required.\n\nOverall, 35 of 88 (40%) patients were positive for PD-L1 at baseline, which is higher than expected when compared to the metastatic UC population (234 of 931, 25%) 2 , tested with the same anti-PD-L1 antibody clone (SP142; \u22655% of immune cells). The pCR rate in this population was 37% (95% CI: 21-55%; Fig. 1b), and the 1-year relapse-free survival rate was 75% (95% CI: 53-87%). There was no significant correlation between PD-L1 expression and outcome, on either immune cells (Fig. 1b) or tumor cells (P > 0.05 for both; Extended Data Fig. 4).\n\nPreexisting T cell immunity correlated with response. High presence of intraepithelial CD8 + cells was associated with a pCR rate of 40% (95% CI: 26-57%) compared to a rate of 20% (95% CI: 9-35%) with absence of CD8 (P < 0.05; Fig. 1b). One-year relapsefree survival was 85% (95% CI: 67-94%) for the CD8 + population. A predefined eight-gene cytotoxic T cell transcriptional signature (tGE8) was significantly increased in responders compared to patients with stable disease (P < 0.01) and patients who relapsed 3 (P < 0.01; Fig. 1c).\n\nTumor CD8 + immune phenotypes characterized as inflamed, excluded and desert have been previously described in metastatic UC 3 . Excluded tumors are characterized by prominent stromal components, including fibroblasts and collagen 3,13 . Inflamed and desert phenotypes have been linked with response and resistance to atezolizumab, respectively. We observed a higher-than-expected occurrence of T cell-inflamed tumors compared to the metastatic setting (73% versus 26%; Fig. 1d) 3 . The inflamed immune phenotype did not correlate with response owing largely to the high prevalence of this phenotype across all tumors. We therefore explored the quality of the immune infiltrate with dual CD8 and granzyme B (GZMB) staining. GZMB is an essential mediator in lymphocyte activity and is used as a surrogate marker of activated CD8 + cells 14 . We showed that cells dually stained for CD8 and GZMB were expressed in responding tumors with an inflamed phenotype (14 of 16, 87%), unlike in relapsing inflamed tumors, which showed low levels of CD8 + and GZMB + cells (3 of 10, 30%; P < 0.05; Fig. 1d). This is a notable finding. It shows that the quality of the immune infiltrate, beyond CD8 expression, is relevant in determining outcome.\n\nPrevious work in metastatic UC demonstrated that TGF-\u03b2 drives resistance in the excluded immune phenotype by active T cell exclusion 3 . We reproduced these results in the neoadjuvant setting, broadening the relevance of previous observations (Fig. 1e). The desert immune phenotype was not associated with response in this setting and alternative treatment approaches should be pursued 3 .\n\nWe next explored tumor-intrinsic factors such as TMB together with DDR and cell cycle genes 15 . The baseline median TMB was 10.09 mutations per Mb (95% CI: 3.78-42.87 mutations per Mb), similar to the 9.65 mutations per Mb observed in the metastatic setting 2 (Fig. 1g). The pCR rate was not increased in TMB-high (\u226510 mutations per Mb; 31%) tumors (Fig. 1h). Expression of genes in the cell cycle regulation pathway 3 and mutations in DDR genes also failed to correlate with outcome (Fig. 1f,i and Extended Data Fig. 5). Inconsistencies in the makeup of different DDR signatures prohibited any cross-trial comparison 16 . \n\n\nLetters\n\n\nNature MediciNe\n\nWe next explored the effect of treatment on biomarker expression and observed a significant increase in intraepithelial CD8 expression (78% increase in median values; Fig. 2a,b). Treatment was also associated with an increase in PD-L1, fibroblast activation protein (FAP), and CD8 and GZMB expression (P < 0.05 for each; Fig. 2b). Positive pairwise correlations between these biomarkers were observed, except for the FAP-CD8 pairing (Extended Data Fig. 6).\n\nChanges in immunohistochemistry (IHC) biomarkers were then correlated with outcome. An increase in intraepithelial CD8 levels occurred in responding tumors, which was not the case in relapsing tumors (P < 0.01). FAP expression remained high in relapsing tumors, whereas a decrease was seen in responders (P < 0.01; Fig. 2c). FAP plays an important role in immune resistance in the tumor microenvironment by recruiting inhibitory immune populations such as regulatory T cells and subsets of myeloid cells 17,18 . FAP is a surrogate marker for cancer-associated fibroblasts, which are present in the tumor microenvironment and associated with TGF-\u03b2 and poor outcome 17 . FAP expression was linked to resistance to therapy, highlighting the importance of stromal components in determining outcome. This, along with the GZMB data, may explain why many inflamed tumors do not respond to therapy.\n\nDynamic changes to immune phenotypes occurred with therapy in 9 of 50 (18%) patients with treatment (5 patients changed from an excluded to an inflamed phenotype and 4 patients changed from an inflamed to an excluded phenotype; Extended Data Fig. 7). The excluded immune phenotype was rare in relapsed patients (n = 2), limiting our ability to assess the relevance of stromal TGF-\u03b2 signals in nonresponder groups after treatment.\n\nDistinct molecular groups have been defined by the Lund taxonomy and correlate with outcome to atezolizumab treatment in metastatic UC 19 . The genomic unstable group, with high mutational burden correlated with response in metastatic disease, potentially giving the classification clinical relevance. In the neoadjuvant setting, the genomic unstable group did not correlate with outcome. Also, we found that most tumors (41 of 64, 64.1%) changed taxonomy staining. The second row shows MPR, defined as 10% or less of residual viable tumor cells of the removed primary tumor and dense CD8 + cell and macrophage infiltration, as well as numerous tertiary lymphoid follicles. Iimmune cells encircling residual tumor can be seen. The tumor bed region of patients with MPR was recognized by an anatomic pathologist in paraffin blocks of the cystectomy specimen. Cut sections were stained once with H&E and once for PanCK-CD8. b, Percentage pCR (left) and time to relapse or cancer-related death (right) for patients stratified by baseline PD-L1 status (top) and intraepithelial CD8 + cell expression (bottom). Tumors were defined as PD-L1 + if \u22655% of immune cells (ICs) showed staining with the SP142 antibody 13 ; tumors were identified as CD8 + if the number of CD8 + cells (density per mm 3 of tumor) was above the median of 186.25. All patients were included in the relapse-free survival analysis (Kaplan-Meier; RECIST v.1.1). Not all patients had surgery for pCR assessment, which accounts for the discrepancies between the two plots.\n\nOne-year relapse-free survival for the PD-L1 + population and CD8-high population was 75% (95% CI: 53-87%) and 85% (95% CI: 67-94%), respectively. Comparisons between subgroups were performed using two-sided Pearson's chi-squared test. No adjustments were made for multiple comparisons. c, tGE8 gene signature expression at baseline for patients stratified by clinical outcome. tGE8 is a transcriptional signature of eight genes (IFNG, CXCL9, CD8A, GZMA, GZMB, CXCL10, PRF1 and TBX21) described previously in locally advanced or metastatic UC 3 that represents interferon signaling and presence of CD8 + effector T cells. The signature z score is calculated as the median of the z score for each gene from the signature. In the box plots, the horizontal bold line represents the median. The lower and upper hinges of the box correspond to the first and third quartiles (the 25th and 75th percentiles); the upper whisker extends from the hinge to the largest value no further than 1.5 \u00d7 IQR from the hinge (where IQR is the distance between the first and third quartiles); and the lower whisker extends from the hinge to the smallest value at most 1.5 \u00d7 IQR from the hinge. P values were calculated using the two-sided Wilcoxon rank-sum test. No adjustments were made for multiple comparisons. The number of patients is given in parentheses. SD, stable disease. d, Distribution of CD8 + immune phenotypes at baseline stratified by clinical outcome group. Immune phenotypes were assessed centrally by two pathologists using established methods 15 . Overall, 72 baseline samples were assessed. A high prevalence of the inflamed phenotype at baseline was observed in this cohort (inflamed, 73%; excluded, 19%; desert, 8%). There was a predominance of inflamed tumors, unlike in the metastatic setting 2 . No clear correlation between phenotype and response was apparent. Inflamed tumors were split into two groups with high and low dual staining for CD8 and GZMB. There was a significant correlation (Pearson's chi-squared test, P = 0.004) between presence of CD8 + GZMB + cells and response in inflamed tumors, unlike in relapsing tumors, which showed low levels of CD8 + GZMB + cells. No adjustments were made for multiple comparisons. The number of patients is given in the bars. e, Association between clinical outcome and expression of TGF-\u03b2-induced genes (pan-TGF-\u03b2 responsive signature, TBRS) at baseline for patients stratified by immune phenotype. The TBRS includes 19 genes induced by TGF-\u03b2 identified by in vitro experiments 3 . Left, at baseline, the pan-TBRS exhibited a statistically nonsignificant trend for increased expression in tumors with the excluded immune phenotype from patients who relapsed (n = 2). These data support previous results in metastatic UC 3 . Right, the combination of tGE8 and TBRS correlated with immune phenotype and response to treatment. P values were calculated using the two-sided Wilcoxon rank-sum test. No adjustments were made for multiple comparisons. The number of patients is given in parentheses. NS, not significant. Box plots are as described in c. f, Reactome analysis comparing tumors at baseline from responders and patients who relapsed. The top gene sets associated with response or relapse are displayed. Association with the cell cycle signature (MKI67, CCNE1, BUB1, BUB1B, CCNB2, CDC25C, CDK2, MCM4, MCM6, MCM2) was not significant 15 . Enrichment analysis was conducted using the hypergeometric test with Benjamini-Hochberg false discovery rate (FDR) adjustment (Bioconductor package ReactomePA). Patient numbers are given in parentheses. g, Relationship of TMB at baseline with outcome. Total TMB was estimated using the Foundation One method 2 as previously described in UC. No correlation was observed between TMB and response to treatment. P values were calculated using the two-sided Wilcoxon rank-sum test. No adjustments were made for multiple comparisons. The number of patients is given in parentheses. Box plots are as described in c. h, Percentage pCR (left) and time to relapse or cancer-related death (right) for patients stratified by TMB, using the median (10.1 mutations per Mb) as the cutoff. No significant correlation was seen. One-year relapse-free survival for the TMB-high population was 75% (95% CI: 57-86%). Comparisons between subgroups were performed using two-sided Pearson's chi-squared test. No adjustments were made for multiple comparisons. i, Alteration status in DDR-related genes was observed at baseline for patients stratified by outcome. No significant difference (Pearson's chi-squared test, P = 0.27) in DDR mutation signature was seen between outcome groups. Only 26 genes had detectable alterations in at least one sample. Patient numbers are given in the bars. WT, wild type; Mut., mutated.  \n\n\nLetters\n\n\nNature MediciNe\n\nThe Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) subtypes, these data show consistent changes in responding tumors focusing on host-dominated tissue repair 20 . This has implications for future research, in that responding samples after treatment seem to reflect host rather than tumor tissue. Because of these limitations, we compared the transcriptional and DNA profiles of stable disease and relapsed tumors in the treated samples (excluding responding patients). Treatment did not have a significant effect on TMB, suggesting that the twocycle treatment course was too short to promote expansion of resistant somatically mutated tumor clones. TMB and DDR alterations in treated samples did not predict relapse (Fig. 2f). However, expression of genes related to proliferation and cell cycle in treated samples was associated with relapse (P = 0.02; Fig. 2g,h). Speculation surrounding a link between cell cycle and proliferation genes and outcome has been proposed in glioblastoma 6 . This is an avenue for further research and novel therapeutic combinations in the future (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT01676753). Upregulation of cell cycle genes could represent more aggressive tumor phenotypes. Alternatively, preclinical data suggest that cell cycle gene over expression may enhance the presence of resistant immune cells, highlighting a possible mechanism of immune escape 21 . Exploratory mutation analysis identified increased amplification of FGF3, FGF19 and CCND1, which are on the same locus (11q13.3), in responding tumors (Fig. 3a). Drugs targeting fibroblast growth factor (FGF) signaling have recently been approved in UC by the US Food and Drug Administration 22 . This association between FGF gene alterations and response has not been well described; indeed, it contradicts previous speculation from TCGA analysis 13 . Combination trials targeting PD-L1 and cell cycle genes are justified. Consistent DNA alterations were not observed between preand post-treatment samples, suggesting stability rather than rapid clonal evolution during this short period on therapy (Fig. 3b). This is consistent with our TMB data. In view of this, treated tissue was not correlated with outcome. Previous data in the neoadjuvant area are inconsistent. This may be driven by relatively small numbers in previous studies as well as different agents or duration of therapy 5,12 . Finally, we compared gene expression before and after treatment in tumors that were stable with therapy. Stable disease samples were selected to minimize the effect of the host response on expression, as seen in responding patients (Fig. 3c,d). Results showed increased immune signatures associated with therapy, consistent with the mechanism of action of therapy.\n\nPrevious studies in the metastatic setting have attempted to combine biomarkers to improve patient selection, for example, using high TMB and high T effector numbers 3,13,15 . We performed exploratory analysis with combinations of biomarkers in an attempt to enrich for responses. Specifically, we investigated the tGE8 signature described in Fig. 1c with either TMB or CD8 and GZMB expression (Fig. 3e,f). Results showed that dual expression of CD8 and GZMB together with tGE8 (n = 25) was associated with a 40% response rate and 4% relapse rate. No enrichment was seen in the TMB-tGE8 combination. The arrow indicates increased FAP expression after treatment. Bottom, a tumor whose phenotype changed from excluded to inflamed. Arrows indicate the increased number of CD8 + cells. No increase in FAP was seen. This patient achieved stable disease with therapy. Cut sections were stained for each biomarker. b, Expression of the three biomarkers by IHC before and after therapy. Biomarker analysis analysis was performed for patients from whom paired biopsies were available (the number of paired tumor samples is given in parentheses). The discrepancy in the number of samples analyzed stems from the fact that patients with pCR did not in all cases have sufficient tumor tissue for exhaustive biomarker analysis. Results show increased expression of all three biomarkers with treatment. Samples were obtained from TURBT before treatment (Pre) and from cystectomy after treatment (Post). Units of measurement are as follows: PD-L1, IC (%) positive; FAP, area stained for high FAP in the tumor region divided by the area of the tumor region (%); PanCK-CD8, number of CD8 + cell objects in the intraepithelial compartment divided by the total area of the intraepithelial compartment (number per mm\u00b2). P values were calculated using the two-sided Wilcoxon rank-sum test, with no multiple testing between responders and relapsed patients. In the box plots, the horizontal bold line represents the median; the lower and upper hinges of the box correspond to the first and third quartiles (the 25th and 75th percentiles); the upper whisker extends from the hinge to the largest value no further than 1.5 \u00d7 IQR from the hinge; and the lower whisker extends from the hinge to the smallest value at most 1.5 \u00d7 IQR from the hinge. c, CD8, PD-L1 and FAP expression in responding and relapsing tumors before and after therapy. Biomarker analysis was performed for patients from whom paired biopsies were available (the number of paired tumor samples is given in parentheses). Analysis of responders focused on patients with MPR. Relapsing patients were either patients with radiological relapse (RECIST v.1.1) or patients who died of any cause. Statistical analysis included two-sided Wilcoxon matched-pairs signed-rank test to compare baseline and cystectomy samples and two-sided Wilcoxon rank-sum tests to compare samples from progressors and responders. No multiple testing was performed between patients who responded and relapsed. Results showed increased CD8 levels in responders while FAP increased in patients who relapsed. Box plots are as described in b. d, Association between Lund molecular taxonomy subtypes and response to treatment 19 . Baseline (left) and post-treatment (right) samples were analyzed by response to treatment. Changes to the molecular subgroup occurred in the majority of patients. Responding patients showed a significant increase in the infiltrated group (Pearson's chi-squared test, P = 0.013) with a reduction in all other types. Patients with stable disease showed a less marked increase in the infiltrated type. No apparent difference occurred with the relapsed group. Analysis of patients with pCR included tissue from the tumor bed as no viable cancer cells were apparent. Responding patients (MPR and pCR) showed features of tissue repair within the infiltrated subgroup. Patient numbers are given in the bars. GU, genomically unstable; Inf, infiltrated; SCCL, squamous cell carcinoma-like; UroA, urothelial-like A; UroB, urothelial-like B. e, Reactome analysis of differentially expressed genes between pre-and post-treatment samples for all response groups combined. The top ten enriched pathways post-treatment (red) and pretreatment (blue) were selected for display on the bar chart. PD-L1 blockade broadly associates with increases in stromal signatures (extracellular matrix and collagens) and decreases in the proliferation signature. P values are given on the x axis. Enrichment analysis was conducted using the hypergeometric test with Benjamini-Hochberg FDR adjustment (Bioconductor package ReactomePA). f, Correlation between TMB and treatment by outcome in pre-and post-treatment samples. Treatment was not associated with any significant change in TMB, regardless of outcome group. TMB could not be assessed in responders as tumor DNA was absent. Numbers of samples are given in parentheses. The two-sided Wilcoxon rank-sum test was used for comparisons. No adjustments were made for multiple comparisons. g,h, Volcano plot (g) and Reactome gene signature analysis (h) for individual genes or gene signatures correlating with progression versus stable disease in treated samples. The volcano plot highlights cell cycle genes associated with relapse and collagen and repair genes associated with response. A linear model was fitted to the outcome variable (R package limma), with a contrast comparing post-treatment samples from patients with stable disease and relapse. The nominal (non-adjusted) P value is reported. The Reactome plot shows significantly increased cell cycle signatures associated with relapse (MKI67, CCNE1, BUB1,  BUB1B, CCNB2, CDC25C, CDK2, MCM4, MCM6, MCM2). Enrichment analysis was conducted using the hypergeometric test with Benjamini-Hochberg FDR adjustment (Bioconductor package ReactomePA). Numbers of samples are given in parentheses.\n\n\nLetters\n\n\nNature MediciNe\n\nThere are currently no perioperative systemic treatments recommended for operable muscle-invasive UC not eligible for neoadjuvant chemotherapy, despite high cancer-related mortality. Therefore, the significant activity shown here with atezolizumab is clinically relevant. Validation of pCR and MPR as a surrogate marker of outcome for immune-checkpoint inhibitors is required. In our study only 2 of 29 patients with pCR or MPR have relapsed.\n\nBiomarker results from tissue taken before starting therapy showed that two of the three previously identified pathways associated with outcome remain relevant 3 . Higher-than-expected preexisting T cell immunity seems to be the driving factor accounting for the higher-than-expected response rates. This seems to be a major discriminating feature between this neoadjuvant setting and the metastatic setting [1][2][3] . The quality of the immune infiltrate is relevant      5,7 . These neoadjuvant studies employed different drugs for different durations across a spectrum of tumor types, which may at least partly account for the inconsistencies. In these settings, T cell biomarkers may be preferable to existing biomarkers in predicting response, especially when used in combination (CD8-GZMB) and require testing in ongoing randomized trials (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT03732677).\n\nOur trial reported biomarker analysis on over 60 paired samples with outcome data, which is more robust than previous neoadjuvant series across four tumor types [5][6][7]11,12 . Tissue in this study was taken at a specific time point and treatment was given for a specific duration, which may have influenced the results. Our work highlights the difficultly in assessing response biomarkers after treatment due to the limited amount of cancer tissue available, as a result of response. Host and tissue repair factors dominate instead of cancer signatures, rendering RNA molecular classifications, such as the Lund classification, challenging in treated samples.\n\nAlternative analysis of treated tissue may be required. This requires consideration in future studies. A high proportion of patients had node-positive disease and the relapse rate at 1 year was 21%, suggesting that adjuvant therapy is required to maximize outcomes. Results from 1-year adjuvant treatment with atezolizumab are awaited (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT03024996).\n\nOur findings directly contrast with those seen with atezolizumab in metastatic chemotherapy-resistant UC 2,13,15 . This reversal of biomarker relevance implies that the performance of these markers with anti-PD-L1 treatment is dependent on the clinical setting in UC. TCGA data along with our gene expression data and DNA analysis demonstrate changes in the biology of UC with more advanced disease 16,23 . We speculate that different treatment and biomarker approaches will be required to maximize outcomes in different clinical settings. The biomarkers identified here, especially from posttreatment tissue, may facilitate patient selection and give a better understanding of the biology of the disease.\n\n\nOnline content\n\nAny methods, additional references, Nature Research reporting summaries, source data, extended data, supplementary information, acknowledgements, peer review information; details of author contributions and competing interests; and statements of data and code availability are available at https://doi.org/10.1038/s41591-019-0628-7.\n\n\nFig. 3 | exploratory analysis of DNA alterations and RNA and protein expression.\n\nThis analysis was performed to investigate areas outside of the three biological pathways described in Figs. 1 and 2. These data should be interpreted with caution in view of their exploratory and unvalidated nature. a, Oncoprint representing known DNA alterations from baseline tissue associated with response to neoadjuvant atezolizumab therapy. Significance was assessed by Pearson's chi-squared test (P < 0.001), with alterations in eight genes demonstrating an association with response, stable disease or relapse. Five genes were specifically altered in responders, including ERBB3, FGF4, FGF19, CCND1 and FGF3. FGFR4, FGFR19, CCND1 and FGF3 (associated with response) were co-amplified as they are on the same locus at 11q13.3. FGF2 and FGF3 receptor targeting has efficacy in UC. Combinations with immune therapy are therefore justified 24 . Numbers of tumor samples are given in parentheses. b, Oncoprint showing alterations before and after two cycles of therapy in patients with stable disease or relapse. Responding patients were not included owing to absence or limited amount of cancer tissue in their samples. No consistent alterations occurred with therapy. Paired samples showed similar profiles. This suggests that treatment outcome is not linked to expansion or shrinkage of specific cancer clones. c, Volcano plots depicting differentially expressed genes between pre-and post-treatment samples in patients with stable disease. Genes are colored in red (log(FC) \u2265 0.25) or blue (log(FC) \u2264 \u22120.25) if FDR P < 0.05. Comparative analysis was performed in this stable population because it was not influenced by the effects of response or relapse on gene expression. Immune genes that were upregulated are highlighted. A linear model was fitted to the visit variable for patients with stable disease (R package limma), with a contrast comparing post-and pretreatment samples. The nominal (non-adjusted) P value was reported on the y axis. d, Bar chart representing geneset enrichment from Reactome in pretreatment (blue) and post-treatment (red) samples in individuals with stable disease. Tumors from responders and patients who relapsed were excluded to reduce the influence of the tumor on gene expression. By excluding these tumors, the data shown most likely represent the influence of the drug on the tumor. The top 15 gene sets enriched in pre-or post-treatment samples are represented. A number of immune-related genes were upregulated. P values are given on the x axis. Enrichment analysis was conducted using the hypergeometric test with Benjamini-Hochberg FDR adjustment (Bioconductor package ReactomePA). e, Outcome of patients with high expression of the T effector gene signature described in Fig. 1c and dual CD8 and GZMB positivity. Enrichment for responders (40%) and low relapse rates (4%) can be seen. P values are not given owing to the exploratory nature of the analysis. f, Outcome of tumors with both high T effector signature (gene expression) and high TMB. Pretreated tissue was taken for analysis. For both markers, high levels were defined as values above the median. No enrichment in response was seen with the addition of TMB. Previous data in the metastatic setting show that these two parameters are enriched for response 3,13,14 .\n\n\nLetters\n\n\nNature MediciNe\n\n\nMethods\n\n\nTrial design and patient population.\n\nThis is an open-label, international, multicenter, single-arm, neoadjuvant phase 2 trial evaluating the effects of two cycles (1,200 mg, three times weekly) of preoperative atezolizumab in patients with histologically confirmed (T2-T4aN0M0) transitional cell UC of the bladder, awaiting planned radical cystectomy. Additional eligibility criteria included residual disease after TURBT, adequate fitness for planned cystectomy (according to local guidelines), ineligibility for or refusal of cisplatin-based neoadjuvant chemotherapy, no evidence of nodal or metastatic disease on cross-sectional imaging, ECOG performance status of 0 or 1, and adequate hematologic and end-organ function within 4 weeks of the first study treatment. Major exclusion criteria included evidence of significant uncontrolled concomitant disease that could affect compliance with the protocol or interpretation of results, previous autoimmune disease, ongoing active infections or prior use of immune checkpoint inhibitors. All patients provided written informed consent. The relevant institutional review board or ethics committee for each participating center approved the study, which was conducted in accordance with the principles of Good Clinical Practice, the provisions of the Declaration of Helsinki and other applicable local regulations. The study was sponsored by Queen Mary University of London, UK (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT02662309). The Barts Experimental Cancer Centre Clinical Trials Group had overall responsibility for trial management; the trial management group was responsible for day-to-day running of the trial and the trial was overseen by an independent data monitoring committee. Emerging safety data were reviewed regularly by the independent data monitoring committee. The study received regulatory approval in November 2015. Patients were enrolled between May 2016 and June 2018. The clinical data cut for analysis occurred in December 2018.\n\nClinical endpoints and statistical considerations. The pCR rate (investigator assessed) was selected as the primary efficacy endpoint. Efficacy analysis for the pCR rate included all patients who met the eligibility criteria, had at least one cycle of atezolizumab and underwent cystectomy or withdrew for progression of disease. pCR was defined as pT0 and in situ cancer on the basis of histological evaluation of the TURBT and cystectomy samples by local institutional analysis. A pCR of \u226520% supported further investigation while the pCR should not have been \u226410%. A'Hern's single-stage design 25 was used to yield a sample size of 78 patients (80% power and one-sided test of significance at the 5% level). To allow for withdrawal of consent, and possible dropouts or patients who did not undergo cystectomy, the intention was to recruit approximately 85 assessable patients. Sample size calculations were performed using the software package PASS v.12.0.\n\nSecondary endpoints included the pCR rate in patients who were positive for PD-L1. The standard definition of PD-L1 positivity for atezolizumab in bladder cancer was used (\u22655% of immune cells staining using the SP142 antibody, Ventana 11 ). The response rate was evaluated on cross-sectional imaging by RECIST v.1.1. AEs graded according to CTCAE v.4.03 were collected during treatment and up to 24 weeks post-cystectomy. Surgical complications were assessed using the Clavien Dindo classification up to 4 weeks post-cystectomy. Safety analysis, response rate and relapse-free survival are presented for all patients who met the eligibility criteria and received the study drug. Relapse-free survival is a discriminatory endpoint and the primary endpoint of most randomized trials. pCR remains attractive in the short term but has not been validated with immune oncology drugs in UC.\n\nAll clinical efficacy endpoints were analyzed using STATA v.13.1. The Kaplan-Meier method was used to measure the time to disease recurrence. The definition of relapsed included radiological or clinical relapse. A Wilcoxon rank-sum test was used to compare changes in biomarkers before and after therapy. Correlations were measured by Pearson product-moment correlation coefficient. All IHC protein tests were performed in R software.\n\nCentral pathology review and protein analysis. A central pathology review of PanCK-CD8 and PD-L1 occurred in all patients who had available tumor tissue at baseline (92) and cystectomy (84) (Extended Data Fig. 1). Not all patients had all pre-and post-treatment biomarkers measured owing to a lack of tumor tissue availability in pCR samples. PD-L1 and PanCK-CD8 were initially prioritized. Immune phenotype (inflamed, desert and excluded) samples were assessed by two trained histopathologists in 78 baseline and 57 post-treatment samples (scored on the PanCK-CD8) 3 . Antibodies to PD-L1 (SP142), PanCK (AE1/AE3/PCK26), CD8 (SP239), GZMB (EPR8260) and FAP (SP325) were used for biomarker analysis with established methods on the Ventana BenchmarkR ULTRA and Ventana BenchmarkR XT platform.\n\nPanCK-CD8, CD8-GZMB and FAP were scored via a quantitative method using the image analysis software VisiopharmR in the total tumor area. Low, medium and high FAP expression was measured in the tumor stroma area. PD-L1, PanCK-CD8, FAP and CD8-GZMB levels above and below the median were compared. In the PanCK-CD8 analysis, the values of CD8 + cells within the cytokeratin-positive tumor strands were used. MPR with immune checkpoint inhibitors has been described previously 11 . Features included immune and macrophage infiltration, tumor necrosis and neovascularization. The characteristics of MPR in muscle-invasive UC of the bladder were assessed in this study.\n\nRNA sample procurement and processing. Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue was macro-dissected for tumor area using H&E staining as a guide. RNA was extracted using the High Pure FFPET RNA Isolation kit (Roche) and assessed by Qubit and Agilent Bioanalyzer for quantity and quality. First-strand cDNA synthesis was primed from total RNA using random primers, followed by the generation of second-strand cDNA with dUTP in place of dTTP in the master mix to facilitate preservation of strand information. Libraries were enriched for the mRNA fraction by positive selection using a cocktail of biotinylated oligonucleotides corresponding to coding regions of the genome. Libraries were sequenced using Illumina sequencing-by-synthesis.\n\nRNA-seq data generation and processing. Raw RNA-seq counts were obtained from Genentech's internal stranded count pipeline. Raw counts were adjusted for gene length using transcript-per-million normalization and subsequent log 2 transformation.\n\nDNA sample procurement. FFPE tissue was macro-dissected for tumor area using H&E staining as a guide. DNA was extracted using KingFisher (Thermo Scientific) and analyzed at Foundation Medicine using the FoundationOneCDx assay. Genomic analyses, including of TMB, were performed by Foundation Medicine.\n\nDNA somatic mutation data. Comprehensive genomic profiling was carried out in a Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments-certified, College of American Pathologists-accredited laboratory (Foundation Medicine) on allcomers during the course of routine clinical care. Approval was obtained from the Western Institutional Review Board (protocol no. 20152817). Hybrid capture was carried out for all coding exons from up to 395 cancer-related genes plus select introns from up to 31 genes frequently rearranged in cancer. We assessed all classes of genomic alterations, including short variant, copy number (CN) and rearrangement alterations, as described previously. Biallelic (CN = 0) CN loss was called as previously described. Shallow CN loss (CN = 1) was called using similar methodology to arm-level calling. Normalized coverage data for exonic, intronic and single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) targets accounting for stromal admixture were plotted on a logarithmic scale, and minor allele frequencies for SNPs were concordantly plotted. Custom circular binary segmentation further clustered targets and the minor allele frequencies of SNPs to define the upper and lower bounds of genomic segments. Signal-to-noise ratios for each segment were used to determine whether the segment was gained or lost. The sum of the segment sizes determined the fraction of each segment gained or lost. \n\n\nStatistics\n\nFor all statistical analyses, confirm that the following items are present in the figure legend, table legend, main text, or Methods section.\n\n\nn/a Confirmed\n\nThe exact sample size (n) for each experimental group/condition, given as a discrete number and unit of measurement A statement on whether measurements were taken from distinct samples or whether the same sample was measured repeatedly\n\nThe statistical test(s) used AND whether they are one-or two-sided Only common tests should be described solely by name; describe more complex techniques in the Methods section.\n\nA description of all covariates tested A description of any assumptions or corrections, such as tests of normality and adjustment for multiple comparisons A full description of the statistical parameters including central tendency (e.g. means) or other basic estimates (e.g. regression coefficient) AND variation (e.g. standard deviation) or associated estimates of uncertainty (e.g. confidence intervals)\n\nFor null hypothesis testing, the test statistic (e.g. F, t, r) with confidence intervals, effect sizes, degrees of freedom and P value noted \n\n\nSoftware and code\n\nPolicy information about availability of computer code\n\n\nData collection\n\nAll clinical data were collected on an in-house built Electronic Case Report Form (eCRF) designed using ORACLE v11.2.0.

The clinical primary endpoint for this study was efficacy as assessed by pathological complete response rate (pCRR) and was based on the percentage of patients who obtained a pathological complete response at one-sided level of 95% confidence interval. The biological primary endpoint investigated changes in the levels of intra-epithelial CD8 with therapy.\n\nSecondary endpoints included: -Radiological response (RR), which was assessed in patients with measurable disease at baseline (a tumour diameter of >10mm) who received at least one cycle of atezolizumab and had a pre-cystectomy scan regardless of whether they were later found to be ineligible or a protocol violator. RR was based on the Investigator's assessment. Patients without a post-baseline tumour assessment were considered to be non-responders. An estimate of the response rate at one-sided level of 95% confidence intervals was calculated.\n\n-pCRR and radiological response analysis were carried out in the subset of patients with PD-L1 positive bladder cancer.\n\n-Relapse Free Survival (RFS) was defined as the time from enrollment to the first evidence of relapse or death from any cause, whichever occurred first. Relapse was determined on the basis of Investigator assessment as per normal clinical practice with the use of radiological assessments. The Kaplan-Meier method was used to estimate median RFS and the RFS curve was presented together with an estimate of the median DFS at one-sided level of 95% confidence interval. Patients with no post-baseline\n\nFig. 1 |\n1Analysis of three response biologies at baseline. Longitudinal tumor samples were obtained at baseline (transurethral resection of the bladder, TURBT) and after completion of two cycles of neoadjuvant treatment with atezolizumab and undergoing radical cystectomy. The tumor molecular and immune microenvironment was compared on baseline tissue between responders (patients achieving pCR and MPR on histopathological review), patients with stable disease and patients presenting with relapsed or metastatic disease (assessed clinically or on subsequent imaging). a, Representative images of cystectomy samples showing pCR and MPR after neoadjuvant treatment. The first row shows pCR, characterized by the absence of tumor cells and the presence of areas of necrosis surrounded by CD8 + cells, with H&E (left) or pan-cytokeratin (PanCK)-CD8 (versus cytokeratin; right)\n\n\n15, 93.3%) were classified as 'infiltrated' , with increased immune infiltrate, angiogenesis and stromal gene signatures together with decreased cell cycle and DDR signatures. Further gene expression analysis in responding tumors (pCR and MPR) showed similar patterns with high expression of extracellular matrix and collagen formation signatures(Fig. 2e). Therefore, the post-treatment transcriptome of responding tumors reflects tumor microenvironment reorganization with reduced expression of tumor-related genes.

If you are not sure, read the appropriate sections before making your selection.Life sciences Behavioural & social sciences Ecological, evolutionary & environmental sciencesFor a reference copy of the document with all sections, see nature.com/documents/nr-reporting-summary-flat.pdfLife sciences study designAll studies must disclose on these points even when the disclosure is negative.Sample sizeA'Hern's single-stage procedure is used to estimate the number of patients required.Data exclusions The primary efficacy endpoint of pCR included all patients that had cystectomy, including any patients that had disease progression prior to surgery as pre-specified in the study protocol (see extended data figure 1). DNA analysis was not possible on pCR patients as there was no tumor present in the cystectomy sample (see figure 2f-h and 3b). Response and relapse tumors were excluded to reduce tumor influences on gene expression as shown on previous data (see figure 2e and 3d). By excluding these tumors, data shown most likely represent drug influence on tumor.Replication ABACUS trial is a unique data set and no attempt for replication was made; however, relevant papers supporting the clinical findings were cited in our manuscript.Randomization This is phase II clinical trial with no randomization. Subjects were enrolled by clearly defined inclusion and exclusion criteria with baseline characteristics presented in table 1. Univariate analysis was used for determination of relapse-free survival.BlindingNo blinding was performed as it is not ethical to give neoadjuvant placebo therapy and thereby postponing active surgical treatment. Hence, all subjects received the same treatment. All investigators and collaborators were blinded to clinical results when performing measurements and assays.Reporting for specific materials, systems and methodsWe require information from authors about some types of materials, experimental systems and methods used in many studies.

Antibodies are tested on reference samples; Tonsil for PD-L1, CD8 and GZMB, liver for PanCK and lung, liver, breast and colon carcinoma for FAP. The accuracy and specificity was checked via tissue and cell specific expression pattern and in cellular compartment for each stain. Linearity experiments of CD8-GZMB and FAP were performed on serial FFPE sections of the reference samples. For PD-L1, the protocol of the kit insert was used and the antibody dispenser was ready-to-use, no dilution series for linearity experiments were performed. The PanCK pre-diluted primary antibody from Ventana was used and therefore no linearity was performed. For the negative control experiments, a rabbit monoclonal negative control Ig or isotype antibody was used for all immune stains and showed no immuno-reactive staining on the 5 tissue blocks. Precision experiments were done via a white paper test on multiple serial slides of different blocks. Ventana Benchmark\u00ae Ultra and XT were the instruments used in the IHC processes and were qualified.

In total, 87 patients underwent radical cystectomy, 7 patients did not undergo surgery and one patient withdrew consent from the study. 88 patients were assessable for the primary efficacy endpoint analysis, including one patient who experienced progression of disease.Fig. 2| Change in T and N stage associated with therapy. T and N stage at baseline was assessed with pathology samples from TURBT and cross-sectional imaging. T and N stage at surgery was assessed with pathology results from cystectomy and lymphadenectomy (n = 88). Direct comparisons between time points should be avoided due to differences in methodologies of assessment. Baseline nodal staging was radiological while it was pathological at surgery which may account for discrepancies.Fig. 3| Change in the size of bladder mass on imaging. Imaging occurred at baseline and after completion of treatment prior to planned surgery. All patients were included irrespective if they were fit for surgery. Due to definitions of measurable disease not all bladder tumors were measurable at baseline. RECIST v1.1 was used to define response. A positive change denotes an increase in tumor size over time and conversely a negative change denotes a decrease in tumor size over time. Reference lines have been added for response (-30% reduction in tumor size) and progression (20% increase in tumor size). 58 of the 95 treated patients had sequential imaging and radiologically measurable disease at baseline. Radiological progression = 9/58 = 16% (7-27). Radiological response 13/58 = 22% (13-35). 12 patients exhibited no change in their tumor, were not evaluable at pre-cystectomy scan, handled as <10 mm at baseline, and therefore not included in this plot.Extended DataExtended DataExtended Data\nA review on the evolution of PD-1/PD-L1 immunotherapy for bladder cancer: the future is now.
