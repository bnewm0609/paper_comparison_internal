When we talk about the \u201cADAS system\u201d, we mean the devices and sensors having the precise objective of improving and making car driving safer, and among which it is worth mentioning rain sensors, the twilight sensor, adaptive cruise control, automatic emergency braking, parking sensors, automatic signal recognition, and so on. All these devices and sensors are installed on the new homologated cars to minimize the risk of an accident and make life on board of the car easier. Some sensors evaluate the movement and the opening of the eyes, the position of the head and its angle, or some physiological signals of the driver obtainable from the palm of the hands placed in the steering. In the present contribution, the authors will present an innovative recognition and monitoring system of the driver\u2019s attention level through the study of the photoplethysmographic (PPG) signal detectable from the palm of the driver\u2019s hands through special devices housed in the steering of the car. Through a particular and innovative post-processing algorithm of the PPG signal through a hyper-filtering framework, then processed by a machine learning framework, the entire pipeline proposed will be able to recognize and monitor the attention level of the driver with high accuracy and acceptable timing.", "fields_of_study": null, "external_ids": {"arxiv": null, "mag": "2967406282", "acl": null, "pubmed": null, "pubmedcentral": null, "dblp": null, "doi": "10.3390/electronics8080890"}}, "content": null, "year": 2023, "month": 12, "day": 17}
