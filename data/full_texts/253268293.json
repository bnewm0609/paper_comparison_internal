The core of recommendation is to use massive user behavior records (historical user-item interaction information) to model user interest, then precisely match user interest with candidate items. In order to model user interest, early recommender systems [14,16,25] usually follow the collaborative filtering [26] idea which assumes that like-minded users tend to exhibit similar preferences on items. By capturing the collaborative signals in historical user-item interactions, recommender systems can learn latent users and items representations which contain users' interests. Specifically, they directly factorize user-item interaction matrix as the product of two low-rank matrices that are taken as users and items representations. Due to the more prominent modeling ability, more and more researchers resort to deep neural networks to capture user interest and learn user/item representation in recent years. At present, the mainstream deep learning based recommendation methods can be divided into two categories: sequence-based recommendation [9,10,12] and graph-based recommendation [3,11,22].\n\nSequence-based recommendation methods organize all historical user-item interactions into sequences. Concretely, for each user, they collect all items which the user has interacted with to construct chronological user sequence. By employing sequential framework such as recurrent neural network, self-attention network to model the changes of user sequences and mine the sequential patterns, sequence-based recommendation methods can characterize the dynamic user interest.\n\nAs user-item interactions are typical relation data, they can be naturally organized into a useritem bipartite graph. Graph-based recommendation methods are based on the user-item bipartite graph and design powerful graph neural networks to capture its structure information. By iterative neighborhood aggregation operation, graph-based recommendation methods learn salient user/item representation and model user interest.\n\nAlthough existing sequence-based and graph-based methods show good performances, they do not fully explore the potential factors which influence user interest. What's more, they ignore the formation process of user-item interaction which is the direct reflection of user interest. Therefore, existing methods cannot accurately capture user interest and result in suboptimal recommendation. Meanwhile, sequence-based methods directly estimate the item transition probability in user sequence, while graph-based methods conduct neighborhood aggregation to obtain user/item representation and estimate the plausibility of user-item interaction based on user/item representation. Both of these methods implicitly model user interest and operate in a black-box fashion. Hence, they cannot clearly show which factor contributes to the recommendation. The lack of interpretability also hinders the further analysis and improvement of the recommender system.\n\nOn the other hand, as Euclidean space is the natural generalization of our intuition-friendly and visible three-dimensional space, most of existing recommender systems embed user/item into Euclidean space to achieve recommendation. However, some recent works [2,19,20] show that many real-world recommendation datasets exhibit tree-like hierarchical structure and follow scale-free distribution in which the number of a node's neighbors grows exponentially with respect to the number of hops. Euclidean space whose volume grows polynomially is not suitable for dealing with the scale-free recommendation data. The mismatch between data distribution and embedding space will cause distortion and lead to the sub-optimal results. Nowadays, there are a few researches [27,30] that pay attention to hyperbolic geometry and attempt to replace Euclidean space with hyperbolic space. As the volume grows exponentially, hyperbolic space can better match the scale-free property of data. Nevertheless, to the best of our knowledge, all existing hyperbolic recommendation works only focus on how to transfer models from Euclidean space to hyperbolic space. During transferring, however, hyperbolic geometry introduces more complex forms to basic operations than Euclidean space such as distance and inner-product. It brings greater challenges to the interpretability of the model, which existing methods almost ignore. In summary, how to fully model user interest and match the scale-free distribution of data in an interpretable framework is a pioneering problem.\n\nTo tackle the problems addressed above, we propose a novel recommendation method, named Explainable Hyperbolic Temporal Point Process for User-Item Interaction Sequence Generation (EHTPP). For the problem of complex influence factors of user interest, we explore four potential factors from local and global perspectives. Specifically, from a local perspective, we define two influence factors: user preference and follow relationship. Firstly, users' fondness degrees of items are different. For example, as shown in Figure 1, user u 1 prefers sporting goods while user u 3 prefers clothes. We define the user preference factor to capture the unique characteristic of each user. Secondly, the behavior of other users will have an impact on the interest of current user. With the rise of live commerce, it is common that users follow other users to buy items. For instance, user u 2 follows user u 1 to buy item i 2 , i 3 , and i 4 , while follows user u 3 to buy item i 9 and i 10 in Figure 1. Follow relationship factor intends to model the influences of potential follow relationships. In addition, from the global perspective, we also define two influence factors: user activeness and popularity tendency. For most recommendation data, a user tends to buy items intensively in a short time interval rather than buy items dispersedly. It leads to some purchasing clusters in user behavior records (green dotted boxes in Figure 1). Due to the aggregative behavior patterns of users, the users' desires to purchase will increase when users are in the time periods of purchasing clusters. Therefore, in order to model the influences, we define user activeness factor to reflect whether the user is in the time periods of purchasing clusters. What's more, the popularity of items varies and different users have different sensitivities to item popularity. Some users (e.g., user u 4 in Figure 1) have high popularity tendency as they like to buy popular items, while some users (e.g., user u 1 in Figure 1) do not. To capture the discrepancies of users' sensitivities to item popularity, we define the popularity tendency factor. In addition, in order to model the formation process of user-item interaction and consider the interpretability of EHTPP simultaneously, we regard each user-item interaction as a random event and use the above influence factors to explicitly model its occurrence probability because these factors determine the interest of the target user. In this way, we can easily observe the modeling process of user interest and give an explanation for the recommendation result. Since temporal point process framework can capture the effects between sequential events well, particularly the influences of historical events on current event, it is in line with our motivation which models four influence factors based on historical interaction records and use them to estimate the occurrence probability of current events. We select temporal point process framework as the backbone of EHTPP. Furthermore, due to the scale-free distribution of data, we map all users and items into a hyperbolic space, and adapt conventional temporal point process framework to hyperbolic space to model the event occurrence probability. Although hyperbolic geometry requires more complex operations, the probability calculation in EHTPP is still based on the four specific factors so that the interpretability of the model is not affected. Finally, in order to train EHTPP, we transform recommendation into a sequence generation problem and maximize the probabilities of all observed interactions. In summary, the main contributions of our work are as follows:\n\n\u2022 We deeply explore user interest and propose four potential influence factors. Based on the pre-defined four influence factors, we model the formation process of user-item interactions which help capture user interest more accurately. \u2022 We design an interpretable recommendation framework based on temporal point process. It transforms recommendation task into user-item interactions sequence generation task and explicitly models the occurrence probabilities of user-item interactions from local and global perspectives. \u2022 To match the scale-free distribution of recommendation data, we adapt the recommendation framework to hyperbolic space and develop a hyperbolic recommender system EHTPP. EHTPP can introduce complex hyperbolic operations while maintaining the model interpretability.\n\n\u2022 We conduct extensive experiments on three public datasets to corroborate the effectiveness of our model. The experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our model over several state-of-the-art recommendation methods regarding three commonly-used evaluation metrics.\n\nThe rest of this paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we provide a comprehensive overview of the related work, including conventional recommendation methods, deep learning based recommendation methods, and hyperbolic recommendation methods. In Section 3, we use three realworld recommendation datasets to analyze and validate the proposed four influence factors. In Section 4, we formulate the temporal recommendation problem and present the proposed EHTPP model in detail. The experimental settings, experimental results, and model analyses are presented in Section 5. Finally, Section 6 concludes our work and discusses the future research directions.\n\n\nRELATED WORK\n\n\nConventional Recommendation Methods\n\nConventional recommendation methods largely depend on user-item interaction matrix and use some non-deep learning techniques to deal with the interaction matrix so as to obtain the user and item embedding representations. According to the similarity between user embedding representation and item embedding representation, conventional recommendation methods can find user interest and finish the recommendation. For example, Koren et al. [16] directly factorize the user-item interaction matrix to generate user and item embedding representations. Besides matrix factorization, Rendle et al. [25] propose an optimization framework for personalized ranking to achieve better recommendation. Koren [15] proposes a unified model which combines the singular value decomposition and neighborhood modeling. By considering the neighborhood information and factor information symmetrically, it can obtain more accurate user and item embedding representations. However, due to the enormous time and space cost, these methods are difficult to deploy in real-world scenarios with large-scale data.\n\n\nDeep Learning based Recommendation Methods\n\nWith the development of deep learning, more and more deep neural network-based recommender systems emerge as they have the ability to learn more salient user/item representation. According to the different organization forms of user-item interaction records, existing deep learning based recommendation methods generally fall into two categories: sequence-based recommendation methods and graph-based recommendation methods.\n\nSequence-based recommendation methods use historical user-item interaction records to construct user sequence for each user. It is noticeable that user sequence consists of all items that current users have interacted with. By designing deep neural networks to model the item transition probability in user sequence, sequence-based recommendation methods can capture user interest and conduct recommendations. Early sequence-based works mainly employ Markov chains [9,10] and recurrent neural networks [12,32] to model the item transition probability. For example, TransRec [9] exploits high-order Markov chains to model the item transitions in user sequences. RRN [32] attempts to use LSTM to explore both the long-term and short-term sequential patterns. In recent years, self-attention networks turn out to be more promising options as they can selectively aggregate relevant items in user sequence for user interest modeling. For instance, DMAN [28] segments user sequence into a series of sub-sequence and use a self-attention framework to model the user's long-term and short-term interests. PIMI [5] refers to the Multi-Head Attention Network [29] to design a multi-attention network which can model the user's multiinterest representations.\n\nGraph-based recommendation methods organize user-item interaction records into user-item bipartite graphs. By modelling the topology structure of the bipartite graph, graph-based methods can indirectly capture user interest and learn powerful user and item representations. As graph neural networks (GNNs) can model the structure information well, most of existing graph-based recommendation methods adopt GNNs as embedding models to achieve a better recommendation result. For instance, LightGCN [11] drops the unnecessarily complicated design of conventional graph convolution network and proposes a light GCN to fit recommendation. UltraGCN [22] resorts to directly approximate the limit of infinite-layer graph convolutions via a constraint loss to capture the long-ranged dependency between user and item. TGSRec [6] defines the continuoustime bipartite graph and designs a novel graph attention mechanism to aggregate the neighbors in the bipartite graph so that it can learn better user and item representations.\n\nHowever, existing sequence-based recommendation methods and graph-based recommendation methods do not fully consider potential influence factors of user interest and ignore the formation  process of user-item interactions which are critical to user interest modeling. What's more, they are black-box methods and implicitly model user interest. So, they inevitably face the dilemma of interpretability.\n\n\nHyperbolic Recommendation Methods\n\nAs mainstream sequence-based recommendation methods and graph-based recommendation methods are modeled in Euclidean space, they cannot match the scale-free distribution of recommendation data. In order to deal with the mismatch problem, a few works have turned to hyperbolic space. Specifically, they use hyperbolic space as embedding space and conduct recommendation based on the learned hyperbolic representations of user and item. For example, HGCF [27] resorts to the tangent space to realize a hyperbolic graph convolution which can be used to learn hyperbolic embedding representations of user and item. LGCF [30] designs a graph convolution model whose operations are directly performed in hyperbolic space. H 2 SeqRec [20] defines the hypergraph to model user's behavior pattern and designs a hyperbolic hypergraph convolutional neural network to learn the dynamic item embedding representation. Although these methods better model the scale-free distribution, they ignore that hyperbolic geometry introduces more complex operations which improve the difficulty of model interpretation. So far as we know, there is no interpretable hyperbolic recommender system.\n\n\nPRELIMINARY\n\nTo fully model user interest, we propose four potential influence factors (user preference, follow relationship, user activeness, and popularity tendency) in the introduction section. In this section, we design four preliminary experiments on three real-world recommendation datasets to verify the rationalities of the four influence factors, respectively. The details of the datasets are presented in the experiments section.\n\n\nUser Preference\n\nIt is common that different users prefer different items in recommender systems. We call the uniqueness of the individual as user preference. In order to show the discrepancies between users' preferences, we take all items which users have interacted with as the reflection of user preference and define user average interaction overlap ratio as follows:\nIOR k = 1 M u m \u2208U |I k \u2229 I m | |I k |(1)\nwhere IOR k is the average interaction overlap ratio of user u k , M is the number of users, and U is the set of users. I k represents the item set which contains all items that user u k has interacted with. |\u00b7| calculates the size of the set. Figure 2 shows the distributions of user average interaction overlap ratio on three datasets. We find that the average interaction overlap ratios of users are small. Especially, in the Amazon-Fashion dataset, the average interaction overlap ratios of most users are less than 0.01. Therefore, we can conclude that there is significant discrepancy between a users' preferences and the recommender system should model this influence.\n\n\nFollow Relationship\n\nThe behavior of different users is not independent of each other, in other words, the behavior of other users may affect the behavior of the current user. For example, someone interacts with an item and then recommends the item to a target user. The target user will increase the interest in this item and follow him/her to interact with it. We attribute this phenomenon to the follow relationship effect. Considering that the follow relationship is usually an implicit relationship, there is no clear label information to indicate who users follow to interact with items in datasets. Consequently, we define a threshold \u03b3 to approximately capture the follow relationship. Specifically, we think that user u k follows user u l to interact with item i only when user u k and user u l have interacted with at least \u03b3 identical items before, and the interaction time of user u k is later than that of user u l . It can be written as:\nII k,l,t = {i | i \u2208 I and (u k , i , t k ) \u2208 G t and (u l , i , t l ) \u2208 G t and t l < t k < t } (2) FT k = |{(u k , u l , i, t ) | (u k , i, t ) \u2208 G k and u l \u2208 U and (u l , i, t l ) \u2208 G t and |II k,l,t | \u2265 \u03b3 }|(3)\nwhere I is the set of items. II k,l,t defines the set of items that user u k and user u l both interact with before time t, and user u k interacts later than user u l . G t represents all user-item interactions before time t and G k represents all interactions of user u k . FT k is the possible follow times of user u k . Since the average interaction number of users varies among datasets, we set the values of \u03b3 to 50, 3, 3 for ML-1M, Behance, Amazon-Fashion datasets, respectively and calculate the possible follow times of all users in these datasets. The results are shown in Figure 3. As we can see, user follow relationship is ubiquitous in the three datasets. In ML-1M dataset, more than a third of users have follow relationships. Thus, follow relationship is an indispensable influence factor for user interest modeling.\n\n\nUser Activeness\n\nIn a real-world scenario, the behavior records of each user usually can be divided into some specific time periods. In these time periods, the user has a strong desire to interact with items and intensively conduct many interactions. However, outside these time periods, the user keeps silent and has no interaction. In order to verify this pattern of user behavior, we define the dispersion ratio which measures the aggregation degree of user behavior. Concretely, we regard that the interactions with an interval of less than an hour belong to the same time period. Then, the dispersion  ratio can be formulated as:\nT P k = tp l k | L k l =1 | \u22001 \u2264 m, n \u2264 L k tp m k \u2229 tp n k = \u2205 and \u222a L k l =1 tp l k = G k (4) DR k = |T P k | |G k |(5)\nwhere tp l k represents the user u k 's interaction set within time period l. The time interval between any two interactions in tp l k is less than one hour. L k is the number of divided time periods and T P k is the set of divided time periods of user u k . DR k is the dispersion ratio of user u k . The lower the dispersion ratio, the less the divided time periods, and the more aggregated the user behavior. Figure 4 shows the distributions of user dispersion ratio on three datasets. We can observe that the behavior records of users show aggregation to a certain extent. Especially, in the ML-1M dataset, aggregation phenomenon is very obvious. Based on the above findings, we define user activeness to model the aggregation pattern of user behavior. Specifically, we calculate user activeness according to recent interaction records of recommender systems and use it to determine whether the user is in the specific time period. The higher the user's activeness, the more likely the user is to be in the specific time period. Then, we assign high interaction probability to the uses with high activeness so that the aggregation pattern can be captured.\n\nIn addition, we further use the occurrence numbers of users to measure their activeness in different time periods. Specifically, when the occurrence number of the user is greater than 4, we regard that the user is active in the current period (also called the user's active period). Then, for the active and inactivate periods of each user, we collect all items that the user has interacted with and calculate the ratio of popular items to unpopular items in the period. Considering the differences of datasets, we regard the items which have been interacted with for 50, 20 and 20 times before as popular items on ML-1M, Behance and Amazon-Fashion datasets, respectively. The results on three datasets are shown in Figure 5. As we can see, there is an obvious interaction difference between the user in active periods and inactive periods. Concretely, users interact with more popular items in active periods than in inactive periods. One possible explanation is that users are more likely to follow the trend when they own strong interaction desire (high activity). The phenomenon also demonstrates that user activeness is very important to interaction modeling and it can implicitly influence user preference.\n\n\nPopularity Tendency\n\nIn a recommender system, the popularity of different items varies. What's more, different users also have different attitudes towards item popularity. For example, some users may be sensitive to popular items so they have a stronger desire to interact with popular items. While other users with low sensitivity have no obvious tendency between popular items and unpopular items. To show this phenomenon, we define user popularity tendency to reflect the popularity sensitivity of the user. For the sake of simplicity, we directly use the occurrence number of item i before time t as the popularity of item at time t. Then, the user popularity tendency is defined as the average popularity of all items which the user interacts with.\nIP j,l = |{(u, i j , t ) | u \u2208 U and (u, i j , t ) \u2208 G t l }| (6) PT k = (u k ,i j ,t l ) \u2208G k IP j,l |G k |(7)\nwhere IP j,l is the popularity of item i j at time t l and PT k is the popularity tendency of user u k . We randomly select 500 users from each dataset and report their popularity tendencies in Figure 6. According to the experimental results, we can observe that the discrepancies between the popularity tendencies of different users are significant. What's more, no matter in which dataset, there are some users that show high popularity tendencies. Therefore, it is important to consider the popularity tendency of the user when modelling user interest.\n\n\nMETHODOLOGY\n\nIn this session, we formulate the temporal recommendation problem and transform it into autoregressive sequence generation. Then we introduce the overall framework of the proposed model EHTPP. Lastly, we elaborate on the core components of EHTPP, including Interaction Embedding, Interaction Generation, and Recommendation. In this paper, we use calligraphic fonts, bold lowercase letters, and bold uppercase letters to denote sets (e.g., G t ), vectors (e.g., x), and matrices (e.g., W), whereas others are scalar. For convenience, some important notations are summarized in Table 1.\n\n\nProblem Formulation\n\nAssume G t := {\u0434 1 , \u0434 2 , . . . ,\u0434 S t } represents the chronological user-item interactions sequence before time t and S t is the size of the sequence.

According to the above problem definition, we can easily transform temporal recommendation into conventional autoregressive sequence generation. By maximizing the likelihood of all observed user-item interactions, we can train recommender systems and model user interest.

Therefore, we regard each interaction as an event and employ temporal point process framework to estimate the likelihood of the event occurring as temporal point process can model the impact In the module of Recommendation, we describe the processes of training and recommendation. It is noticeable that the item recommendation is based on the interaction intensity ranking. The greater the intensity, the greater the probability that the item will be recommended.\n\n\nInteraction Embedding\n\n\nHyperbolic Preliminary.\n\nRiemannian manifold is a branch of differential geometry. It can be defined as the tuple of (M, \u0434). The manifold M is a generalization to higher dimensions of the notion of a 2D surface. The Riemanni metric \u0434 = (\u0434 x ) x\u2208M is a collection of inner-products. Each \nexp c 0 (x) = tanh( \u221a c x ) x \u221a c x(9)\n83:12 Y. Zhou et al.\nlo\u0434 c 0 (x) = tanh \u22121 ( \u221a c x ) x \u221a c x(10)\n\nUser and Item\n\nEmbedding. Given Poincar\u00e9 ball model (H n c , \u0434 c ), we map users and items into hyperbolic space. Specifically, we parameterize a user (item) by a vector e u (e i ) \u2208 H d N . d N denotes the dimension of user (item) embedding. We retrieve the embedding of user (item) by indexing an embedding table E = [E U ; E I ] \u2208 H d N \u00d7(M +N ) . M and N are the sizes of user set U and item set I , respectively. Note that the embedding table E is optimized during the training process.\n\n\nContinuous Time Embedding.\n\nAs user interest may change over time, it is crucial to consider continuous time information in recommender systems. Since continuous time does not follow the scale-free distribution, we only need an encoding function to embed continuous time into Euclidean space. In EHTPP, we refer to TGAT [33] to design the time encoder \u03a6. It can be defined as:\n\u03a6(t ) = 1 d T [cos (\u03c9 1 t ), sin(\u03c9 1 t ), . . . , cos (\u03c9 d T t ), sin(\u03c9 d T t )](11)\nwhere \u03c9 = [\u03c9 1 , . . . , \u03c9 d T ] is the trainable parameter and d T is the time embedding dimension.\n\n\nInteraction Generation\n\nAfter interaction embedding, EHTPP employs temporal point process to model the generation process of user-item interactions and instantiates the interaction intensity function with four influence factors. Specifically, EHTPP decomposes the influences of historical information into local influences and global influences. For local influences, EHTPP only focuses on the historical interactions related to the user and item of current interaction, and models user preference and follow relationship. For global influences, EHTPP concentrates on the recent interactions in recommender system, and models user activeness and popularity tendency.\n\n\nInteraction Intensity Function.\n\nTemporal point process models the formation of sequential user-item iteractions by assuming that historical interactions before time t can influence the occurrence of the current interaction at time t. Formally, given the history interaction sequence G t := {\u0434 t 1 , . . . ,\u0434 t i |t i < t } before time t and the conditional intensity function \u03bb(t ), the conditional probability of observing an interaction in the tiny\nwindow [t, t + dt] is \u03bb(t )dt := E[dN (t )|G t ].\nIn addition, we also denote the conditional probability (called survival term) that no interaction happens during [t i , t ) as S (t |G t ) = exp(\u2212 t t i \u03bb(\u03c4 )d\u03c4 ). Based on these definitions, the conditional density that an interaction occurs at time t is defined as f (t ) = \u03bb(t )S (t ). The core of temporal point process is to design the conditional intensity function \u03bb(t ). In this paper, we select the multivariate Hawkes process [18] with the intensity \u03bb(t ) defined as follows:\n\u03bb(t ) = \u03bc (t ) + t \u2212\u221e \u03ba (t \u2212 s)dN (s)(12)\nwhere \u03bc (t ) is the base intensity, describing the arrival of spontaneous user-item interaction. The kernel \u03ba (t \u2212 s) models the time decay of past history and N (t ) is the number of user-item interactions until t. Essentially, t \u2212\u221e \u03ba (t \u2212 s)dN (s) models the influences of historical information on current interaction. In this paper, EHTPP further divides the historical influences into local influence and global influence. Therefore, we reformulate the occurrence intensity of the interaction (u, i, t ) using the following equation:\n\u03bb u,i (t ) = \u03bc (e u , e i ) + \u03b2 1 l_in f (e u , e i , t ) + \u03b2 2 \u0434_in f (e u , e i , t )(13)\nwhere l_in f (\u00b7) and \u0434_in f (\u00b7) represent the local influence and global influence, which will be detailed in Equations (26) and (35), respectively. \u03b2 1 and \u03b2 2 are the trainable parameters which balance the importances of the above influences. \u03bc (\u00b7) is the time-independent base intensity which measures the similarity of the user and item. Here, we define \u03bc (e u , e i ) = \u2212d H (e u , e i ) and d H is the distance of two point e u , e i \u2208 H d N as follows [7]:\nd H (e u , e i ) = (2/ \u221a c)arctanh( \u221a c \u2212 e u \u2295 c e i )(14)e u \u2295 c e i = (1 + 2c e u , e i + c e i 2 )e u + (1 \u2212 c e u 2 )e i 1 + 2c e u , e i + c 2 e u 2 e i 2 ))(15)\nwhere \u2295 c is the M\u00f6bius addition which defines the addition operation in hyperbolic space. Finally, in order to ensure that the intensity is a positive real number and maintain the numerical stability, we employ the sigmoid function:\n\u03bb u,i (t ) = si\u0434moid (\u03bb u,i (t ))(16)\n\nLocal Influence Modeling.\n\nFor local influence modeling, we consider the historical interaction records which belong to the user or item of current interaction. To reduce model complexity and focus on the most informative data, we only extract recent L l historical interactions for the current user and item. Formally, for current interaction (u, i, t ), we define the extracted historical interaction sets as G u\nL l = {\u0434 u 1 , \u0434 u 2 , . . . ,\u0434 u L l } and G i L l = {\u0434 i 1 , \u0434 i 2 , . . . ,\u0434 i L l }. The elements \u0434 u j = {u, i u j , t u j } and \u0434 i k = {u i k , i, t i k }\nrepresent the historical interactions of user u and item i, respectively, where j, k \u2264 L l and t u j , t i k \u2264 t. As user u's historical interaction set G u L l implies the preference of user u, we use it to model the influence of the user preference on the current interaction. Specifically, we compare the current item i with all items which user u has interacted with in G u L l to measure the matching degree between item i and user preference. Since different interactions reflect the multiple user preferences and the influences of different preferences on current interactions are different, we propose a hyperbolic temporal attention mechanism to model such non-uniform influences. For current item i, the influence score of historical interaction (u, i u j , t u j ) can be defined as follows:\ns i u j ,i = \u03c3 a T 1 lo\u0434 c 0 (W 1 \u2297 c e i u j )||lo\u0434 c 0 (W 1 \u2297 c e i )(17)W \u2297 c e = (1/ \u221a c)tanh We e tanh \u22121 ( \u221a c e ) We We(18)\nwhere \u03c3 (\u00b7) is the leakyrelu activation function. a 1 \u2208 R 2d N and W 1 \u2208 H d N \u00d7d N are the trainable parameters. \u2297 c is the M\u00f6bius multiplication which defines the matrix multiplication operation in hyperbolic space. We use logarithmic map lo\u0434 c 0 : H d N c \u2192 T 0 H d N c to project hyperbolic embedding into Euclidean space so that we can conduct the basic vector operation such as vector concatenation.\n\nIn addition, we integrate the continuous time embedding and model the time decay effect on user preference. For current time t, the time decay effect of historical interaction (u, i u j , t u j ) can be written as:\ntime_up_in f t u j = exp \u2212\u03b4 l i \u03a6(t ) T \u00b7 \u03a6 t u j(19)\nwhere the discount rate \u03b4 l \u2208 R N is an item-dependent parameter which illustrates the fact that different items have different sensitivities to the time decay effect on user preference. For example, items with fast upgrading are more sensitive to the time decay effect. After that, we define the attention weight of interaction (u, i u j , t u j ) as:\na i u j ,i = exp(s i u j ,i \u00b7 time_up_in f (t u j )) p \u2264L l exp(s i u p ,i \u00b7 time_up_in f (t u p ))(20)\nFinally, we can aggregate the historical items information which user u has interacted with to model the user preference influence. It can be represented as:\nh up_u = (u,i u j ,t u j ) \u2208G u L l a i u j ,i \u00b7 lo\u0434 c 0 (e i u j )(21)\nOn the other hand, the extracted item i's historical interaction set G i L l contains the potential follow relationships which also can influence the current interaction. However, for current user u, the probabilities of following different users are different. It's because users tend to follow authorities or the users who they are familiar with in the real world. Therefore, similar to user preference modeling, we compare the current user u with all users who have interacted with item i in G i L l and design another hyperbolic attention mechanism to model the influence of the follow relationship. The modeling process can be defined as follows:\ns u i k ,u = \u03c3 a T 2 lo\u0434 c 0 (W 2 \u2297 c e u i k )||lo\u0434 c 0 (W 2 \u2297 c e u ) (22) time_f r_in f t i k = exp \u2212\u03b7 l u \u03a6(t ) T \u00b7 \u03a6 t i k (23) a u i k ,u = exp(s u i k ,u \u00b7 time_f r_in f (t i k )) p \u2264L l exp(s u i p ,u \u00b7 time_f r_in f (t i p ))(24)h f r _i = (u i k ,i,t i k ) \u2208G i L l a u i k ,u \u00b7 lo\u0434 c 0 (e u i k )(25)\nwhere a 2 \u2208 R 2d N and W 2 \u2208 H d N \u00d7d N are the trainable parameters. Discount rate \u03b7 l \u2208 R M is a userdependent parameter which captures the user sensitivity to the time decay effect on the follow relationship.\n\nAs local influence includes user preference factor and follow relationship factor simultaneously, we adopt negative distance between h up_u and h f r _i to integrate them, which indicates whether u and i will interact at the current time t from a local perspective. Formally, the local influence of historical information l_in f (\u00b7) on current interaction (u, i, t ) can be defined as follows:\nl_in f (e u , e i , t ) = \u2212d H exp c 0 (h up_u ), exp c 0 (h f r _i )(26)\nwhere the exponential map exp c 0 :\nT 0 H d N c \u2192 H d N c\nprojects Euclidean vector back to hyperbolic space.\n\n\nGlobal Influence Modeling.\n\nBesides the local influence, the global situation of recommender system in the recent period can also affect the current interaction. In order to model the global influence, we extract the last L \u0434 interaction records before current time t and construct the interaction\nset O t = {o 1 , o 2 , . . . , o L \u0434 }, where o m = {u m , i m , t m }, m \u2264 L \u0434 and t m \u2264 t.\nFor the user-side of the extract interaction set O t , the users who have interacted with items recently can be regarded as the active users at the current time. Therefore, we use them to measure the activeness of current user u and model the influence of user activeness on current interaction. Considering that different active users may contribute differently to the activeness of the current user, we compare current user u with all active users to calculate their activeness contribution scores. Specifically, for active user u m in interaction (u m , i m , t m ), we define the contribution score as:\ns u,u m = \u03c3 a T 3 lo\u0434 c 0 (W 3 \u2297 c e u )||lo\u0434 c 0 (W 3 \u2297 c e u m )(27)\nwhere a 3 \u2208 R 2d N and W 3 \u2208 H d N \u00d7d N are the trainable parameters. Since time information is closely related to user activeness, we also define the time decay effect on user activeness as:\ntime_ua_in f (t m ) = exp \u2212\u03b7 \u0434 u (\u03a6(t ) T \u00b7 \u03a6(t m ))(28)\nwhere discount rate \u03b7 \u0434 \u2208 R M is a user-dependent parameter which reflects the sensitivity difference of users to time decay in user activeness modeling. Then the attention weight can be written as:\na u,u m = exp(s u,u m \u00b7 time_ua_in f (t m )) p \u2264L \u0434 exp(s u,u p \u00b7 time_ua_in f (t p ))(29)\nFinally, we aggregate all active users to model the user activeness influence as follows:\nh ua_u = (u m ,i m ,t m ) \u2208O t a u,u m \u00b7 lo\u0434 c 0 (e u m )(30)\nFor the item-side of the extract interaction set O t , we treat the items which have appeared in the recent interaction records as the popular items at the current time. What's more, we use the above popular items to model the influence of popularity tendency which we have introduced in Section 3.4. However, popularity tendency influence consists of two parts: the popularity of the current item and the tendency of the current user. Firstly, we compare current item i with all popular items to model the popularity of it. Specifically, the popularity contribution score of item i m in interaction (u m , i m , t m ) is represented as:\ns i,i m = \u03c3 a T 4 lo\u0434 c 0 (W 4 \u2297 c e i )||lo\u0434 c 0 (W 4 \u2297 c e i m )(31)\nwhere a 4 \u2208 R 2d N and W 4 \u2208 H d N \u00d7d N are the trainable parameters. Then, we define the time decay effect in item popularity modeling:\ntime_pt_in f (t m ) = exp \u2212\u03b4 \u0434 i (\u03a6(t ) T \u00b7 \u03a6(t m ))(32)\nwhere \u03b4 \u0434 \u2208 R N is an item-dependent parameter which reflects the sensitivities of items to time decay in item popularity modeling. On the other hand, for the user tendency, we employ a userdependent parameter \u03c4 \u2208 R M to model. Furthermore, we draw on the idea of temperature softmax [13] to combine the item popularity with user tendency to model popularity tendency. The attention weight is designed as:\na i,i m = exp(s i,i m \u00b7 time_pt_in f (t m )/\u03c4 u ) p \u2264L \u0434 exp(s i,i p \u00b7 time_pt_in f (t p )/\u03c4 u )(33)\nFinally, we aggregate all popular items to calculate the influence of popularity tendency:\nh pt _i = (u m ,i m ,t m ) \u2208O t a i,i m \u00b7 lo\u0434 c 0 (e i m )(34)\nSimilar to local influence modeling, we model the global influence as the negative distance between h ua_u and h pt _i to consider user activeness factor and popularity tendency factor at the same time. It indicates the intensity of current interaction from a global perspective. Formally, the global influence of historical information \u0434_in f (\u00b7) on current interaction (u, i, t ) can be defined as follows: So far, based on the basic similarity of users u and item i (Equation (14)), local influence modeling (Equation (26)), and global influencing modeling (Equation (35)), we have completed the modeling of interaction intensity (Equations (13) and (16)).\n\u0434_in f (e u , e i , t ) = \u2212d H (exp c 0 (h ua_u ), exp c 0 (h pt _i ))(35)\n\nRecommendation\n\nAs mentioned in Subsection 4.4, the conditional density f (t ) which consists of the interaction intensity \u03bb(t ) (Equation (12)) and the survival term S (t ) determines the occurrence of the interaction. Therefore, we maximize the conditional densities of all observed interactions to train EHTPP and model user interest. Formally, given a list of interactions as\nO = {(u b , i b , t b )} B\nb=1 observed in a time window [0,T ], we take the logarithm of f (t ) and define the loss function of EHTPP by minimizing the negative joint log-likelihood:\nL = \u2212 B b lo\u0434\u03bb u b ,i b (t b ) + T 0 u,i \u03bb u,i (t )dt (36) where B b lo\u0434\u03bb u b ,i b (t b ) is the interaction intensity and T 0 u,i \u03bb u,i (t )\nis the survival term. To accelerate the evaluation of the survival term, we employ the similar negative sampling approach used in TDIG-MPNN [4]. Specifically, for each interaction\n(u b , i b , t b ), we sample 2K negative user-item pairs {(u k , i b , t b ) K k=1 } and {(u b , i k , t b ) K k=1\n} based on the frequencies of users and items. Hence, the loss function Equation (36) can be rewritten as follows:\nL = \u2212 B b lo\u0434\u03bb u b ,i b (t b ) + K k E[lo\u0434\u03bb u k ,i b (t b )] + K k E[lo\u0434\u03bb u b ,i k (t b )](37)\nIn the final recommendation phase, for current time t and target user u, we rank all candidate items by calculating the interaction intensity \u03bb u,i (t ) between the target user and the candidate item.\n\n\nEXPERIMENTS 5.1 Experimental Setting\n\n\nDatasets.\n\nWe conduct experiments over three public benchmarks. Statistics of them are summarized in Table 2. ML-1M [24] collects users' rating scores for movies. Behance [8] collects likes and image data from the community art website Behance. Amazon-Fashion is from the wellknown Amazon review dataset. For each dataset, we chronologically split for train/validation/test in 80%/10%/10% based on the interaction timestamp.\n\n\nBaselines.\n\nWe compare our model with competitive baselines from the following four categories:\n\n\u2022 Sequence-based Recommendation Methods: We experiment with one Markov chains-based method TransRec [9], one recurrent neural network-based method RRN [32], and two selfattention network-based methods DMAN [28] and PIMI [5]. All of the above models aim to design advanced neural networks to model user interest based on sequential user behavior history. \u2022 Graph-based Recommendation Methods: We select two graph convolution network based methods LightGCN [11], UltraGCN [22] and one graph attention network-based method TGSRec [6]. The above recommendation methods extend existing graph neural networks to model the user-item bipartite graph. \u2022 Hyperbolic Recommendation Methods: We choose three hyperbolic recommender systems HGCF [27], LGCF [30], and H 2 SeqRec [20] as baselines. It is worth noting that existing hyperbolic recommendation methods are graph-based. \n\n\nImplementation.\n\nIn order to enable a fair comparison, for all methods, we set the user embedding dimension, item embedding dimension, learning rate, batch size, and maximum epoch to 128, 128, 0.001, 100, and 20, respectively. The other model parameters of baselines keep their reported default values. Furthermore, for EHTPP and its variants, we use Adam as the optimizer and set the dimension of time embedding d T to be the same as that of the user (item) embedding. We also set the negative sampling size K to 5. The sizes L l and L \u0434 of extracted interaction sets in local influence modeling and global influence modeling are searched from {1, 5, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50}. All models are implemented with Pytorch in a Tesla V100 PCIE GPU (32 GB).\n\nIn the test phase, in order to accelerate the evaluation, we sample 100 negative items for each interaction. We evaluate the recommendation performance by standard evaluation metrics Hit Rate (Hit@K), Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain (NDCG@K) and Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR). Table 3 shows the performances of all models on three datasets. We can see that EHTPP consistently outperforms the other models on all datasets and metrics. Specifically, compared with the best baselines, EHTPP achieves 11.84%, 38.35%, and 11.73% improvements in MRR on the ML-1M, Behance, and Amazon-Fashion, respectively. These results indicate the high effectiveness of our model.\n\n\nPerformance Comparison\n\nMoreover, hyperbolic recommendation methods achieve better performances than Euclidean recommendation methods. In particular, the performance difference between ETPP and EHTPP is substantial. It implies that hyperbolic space is superior to Euclidean space as hyperbolic space can match the data structure better than Euclidean space. Nevertheless, the Euclidean version of our model (ETPP) still achieves a comparable performance to the state-of-the-art hyperbolic recommendation model (H 2 SeqRec). It verifies once again that the motivation of explicitly modelling the proposed four influence factors from local and global perspectives is effective for recommendation.\n\n\nAblation Study\n\nIn order to analyze the contribution from each component of EHTPP to the overall performance, we conduct the extensive ablation studies with results shown in Table 4. Obviously, ETHPP significantly outperforms the other variants, which demonstrates each component improves the performance effectively. The improvement of EHTPP over EHTPP-Tem validates that encoding continuous time into the model and consider the time decay influence are beneficial to  opposite. This can be potentially attributed to the different densities of datasets. For dense datasets, user activeness and item popularity change rapidly over time. Therefore, global influence modeling become more critical. However, for sparse datasets, recommender systems are more stable. EHTPP pays more attention to user preference and follow relationship to exactly model user interest.\n\n\nUser Preference Modelling Analysis\n\nAs introduced in Subsection 3.1, different users have different preferences. Hence, we design an experiment to test the user preference modeling ability of our model. Specifically, we directly use user's historical interactions to represent the user preference and employ the interaction overlap size to measure the preference similarity of the user pair. Interaction overlap size is the item number that both users have interacted with. In order to accelerate the test, we only focus on the interaction overlap sizes in the range of 0 to 70 and divide them into seven groups (e.g., [0, 10), [10,20), . . . , . . . [60, 70)). Then, for each group, we only randomly select 100 user pairs and calculate the average embedding distance of them. In this experiment, we choose TGSRec, ETPP, and EHTPP as the encoders to obtain the user's embeddings. The experimental results on three datasets are shown in Figure 8. We can find that EHTPP has obvious advantages in user preference modeling. The distance gap between the user pairs with similar preference and the user pairs with dissimilar preference is significant. In particular, EHTPP can push the users away when their interaction overlap size is small. The reason may be that hyperbolic space owns the stronger encoding ability which helps EHTPP model the differences of user preferences. Nevertheless, the European variant ETPP performs better than the strong baseline TGSRec. It demonstrates that the proposed user interest modeling is also beneficial to user preference capturing.\n\n\nFollow Relationship Modelling Analysis\n\nTo verify whether EHTPP captures the follow relationship in user interest modeling, we collect the attention scores a u i k ,u (Equation (24)) in local influence modeling and draw a boxplot to show  . We can observe that attention weight increases with the increase of follow times. It is in line with our expectation that the target user tends to follow the users who the target user has followed many times. Therefore, EHTPP can capture the potential follow relationship well. What's more, for a more intuitive display, we randomly select a user (id:1784) and an item (id:11040) as the target user and the candidate item in the Behance dataset. Next, we extract the users who have interacted with the candidate item and calculate the attention weights a u i k ,u of them. The distribution of attention weights and the historical interaction records of the above users are illustrated in Figure 10. Although user 5202 and the target user own larger interaction overlap size, the attention weight of user 2993 is still greater than that of user 5202 as the target user follows user 2993 more times. It demonstrates the follow relationship modeling ability of our model again.\n\n\nUser Activeness Modelling Analysis\n\nConsidering that user activeness can influence the current interaction and result in the aggregation phenomenon of user behavior (introduced in Section 3.3), we design an experiment to demonstrate the ability of EHTPP to model the aggregation characteristic. Specifically, for each interaction, we calculate the conditional intensity \u03bb (Equation (16)) and the occurrence number of the current user in recent interaction records. Then, we depict the relation between them on three datasets as in Figure 11.\n\nWe can see that the greater the occurrence number of the current user, the greater the interaction intensity. It indicates that EHTPP can model user activeness and capture the aggregation pattern of user behavior by assigning high interaction intensities to active users.  \n\n\nPopularity Tendency Modelling Analysis\n\nIn Section 3.4, we have found that the popularity tendencies of different users are various. Therefore, we design an experiment to verify whether EHTPP can model the difference. Specifically, for each user, we recommend 10 items according to the interaction intensity and calculate the ratio of popular items to all recommended items. Here, we define the items which have appeared in recent interaction records as popular items. Then, we split users into seven groups based on their popularity tendencies (Equation (7)) and calculate the average popular item ratio of each group. The final results are reported in Figure 12. We can observe that EHTPP recommends more popular items to the users with high popularity tendencies, while the ratio of popular items degrades when recommending to the users with low popularity tendencies.\n\nIn order to more clearly show the advantages of our model in popularity tendency modeling, we randomly select two users u h (id: ASBOY5GB5OFN9) and u l (id: A127HKC676EBWF) who have high popularity tendency and low popularity tendency, respectively, in the Amazon-Fashion dataset. Next, we list the detailed recommendation results of different models for the above two users. As shown in Table 5, EHTPP can recommend items based on the user popularity tendency. Comparing with user u l (low popularity tendency), EHTPP recommends more popular items to user u h (high popularity tendency). However, other baselines cannot adjust the recommendation strategy according to different popularity tendencies.\n\n\nInterpretability\n\nAlthough the above experiments verify that EHTPP can model user preference, follow relationship, user activeness, and popularity tendency well, it is unclear whether each influence factor modeling module of EHTPP can give a good explanation to the corresponding influence factor in recommendation. Therefore, we further design experiments to examine the correlation between the changes in module modeling and the changes of influence factors so as to demonstrate the interpretability of EHTPP. Specifically, we construct simulated datasets by perturbing original datasets and imple- (\u00b7) represents the popularity of items and bold represents the popular item. ment EHTPP on these simulated datasets to explore the modeling process of different modules of EHTPP. Here, we select the Amazon-Fashion dataset as the original dataset. For user preference modeling module, we randomly select a user-item interaction \u0434 f 1 (u f 1 : A3MROQVM2OB1CJ, i f 1 : B001NGIV56) as the current interaction and construct some fake user-item interaction records. It is noticeable that fake interactions are the same as \u0434 f 1 except for the interaction time and all of them are historical interactions (happen before \u0434 f 1 ). By repeatedly adding these fake interactions into the original dataset, we can increase the preference of the current user for the current item. Then, we calculate the distances between the user preference influence h up_u f 1 (Equation (21)) and the current item under different user preferences. Here, we adopt the distance defined in Equation (14) and the results are shown in Figure 13(a). We can see that the distance decreases with the increase of user preference for the current item. This verifies that the above distance exactly captures the user preference and it provides insight into the influence of user preference in recommendation.\n\nFor follow relationship modeling module, we also randomly select a user-item interaction \u0434 f 2 (u f 2 : A9MIA44HPFPWJ, i f 2 : B00XM2Z76U) as the current interaction and randomly select one user (u f : A18EN5WJK32IFZ) who has interacted with the current item to research the follow relationship between the current user and the selected user. In order to simulate the situations where the current user follows the selected user for different times, we construct some fake following records between them and add these fake records into the original dataset. The definition of follow behavior is the same as that in the preliminary section. Finally, we depict the relation between following times and attention score a uf ,u f 2 (Equation (24)) in Figure 13(b). From the figure, we can see that the attention weight increases as following times increase. Therefore, the distribution of attention weight explicitly reflects the follow relationship and we can use it to observe the influence of follow relationship in recommendation.\n\nFor user activeness modeling module, we randomly select a user-item interaction \u0434 f 3 (u f 3 : A2E73W34025HM9, i f 3 : B00CO91W4I) as the current interaction and randomly sample items to construct fake interactions of the current user. By adding different numbers of fake interactions into the recent history of the recommender system, we can change the activeness of the current user. In the scenarios with different user activeness, we calculate the distances between user activeness influence h ua_u f 3 (Equation (30)) and the current user. Here, we also adopt the distance defined in Equation (14) and the experimental results are shown in Figure 13(c). We can see that the more active the user, the smaller the distance. Consequently, the above distance can reflect the change of user activeness well and we can use it to intuitively interpret the influence of user activeness in recommendation.\n\nFor popularity tendency modeling module, we randomly select two interactions \u0434 f 4 (u f 4 : A2USAEJ9AF58U3, i f 4 : B00XMJ7BE4) and \u0434 f 5 (u f 5 : A3BBZ8RY9B99X2, i f 5 : B00XMIVLC8). The user in \u0434 f 4 has high popularity tendency (PT = 53.4) and the user in \u0434 f 5 has low popularity tendency (PT = 3.27). The definition of popularity tendency (PT ) refers to Equation (7). Then, we randomly sample some users and combine them with the items i f 4 and i f 5 to construct fake useritem interactions. By adding these fake interactions into the recent history of the recommender system, we can change the popularity of items i f 4 and i f 5 . We further observe the changes of the distance between popularity tendency influence (Equation (34)) and the current item when item popularity changes. Concretely, we use Equation (14) to calculate the distances d  Figure 13(d). We can find that the distance d pt i f 4 decreases with the increase of item popularity, while the distance d pt i f 5 is more stable. It indicates that the above distance can reflect the interaction difference of users with different popularity tendency so that it can be used to explain the influence of popularity tendency in recommendation.  To sum up, we validate the interpretability of different modules of EHTPP. By analysis modeling processes of these modules, we can find which influence factors affect recommendation and how they affect the recommendation. So, we can give a good explanation to the recommendation results. Figure 14 shows the impacts of interaction set sizes L l and L \u0434 which are defined in local influence modeling and global influence modeling, respectively. The results demonstrate that the optimal values of L l and L \u0434 vary with datasets. For the dense ML-1M dataset, EHTPP extracts more user's (item's) historical information to model user preference and follow relationship. However, we find that L l = 5 is enough on the sparse Amazon-Fashion and Behance dataset. In any case, EHTPP requires much global historical information to model the user activeness and popularity tendency. It is because the extracted active users and popular items cannot reflect the global situation of the recommender system well when only a few recent interaction records are considered.\n\n\nParameter Analysis\n\nWe also study the impacts of our model w.r.t. the dimension of user (item) embedding dimension d N and negative sample size K on three datasets. Figure 15 shows the experimental results. We observe that EHTPP is not sensitive to embedding dimension d N and it achieves the good performances even if d N is small. It is attributed to the advantage of hyperbolic space in low dimensional situation. For negative sample size K, 5 is the most suitable value. This is because the performance of EHTPP does not change significantly when continuing to increase K. However, sampling too many times will reduce the efficiency of EHTPP.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nIn this paper, we propose a novel method named EHTPP for temporal recommendation. EHTPP not only fully models user interest and matches the scale-free distribution of data, but also maintains the model interpretability. For complexity of user interest, we conduct preliminary experiments on three real-world datasets and find four potential factors which have impacts on user interest. By employing these factors to explicitly model user-item interaction formation process from local and global perspectives, EHTPP can comprehensively capture user interest. In order to match the scale-free distribution and provide the good interpretability, EHTPP takes user-item interactions as random events in hyperbolic space and transforms temporal recommendation into useritem interaction sequence generation. Furthermore, EHTPP develops a hyperbolic temporal point process framework to model the the generation probabilities of interactions, where the calculation of conditional intensity function is guided by the above four factors. Extensive experiments on three datasets show that the proposed EHTPP achieves improvements over state-of-the-art baselines. Moreover, various analysis experiments validate that EHTPP can well model user preference, follow relationship, user activeness, and popularity tendency simultaneously.\n\nOur future work focuses on the following three aspects. First, besides the interaction between user and item, there are relations between users (e.g., friendship). We plan to explore social relation to make better recommendations. Second, users and items usually own unique attribute information, we will try to use this auxiliary information to enhance recommendation quality. Third, recommender system inevitably encounters cold-start problems. We intend to improve EHTPP further so that it can work in such a scenario.\n\nFig. 1 .\n1A toy example of recommendation.

The overall architecture of EHTPP is illustrated inFigure 7. Specifically, EHTPP consists of three major components: Interaction Embedding, Interaction Generation, and Recommendation. (1) In the module of Interaction Embedding, EHTPP considers users, items, and continuous time information simultaneously. Specifically, it maps users and items into hyperbolic space while it embeds continuous time into low dimensional vector space. It is because users and items exhibit the scale-free distribution but time information does not.(2) In the module of Interaction Generation, EHTPP defines intensity function in temporal point process to estimate the likelihood of interaction occurring. Concretely, EHTPP factorizes intensity function into four factors from local and global perspectives. By designing hyperbolic attention mechanisms to explicitly model the four factors, EHTPP can capture the local and global influences of historical interactions on the current interaction.(3) \n\n\n\u0434 x : T x M \u00d7 T x M \u2192 R defines the inner product on tangent space T x M at the point x \u2208 M, where the tangent space T x M is an n-dimensional vector space and can be seen as a first order local approximation of M around point x. Hyperbolic space is the constant negative curvature \u2212c (c > 0) Riemannian manifold. As there are multiple equivalent models for hyperbolic space, we adopt the Poincar\u00e9 ball model (H n c , \u0434 c ) which is a compact representation providing visualization and interpreting hyperbolic embeddings. The manifold H n c = {x \u2208 R n : c x < 1} is an open n-dimensional ball. The Riemannian metric \u0434 c can be defined as \u0434 c x = \u03bb 2 x \u0434 E where \u03bb 2 \u0434 E = I n is the Euclidean metric tensor. Furthermore, exponential map exp c 0 : T 0 H n c \u2192 H n c and logarithmic map lo\u0434 c 0 : H n c \u2192 T 0 H n c which bridge the gap between hyperbolic space and tangent space can be represented as follows:\n\n\u2022\nVariants of EHTPP: We design four variants of EHTPP: ETHPP-Tem, EHTPP-L, EHTPP-G, and ETPP. EHTPP-Tem removes the continuous time embedding and ignores the time decay effect. EHTPP-L and EHTPP-G only consider the global influence and local influence, respectively, when modeling the interaction intensity. ETPP transfers all embeddings and operations of EHTPP to Euclidean space.\n\nFig. 9 .\n9The attention scores a u i k ,u w.r.t. user follow times on three datasets.\n\nFig. 10 .\n10A case study of following relationship modeling on the Behance dataset. the attention weight distributions under different follow times.
