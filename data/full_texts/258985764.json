INTRODUCTION\n\nP RECIPITATION is a crucial component of the global and regional water cycles and plays an important role in weather-, water-, and climate-related research and applications. In the context of climate change, the water cycle is accelerated, Manuscript  resulting in more frequent flash floods. In addition, owning to rapid urbanization, densely populated areas are more vulnerable to urban flash floods and other weather extremes [1], [2], [3]. Therefore, accurate and timely estimation of precipitation is critical to decision-making regarding severe weather and water resources management. Radars and rain gauges are the two main instruments used for precipitation monitoring and measurements. Since radars can provide spatially continuous observations over large areas with high temporal resolutions [3], [4], [5], they are considered the cornerstones of the national severe weather observation and forecast infrastructure in many countries. Rain gauges are often used for evaluation and bias correction of radar rainfall estimates since rain gauges provide direct measurements of rainfall, though at point locations [6], [7], [8], [9]. Traditionally, the relationships between radar reflectivity (Z ) and rainfall rate (R), also known as Z -R relations, are utilized for radar quantitative precipitation estimation (QPE), and these relations are still used for many operational radars. Since the introduction of radar polarization [10], a large amount of research effort has been devoted to polarimetric radar systems and QPE based on polarimetric observables, including radar reflectivity, differential reflectivity (Z dr ), and specific differential phase (K dp ) (e.g., [4], [5] [11], [12]).\n\nThe polarimetric variables offer more microphysical information about precipitation such as raindrop shape and size distributions, leading to better rainfall estimates than conventional Z -R relations. Nevertheless, both Z -R and polarimetric radar rainfall relations are generally derived based on nonlinear regression (typically power-law relations) between radar observables and rainfall rates. This type of fixed-parameter power-law relations cannot represent all types of rainfall at multiple climate regimes, or even one climate region. Often, the parametric radar rainfall relations need to be adjusted for regional applications. In addition, the inherent parameterization error in these relations is large, especially in Z -R relations ( [4], [5]). Kirstetter et al. [13] considered the inherent uncertainty in the Z -R relations of different precipitation types based on the multiradar multisensor (MRMS) QPE system, which improved the accuracy of precipitation estimation to a certain extent. Nevertheless, none of these power-law relations could incorporate the spatial features of precipitation in terms of radar observations.\n\nIn recent years, due to the powerful data fitting and information extraction capabilities of deep learning (DL), it has been successfully applied to many research areas such as image classification, object detection, and image segmentation. For example, the convolutional neural networks (CNNs) developed by the Visual Geometry Group (VGG) at the University of Oxford [14] have achieved great success in image classification. In order to take into account the result accuracy and the inference speed of the model, RepVGG [15] uses a reparameterization technique, which can use a multibranch structure when the model training, and convert the multibranch into a single-branch during model testing. In addition, the residual block and dense block in the ResNet [16] and DenseNet [17] networks have addressed the gradient vanishing problem to a large extent when the model layers are too deep: ResNet won the double champion of ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge (ILSVRC) classification and object detection task in 2015, and DenseNet won the Best Paper Award at the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR) in 2017. The three classic models mentioned above have a far-reaching influence on the development of DL, partly because their core building blocks are highly innovative and practical, and are easy to implement. When applied to the QPE task, the core building blocks show promising performance by capturing more spatial correlated information from dual-polarization radar data and the rainfalling process.\n\nIn this article, we use classical DL core building blocks (i.e., dense blocks, residual blocks, and RepVGG blocks) to address the identified issues in radar QPE. In particular, four DL QPE models are designed to extract precipitation information and quantify surface rainfall rate using 3-D polarimetric radar observations above the ground. The feasibility and performance of these DL models are demonstrated and quantified using the Weather Surveillance Radar-1988 Doppler (WSR-88D) observations near Melbourne (KMLB), FL, USA. To the best of our knowledge, this article is among the first studies about using machine learning for quantitative applications of weather radars. Section II describes the study domain and data used in this article. Section III details the architecture of the designed DL models. Section IV presents the experimental results. Discussion and conclusions are provided in Section V.\n\n\nII. STUDY DOMAIN AND DATASETS A. Study Domain\n\nOur study domain is located in the Florida Peninsula, the third most populous state in the United States. Fig. 1 shows the distribution of the rain gauges and the location of the KMLB dual-polarization radar station represented by the yellow dot (80.65 \u2022 W, 28.11 \u2022 N). Here, it should be noted that, due to the degradation of data quality for longer radar observation distance, we only select radar observations and rain gauge data within 150 km from the KMLB radar station as the dataset. Therefore, the red dots and black dots in Fig. 1 represent the distribution of rain gauges within and beyond 150 km from the radar site, respectively. All these rain gauges are from the South Florida Water Management District (SFL) rain gauge network.\n\nFlorida has a subtropical and tropical rainforest climate, with a peculiar peninsula geographical environment. It has more thunderstorm activity than other parts of the United States. Specifically, the frequency of summer thunderstorms in central Florida, our study domain, equals that of the world's maximum thunderstorm areas, i.e., Lake Victoria in Africa and the Amazon basin. 1 Florida often has minor flash floods that may pose a serious threat to human life. In addition to this, most of the study domain is flat and relatively low in elevation, making it less obscuring and more visible for radar observations. Therefore, this is an ideal study domain for QPE.\n\n\nB. Datasets\n\nIn this study, dual-polarization radar data are collected from the KMLB Weather Surveillance Radar-1988 Doppler (WSR-88D) near Melbourne, FL, USA. The KMLB radar is an S-band radar that emits electromagnetic waves with a wavelength of 10.0-11.1 cm. The radar has a maximum detection range of 460 km and an azimuth range of 0 \u2022 -360 \u2022 . Its antenna scanning elevation angle ranges from 0.5 \u2022 to 19.5 \u2022 and can be as low as 0.2 \u2022 or even lower in coastal areas. It takes about 5-7 min to complete a volume scan. The KMLB radar range resolution is 250 m and the radar azimuth resolution is 0.5 \u2022 . The rain gauge data used in this article are collected from the SFL tipping bucket rain gauge network in Florida, which has undergone extensive data quality. These data are also used as the verification data for the Global Precipitation Measurement (GPM) mission of NASA. The above radar and rain gauge data from 2016 to 2019 are used in this study. Specifically, we use the data from 2016 to 2018 for training (80% of the data) and validation (20% of the data), and the data from 2019 as independent test data.\n\nIn general, ground clutter occurs on WSR-88D radar products when the returns from stationary or nearly stationary ground targets are not filtered out. This clutter may be caused by building and wind farms and can be mistakenly considered (c) Differential reflectivity Z dr before quality control. (d) Differential reflectivity Z dr after quality control. (e) Specific differential phase K dp estimated using DROPS2.0 [5]. as real precipitation. Therefore, they need to be filtered out before further processing. The DROPS2.0 algorithm is used in our study to filter the nonprecipitation echoes and estimate the specific differential phase K dp [5]. Fig. 2 shows the radar reflectivity Z and differential reflectivity Z dr before and after quality control, as well as the estimated specific differential phase K dp at 20:34 UTC on 19 July 2017. It should be mentioned that the rain gauge data with rainfall amount less than 2.5 mm and those with rainfall rates less than 1 mm/h are also excluded.\n\nIII. METHODOLOGY Fig. 3 illustrates the pipeline of our DL framework for QPE. It is divided into two independent parts: (a) model training and (b) estimation. In the model training period, the historical 3-D radar and rain gauge data are fed directly into the DL network to train a regressor. The trained regressor is then used to make an estimation for precipitation using newly arrived radar data. Next, we will introduce how to establish the training dataset followed by the model architecture introduction.\n\n\nA. Establishing the Training Dataset\n\nBecause dual-polarization radar observations have been widely used for QPE, here, we use three observables Z , Z dr , and K dp as model's input, where Z is radar reflectivity, Z dr is the difference between horizontal radar reflectivity and vertical radar reflectivity, and K dp is one-half the range derivative of the differential phase shift (\u03c6 dp ) [4]. Meanwhile, since rain gauge observations (i.e., rainfall rate) are the most accurate measurement of precipitation, we use them as the ground truth for model training.\n\nAs the temporal resolution of the two kinds of data is different, we need to align radar observations and rain gauge data. The KMLB radar observations with a temporal resolution of 5-7 min, whereas rain gauges are sparsely located and produce precipitation observations with a temporal resolution of 1 min. In this study, the average value of rain gauge data within the interval of two adjacent radar observations is used as the ground truth. Next, we will introduce how to construct one training data sample.\n\nAs shown in Fig. 4, the input of the model is a tensor T 6\u00d79\u00d79 containing the 3-D radar data of the above three variables in a 9 \u00d7 9 pixel window centered in pixel (5,5). The window size 9 \u00d7 9 is chosen according to the optimal results of our experiments. It should be mentioned that only the lowest and second lowest elevation angles of radar observation data are used in this study. The main reason is that, although the radar beams at high elevation angles can detect rain aloft, due to the ongoing evaporation while falling, some of the rain is evaporated before it reaches the ground, so the rainfall may be overestimated. Therefore, there are three variables and each has two elevation angles, this is how the number 6 (3 \u00d7 2) comes about. For the learning process, the learning target is the nearest rain gauge data (i.e., rainfall rate) corresponding to the central pixel (5,5). To produce a data pool, the 9 \u00d7 9 pixel  window is moved across the radar image sequentially, shifting location one pixel at a time on the radar image generated every 5-7 min. Finally, the total number of samples is 101 337, including training, validation, and testing data.\n\n\nB. Model Architecture\n\nConsidering residual blocks, dense blocks, and RepVGG blocks are flexible, efficient, and generalizable, we use them as the core building blocks of our radar QPE neural networks (RQPENet). RQPENet D1 and RQPENet D2 both use dense blocks as the core building blocks, but differ in the number of model layers. RQPENet R and RQPENet V use residual blocks and RepVGG blocks as the core building blocks, respectively. Among them, we give a detailed introduction to how to use the dense block to build our RQPENet D1 . The other three models can be achieved similarly. In this article, four DL models are evaluated to find which core building block is most suitable for QPE. Fig. 5 shows the overall RQPENet architecture using the dense blocks, i.e., RQPENet D1 . At the beginning of RQPENet D1 , the input is fed into one convolution layer with 96 kernels of size 3 \u00d7 3 followed by four dense blocks and three transition layers. In the end, the rainfall rate (R; units: mm/h-1) is obtained through an adaptive average pooling layer and a fully connected (FC) layer. The dense blocks and transition layers are the two primary components that are used recursively to form the model structure. The detailed structures of the dense blocks and transition layers are introduced below.\n\nEach dense block is composed of several bottleneck layers. Every bottleneck layer has batch normalization, ReLU, and convolution sublayers, i.e., BN-ReLU-Conv (1 \u00d7 1) and BN-ReLU-Conv (3 \u00d7 3). The four dense blocks contain 6, 12, 36, and 24 bottleneck layers respectively. The dense block enables feature reuse through copy and concatenate operations, which increase direct connections between feature maps within a block and ensure maximum information exchange between various layers of the model. The transition layer consists of a 1 \u00d7 1 Conv layer that keeps the same number of channels, followed by an average pooling layer with stride 2. The benefit of the transition layer is to decrease both the model weight parameters and the feature map size while extracting highlevel implicit features.\n\nIn addition, RQPENet D1 involves a hyperparameter k, called growth rate, which sets the number of channels added at each layer within a dense block. In our experiments, k is set to 48. Design as described above strengthens feature transfer, effectively utilizes features in the spatial dimension, helps alleviate the vanishing-gradient problem, and reduces the number of model parameters. The loss function used by RQPENet D1 is defined as the mean square error L of radar rainfall estimates retrievals with respect to rain gauge rainfall observations\nL = 1 N Z \u2212\u1e90 2(1)\nwhere Z and\u1e90 represent the rainfall rate estimated by the model and the training target label, respectively, and N is the total number of samples of the testing dataset. The model weighs are updated through the following equation:\nw i, j,k(new) = w i, j,k(old) \u2212 \u03c1 \u2202L \u2202w i, j,k(old)(2)\nwhere w i, j,k represents the weight associated with the kth features of the jth bottleneck layer within dense block i, and \u03c1 is learning rate. After a detailed description of RQPENet D1 , the other three methods are briefly described below. \n\n\nIV. EXPERIMENTS AND RESULTS\n\n\nA. Comparison Experiments\n\nTo cross-compare the performance of DL models in precipitation estimation, this study also adopts five Z -R relations, including three commonly used parametric relations [see (3a)-(3c)], [18], [19], and two Z -R relations used in Florida [see (3d)-(3e)], [20], as follows:\nR a (Z ) = 1.70 \u00d7 10 \u22122 \u00d7 Z 0.714 (3a) R b (Z ) = 3.64 \u00d7 10 \u22122 \u00d7 Z 0.625 (3b) R(Z , Z dr ) = 1.42 \u00d7 10 \u22122 \u00d7 Z 0.770 \u00d7 10 Z dr 10 \u22121.670 (3c) R d (Z ) = 2.62 \u00d7 10 \u22122 \u00d7 Z 0.687 (3d)\nR K dp = sign K dp \u00d7 54.3|K dp | 0.806 (3e)\n\nwhere Z is in mm 6 m \u22123 , R denotes the rainfall rate in mm/h, K dp is in \u2022 km \u22121 , and sign(K dp ) item allows R to be negative. The subscripts a, b, and d of R correspond to the formula number, which is convenient for distinguishing in the tables.\n\n\nB. Evaluation Metrics\n\nIn this article, the rainfall rate over an hour is accumulated to obtain the hourly radar rainfall amount. For evaluating RQPENet performance on radar precipitation estimating, the root mean squared error (RMSE), mean absolute error (MAE), correlation coefficient (CC), and normalized standard error (NSE) are computed, respectively, as follows:\nRMSE = N n=1 (R n \u2212 G n ) 2 N (4) MAE = N n=1 |R n \u2212 G n | N (5) CC = N n=1 R n \u2212R n G n \u2212\u1e20 n N n=1 R n \u2212R n 2 N n=1 G n \u2212\u1e20 n 2 (6) NSE = N n=1 |R n \u2212 G n | N n=1 G n (7) BIAS = N n=1 R n N n=1 G n (8)\nwhere R n and G n denote the radar precipitation estimates and rain gauge observations (mm) at the nth hour, respectively. R n and\u1e20 n represent the mean of radar precipitation estimates and rain gauge observations (mm) in the test dataset, respectively. N is the total number of hours, which is 3950 in our experiments. Higher CC and BIAS ratios close to 1, or lower RMSE, MAE, and NSE indicate better estimation performance.\n\nIn addition, this article introduces five widely used evaluation metrics in atmospheric science, namely, probability of detection (POD), false alarm ratio (FAR), critical success index (CSI), Heidke skill score (HSS), and Gilbert skill score (GSS). They are, respectively, defined as where TP, TN, FN, and FP denote true positive, true negative, false negative, and false positive, respectively. If the radar precipitation estimates and ground truth are greater than a threshold, they are considered positive, otherwise negative. TP means that the estimates and ground truth are both positive, TN means that they are both negative, FN means that the estimate is negative while the ground truth is positive, whereas FP means that the estimate is positive while the ground truth is negative. GSS has another name \"Equitable Threat Score (ETS),\" which measures the fraction of events that the model is able to correctly estimate after removing the odds of random hits (i.e., Q). GSS is an improvement to CSI, which can balance misses and false alarms, and the evaluation score is fairer. Higher POD, CSI, HSS, GSS, or lower FAR indicate better estimation performance.\n\n\nC. Results and Analysis\n\nWe use the 2019 radar observations and rain gauge data as the testing dataset. First, we evaluate the overall performance of the nine QPE methods, including four DL methods and five Z -R relations in terms of MAE, RMSE, CC, NSE, and BIAS. Then, we derived the evaluation scores (i.e., POD, FAR, CSI, HSS, and GSS) for various RQPENet and Z -R relations under different precipitation thresholds (2, 5, and 10 mm). In addition, three case studies are selected to illustrate the performance of four RQPENet methods. Table I shows the MAE, RMSE, CC, NSE, and BIAS ratio values of the nine QPE methods. Overall, RQPENet D1 achieves superior estimation performance than the other eight approaches. It has the lowest MAE of 1.58 mm, RMSE of 2.68 mm, NSE of 26%, highest CC of 0.92, and BIAS ratio of 0.91. RQPENet D2 achieves the second-best performance. This shows that the dense blocks are more suitable than residual and RepVGG blocks on the QPE task. Fig. 6 shows the scatter plots of precipitation estimation error for different QPE methods, where Fig. 6(a)-(d) corresponds to RQPENet D1 , RQPENet D2 , RQPENet V , and RQPENet R , respectively, and Fig. 6(e)-(i) corresponds to R a (Z ), R b (Z ), R(Z , Z dr ), R d (Z ), and R(K dp ) respectively. The horizontal axis is the hourly rainfall amount observed by the rain gauge, and the vertical axis is the precipitation estimated by the RQPENet. This plot uses the y = log 10 x function to represent the number of samples per scatter point, where x is the actual number of samples at a given scatter point, and y is the color-coded value in the color range. The closer the distribution of scatter points to the red diagonal, Fig. 6. Scatter plots of hourly precipitation estimates from different DL models versus evaluation gauge observations. (a)-(d) RQPENet D1 , RQPENet D2 , RQPENet V , and RQPENet R , respectively. (e)-(i) R a (Z ), R b (Z ), R(Z , Z dr ), R d (Z ), and R(K dp ), respectively. the more similar the quantitative precipitation estimates to the ground truth. Fig. 6(a)-(i) indicates that all nine methods generally underestimate the precipitation, especially at heavy precipitation events. As can be seen from Fig. 6(a), the precipitation estimates of RQPENet D1 are the closest to the rain gauge observations, with an average radar precipitation estimate is 5.52 mm. This shows that the dense blocks-based models can alleviate the problem of precipitation underestimation to a certain extent, while RQPENet D1 is more effective than RQPENet D2 . Fig. 6(e)-(i) is the scatter plots of five traditional methods for precipitation estimation. It can be seen that the estimation results are not as good as those from the machinelearning models.\n\nNext, we demonstrate the QPE performance for different precipitation intensities based on three hourly rainfall accumulation thresholds, i.e., 2, 5, and 10 mm, respectively. Tables II-IV show the quantitative evaluation results of POD, FAR, CSI, HSS, and GSS using nine methods for the QPE task. For all thresholds, RQPENet D1 achieves the highest CSI, HSS, and GSS values which represent it has the best comprehensive performance. For the 2-mm threshold (Table II), RQPENet R achieves the highest POD value. For the 5 and 10 mm threshold (Tables III and IV), R(Z , Z dr ) and R b (Z ) achieve the lowest FAR values, which mean less false alarms. But it should be mentioned that, although POD and FAR are important evaluation metrics, they cannot be used    Fig. 7 shows the area under the curve (AUC) for the nine QPE approaches. The horizontal axis is the error threshold between the precipitation estimates and the ground truth. The vertical axis is the estimated success rate when the error value between the precipitation estimates and the ground truth is less than this threshold. The higher the AUC, the better the model is at precipitation estimation. As shown in    [5 mm, 10 mm], and >10 mm. Fig. 7(b)-(d) shows that RQPENet D1 achieves the best performance in weak to heavy precipitation cases. In general, the results reveal that the dense blocks-based models, i.e., RQPENet D1 and RQPENet D2 , perform best in the QPE task in both heavy rain and weak rain cases, and the RQPENet D1 model has the best comprehensive performance. Finally, we select three real cases to demonstrate the performance of four RQPENet models. Fig. 8 shows the precipitation maps derived from the four models at 21:00 UTC on 19 June 2019, 18:00 UTC on 1 August 2019, and 14:00 UTC on 19 October 2019. Tables V-VII are the quantitative evaluation results of these three cases, respectively. Scrutinizing the rainfall maps in Fig. 8(a)-(d), which are derived from RQPENet D1 , RQPENet D2 , RQPENet V , and RQPENet R , respectively, at 21:00 UTC on 19 June 2019. It can be seen that compared with RQPENet D1 , RQPENet R , and RQPENet V underestimate precipitation in heavy precipitation areas, which is consistent with the analysis in Fig. 6. The evaluation results in Table V show that RQPENet D1 achieves the best performance in this case. Similar results can be found for the other two cases.\n\nV. CONCLUSION In this article, we designed four DL models for QPE using dense blocks, RepVGG blocks, and residual blocks, namely, RQPENet D1 , RQPENet D2 , RQPENet V , and RQPENet R . Dualpolarization radar observations and rain gauge data are used in these DL models. In the data preprocessing stage, we filter the nonprecipitation echoes from radar observation data and align the radar observations and rain gauge observations in the spatial and temporal domains. The training, validation, and testing dataset are collected in Florida during 2016-2019. Ten evaluation metrics are used in our study for quantitative analysis. The experimental results show that dense blocksbased models achieve higher accuracy results in QPE and alleviates the problem of rainfall underestimation in heavy precipitation area compared to the other methods. This is because the unique dense connection structure in dense blocks strengthens the information flow and transmission efficiency across feature maps, encourages feature map reuse, and fully utilizes spatiotemporal information. In addition, RQPENet D1 with deeper layers performs better than RQPENet D2 in terms of overall evaluation metrics and specific precipitation events.\n\nWenyuan Li received the B.Sc. and M.Sc. degrees in electrical engineering from the Shandong University of Science and Technology, Qingdao, China, in 2017 and 2020, respectively.

Residual blocks consist \nof skip connections that allow inputs to skip one or \nmore convolutional layers and are added to the output \nof the last convolutional layer in the module. Residual \nlearning can improve attention to residual or hard-to-\nlearn information in radar data. In RQPENet R , four \nsimilar residual blocks are placed in series, with each \nresidual block containing 3, 4, 23, and 3 bottleneck \nlayers, respectively. \n3) RQPENet V : The RepVGG block is used as the core \nbuilding block in this model. RepVGG adds multiple \nparallel skip connections (i.e., multibrunch structure) in \nthe training stage based on the residual module. Each \nblock has three parallel branches: a main branch with \na convolution kernel size of 3 \u00d7 3, a shortcut branch \n\nwith a convolution kernel size of 1 \u00d7 1, and a BN-only \nshortcut branch. In addition, it is converted to a single-\nbrunch structure during the testing stage to reduce the \nnumber of parameters used by the model. RQPENet V \nhas five stages, and each stage contains 1, 4, 6, 16, and 1 \nRepVGG blocks. \n\n\n\nTABLE I EVALUATION\nIRESULTS OF HOURLY RAINFALL \nESTIMATES FROM NINE QPE METHODS \n\nTABLE II \n\nEVALUATION RESULTS OF HOURLY RAINFALL ESTIMATES FROM \nNINE QPE METHODS.

If a method has only a \nhigh POD value or a low FAR value, it does not mean that \nthe method is good. It is only meaningful when a method \nhas a high POD and a low FAR simultaneously. In general, \nRQPENet D1 has relatively high POD values and relatively \nlow FAR values, which make it achieve the best overall \nperformance. \n\n\n\nTABLE IV EVALUATION\nIVRESULTS OF HOURLY RAINFALL ESTIMATES FROM NINE QPE METHODS.
