Prospective drugs must attack the source of an illness, but must do so while satisfying restrictive metabolic and toxicity constraints. Traditionally, drug discovery is an extended process that takes years to move from start to finish, with high rates of failure along the way. After a suitable target has been identified, the first step in the drug discovery process is \"hit finding.\" Given some druggable target, pharmaceutical companies will screen millions of drug-like compounds in an effort to find a few attractive molecules for further optimization. These screens are often automated via robots, but are expensive to perform. Virtual screening attempts to replace or augment the high-throughput screening process by the use of computational methods (Shoichet, 2004). Machine learning methods have frequently been applied to virtual screening by training supervised classifiers to predict interactions between targets and small molecules.\n\nThere are a variety of challenges that must be overcome to achieve effective virtual screening. Low hit rates in experimental screens (often only 1-2% of screened compounds are active against a given target) result in imbalanced datasets that require special handling for effective learning. For instance, care must be taken to guard against unrealistic divisions between active and inactive compounds (\"artificial enrichment\") and against information leakage due to strong similarity between active compounds (\"analog bias\") (Rohrer & Baumann, 2009). Furthermore, the paucity of experimental data means that overfitting is a perennial thorn.\n\nThe overall complexity of the virtual screening problem has limited the impact of machine learning in drug discovery. To achieve greater predictive power, learning algorithms must combine disparate sources of experimental data across multiple targets. Deep learning provides a flexible paradigm for synthesizing large amounts of data into predictive models. In particular, multitask networks facilitate information sharing across different experiments and compensate for the limited data associated with any particular experiment.\n\nIn this work, we investigate several aspects of the multitask learning paradigm as applied to virtual screening. We gather a large collection of datasets containing nearly 40 million experimental measurements for over 200 targets. We demonstrate that multitask networks trained on this collection achieve significant improvements over baseline machine learning methods. We show that adding more tasks and more data yields better performance. This effect diminishes as more data and tasks are added, but does not appear to plateau within our collection. Interestingly, we find that the total amount of data and the total number of tasks both have significant roles in this improvement. Furthermore, the features extracted by the multitask networks demonstrate some transferability to tasks not contained in the training set. Finally, we find that the presence of shared active compounds is moderately correlated with multitask improvement, but the biological class of the target is not.\n\n\nRelated Works\n\nMachine learning has a rich history in drug discovery. Early work combined creative featurizations of molecules with off-the-shelf learning algorithms to predict drug activity (Varnek & Baskin, 2012). The state of the art has moved to more refined models, such as the influence relevance voting method that combines low-complexity neural networks and k-nearest neighbors (Swamidass et al., 2009), and Bayesian belief networks that repurpose textual information retrieval methods for virtual screening (Abdo et al., 2010). Other related work uses deep recursive neural networks to predict aqueous solubility by extracting features from the connectivity graphs of small molecules (Lusci et al., 2013).\n\nDeep learning has made inroads into drug discovery in recent years, most notably in 2012 with the Merck Kaggle competition (Dahl, November 1, 2012). Teams were given pre-computed molecular descriptors for compounds with experimentally measured activity against 15 targets and were asked to predict the activity of molecules in a held-out test set. The winning team used ensemble models including multitask deep neural networks, Gaussian process regression, and dropout to improve the baseline test set R 2 by nearly 17%. The winners of this contest later released a technical report that discusses the use of multitask networks for virtual screening (Dahl et al., 2014). Additional work at Merck analyzed the choice of hyperparameters when training single-and multitask networks and showed improvement over random forest models (Ma et al., 2015). The Merck Kaggle result has been received with skepticism by some in the cheminformatics and drug discovery communities (Lowe, December 11, 2012, and associated comments). Two major concerns raised were that the sample size was too small (a good result across 15 systems may well have occurred by chance) and that any gains in predictive accuracy were too small to justify the increase in complexity.\n\nWhile we were preparing this work, a workshop paper was released that also used massively multitask networks for virtual screening (Unterthiner et al.). That work curated a dataset of 1,280 biological targets with 2 million associated data points and trained a multitask network. Their network has more tasks than ours (1,280 vs. 259) but far fewer data points (2 million vs. nearly 40 million). The emphasis of our work is considerably different; while their report highlights the performance gains due to multitask networks, ours is focused on disentangling the underlying causes of these improvements. Another closely related work proposed the use of collaborative filtering for virtual screening and employed both multitask networks and kernel-based methods (Erhan et al., 2006). Their multitask networks, however, did not consistently outperform singletask models.\n\nWithin the greater context of deep learning, we draw upon various strands of recent thought. Prior work has used multitask deep networks in the contexts of language understanding (Collobert & Weston, 2008) and multilanguage speech recognition (Deng et al., 2013). Our best-performing networks draw upon design patterns introduced by GoogLeNet , the winner of ILSVRC 2014.\n\n\nMethods\n\n\nDataset Construction and Design\n\nModels were trained on 259 datasets gathered from publicly available data. These datasets were divided into four groups: PCBA, MUV, DUD-E, and Tox21. The PCBA group contained 128 experiments in the PubChem BioAssay database (Wang et al., 2012). The MUV group contained 17 challenging datasets specifically designed to avoid common pitfalls in virtual screening (Rohrer & Baumann, 2009). The DUD-E group contained 102 datasets that were designed for the evaluation of methods to predict interactions between proteins and small molecules (Mysinger et al., 2012). The Tox21 datasets were used in the recent Tox21 Data Challenge (https://tripod. nih.gov/tox21/challenge/) and contained experimental data for 12 targets relevant to drug toxicity prediction. We used only the training data from this challenge because the test set had not been released when we constructed our collection. In total, our 259 datasets contained 37.8M experimental data points for 1.6M compounds. Details for the dataset groups are given in Table 1. See the Appendix for details on individual datasets and their biological target categorization.\n\nIt should be noted that we did not perform any preprocessing of our datasets, such as removing potential experimental artifacts. Such artifacts may be due by com- pounds whose physical properties cause interference with experimental measurements or allow for promiscuous interactions with many targets. A notable exception is the MUV group, which has been processed with consideration of these pathologies (Rohrer & Baumann, 2009).\n\n\nSmall Molecule Featurization\n\nWe used extended connectivity fingerprints (ECFP4) (Rogers & Hahn, 2010) generated by RDKit (Landrum) to featurize each molecule. The molecule is decomposed into a set of fragments-each centered at a non-hydrogen atom-where each fragment extends radially along bonds to neighboring atoms. Each fragment is assigned a unique identifier, and the collection of identifiers for a molecule is hashed into a fixed-length bit vector to construct the molecular \"fingerprint\". ECFP4 and other fingerprints are commonly used in cheminformatics applications, especially to measure similarity between compounds (Willett et al., 1998). A number of molecules (especially in the Tox21 group) failed the featurization process and were not used in training our networks. See the Appendix for details.\n\n\nValidation Scheme and Metrics\n\nThe traditional approach for model evaluation is to have fixed training, validation, and test sets. However, the imbalance present in our datasets means that performance varies widely depending on the particular training/test split. To compensate for this variability, we used stratified Kfold cross-validation; that is, each fold maintains the active/inactive proportion present in the unsplit data. For the remainder of the paper, we use K = 5.\n\nNote that we did not choose an explicit validation set. Several datasets in our collection have very few actives (\u223c 30 each for the MUV group), and we feared that selecting a specific validation set would skew our results. As a consequence, we suspect that our choice of hyperparameters may be affected by information leakage across folds. However, our networks do not appear to be highly sensitive to hyperparameter choice (see Section 4.1), so we do not consider leakage to be a serious issue.\n\nFollowing recommendations from the cheminformatics community , we used metrics derived from the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve to evaluate model performance. Recall that the ROC curve for a binary classifier is the plot of true positive rate (TPR) vs. false positive rate (FPR) as the discrimination threshold is varied. For individual datasets, we are interested in the area under the ROC curve (AUC), which is a global measure of classification performance (note that AUC must lie in the range [0, 1]). More generally, for a collection of N datasets, we consider the mean and median K-fold-average AUC:\nMean / Median 1 K K k=1 AUC k (D n ) n = 1, . . . , N ,\nwhere AUC k (D n ) is defined as the AUC of a classifier trained on folds {1, . . . , K} \\ k of dataset D n and tested on fold k. For completeness, we include in the Appendix an alternative metric called \"enrichment\" that is widely used in the cheminformatics literature . We note that many other performance metrics exist in the literature; the lack of standard metrics makes it difficult to do direct comparisons with previous work.\n\n\nMultitask Networks\n\nA neural network is a nonlinear classifier that performs repeated linear and nonlinear transformations on its input. Let x i represent the input to the i-th layer of the network (where x 0 is simply the feature vector). The transformation performed is\nx i+1 = \u03c3(W i x i + b i )\nwhere W i and b i are respectively the weight matrix and bias for the i-th layer, and \u03c3 is a nonlinearity (in our work, the rectified linear unit (Nair & Hinton, 2010)). After L such transformations, the final layer of the network x L is then fed to a simple linear classifier, such as the softmax, which predicts the probability that the input x 0 has label j:\nP (y = j|x 0 ) = e (w j ) T x L M m=1 e (w m ) T x L ,\nwhere M is the number of possible labels (here M = 2) and w 1 , \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , w M are weight vectors. W i , b i , and w m are learned during training by the backpropagation algorithm (Rumelhart et al., 1988). A multitask network attaches N softmax classifiers, one for each task, to the final layer x L . (A \"task\" corresponds to the classifier associated with a particular dataset in our collection, although we often use \"task\" and \"dataset\" interchangeably. See Figure 1.)\n\n\nExperimental Section\n\nIn this section, we seek to answer a number of questions about the performance, capabilities, and limitations of mas-Input Layer 1024 binary nodes Hidden layers 1-4 layers with 50-3000 nodes Fully connected to layer below, rectified linear activation Softmax nodes, one per dataset sively multitask neural networks:\n\n1. Do massively multitask networks provide a performance boost over simple machine learning methods?\n\nIf so, what is the optimal architecture for massively multitask networks?\n\n2. How does the performance of a multitask network depend on the number of tasks? How does the performance depend on the total amount of data?\n\n3. Do massively multitask networks extract generalizable information about chemical space?\n\n4. When do datasets benefit from multitask training?\n\nThe following subsections detail a series of experiments that seek to answer these questions.\n\n\nExperimental Exploration of Massively Multitask Networks\n\nWe investigate the performance of multitask networks with various hyperparameters and compare to several standard machine learning approaches. Table 2 shows some of the highlights of our experiments. Our best multitask architecture (pyramidal multitask networks) significantly outperformed simpler models, including a hypothetical model whose performance on each dataset matches that of the best single-task model (Max{LR, RF, STNN, PSTNN}).\n\nEvery model we trained performed extremely well on the DUD-E datasets (all models in Table 2 had median 5fold-average AUCs \u2265 0.99), making comparisons between models on DUD-E uninformative. For that reason, we exclude DUD-E from our subsequent statistical analysis. However, we did not remove DUD-E from the training altogether because doing so adversely affected performance on the other datasets (data not shown); we theorize that DUD-E helped to regularize the classifier and avoid overfitting.\n\nDuring our first explorations, we had consistent problems with the networks overfitting the data. As discussed in Section 3.1, our datasets had a very small fraction of positive examples. For the single hidden layer multitask network in Table 2, each dataset had 1200 associated parameters. With a total number of positives in the tens or hundreds, overfitting this number of parameters is a major issue in the absence of strong regularization.\n\nReducing the number of parameters specific to each dataset is the motivation for the pyramidal architecture. In our pyramidal networks, the first hidden layer is very wide (2000 nodes) with a second narrow hidden layer (100 nodes). This dimensionality reduction is similar in motivation and implementation to the 1x1 convolutions in the GoogLeNet architecture . The wide lower layer allows for complex, expressive features to be learned while the narrow layer limits the parameters specific to each task. Adding dropout of 0.25 to our pyramidal networks improved performance. We also trained singletask versions of our best pyramidal network to understand whether this design pattern works well with less data. Table 2 indicates that these models outperform vanilla singletask networks but do not substitute for multitask training.\n\nResults for a variety of alternate models are presented in the Appendix.\n\nWe investigated the sensitivity of our results to the sizes of the pyramidal layers by running networks with all combinations of hidden layer sizes: (1000, 2000, 3000) and (50, 100, 150). Across the architectures, means and medians shifted by \u2264 .01 AUC with only MUV showing larger changes with a range of .038. We note that performance is sensitive to the choice of learning rate and the number of training steps. See the Appendix for details and data.\n\n\nRelationship between performance and number of tasks\n\nThe previous section demonstrated that massively multitask networks improve performance over single-task models. In this section, we seek to understand how multitask performance is affected by increasing the number of tasks.\n\nA priori, there are three reasonable \"growth curves\" (visually represented in Figure 2):\n\nOver the hill: performance initially improves, hits a maximum, then falls.\n\nPlateau: performance initially improves, then plateaus.\n\nStill climbing: performance improves throughout, but with a diminishing rate of return.\n\nWe constructed and trained a series of multitask networks on datasets containing 10, 20, 40, 80, 160, and 249 tasks. These datasets all contain a fixed set of ten \"held-in\" tasks, which consists of a randomly sampled collection of five Table 2. Median 5-fold-average AUCs for various models. For each model, the sign test in the last column estimates the fraction of datasets (excluding the DUD-E group, for reasons discussed in the text) for which that model is superior to the PMTNN (bottom row). We use the Wilson score interval to derive a 95% confidence interval for this fraction. Non-neural network methods were trained using scikit-learn (Pedregosa et al., 2011) implementations and basic hyperparameter optimization. We also include results for a hypothetical \"best\" single-task model (Max{LR, RF, STNN, PSTNN}) to provide a stronger baseline. Details for our cross-validation and training procedures are given in the Appendix. .873 .841 .818 Figure 2. Potential multitask growth curves PCBA, three MUV, and two Tox21 datasets. These datasets correspond to unique targets that do not have any obvious analogs in the remaining collection. (We also excluded a similarly chosen set of ten \"held-out\" tasks for use in Section 4.4). Each training collection is a superset of the preceding collection, with tasks added randomly. For each network in the series, we computed the mean 5-fold-average-AUC for the tasks in the held-in collection. We repeated this experiment ten times with different choices of random seed. Figure 3 plots the results of our experiments. The shaded region emphasizes the average growth curve, while black dots indicate average results for different experimental runs. The figure also displays lines associated with each held-in dataset. Note that several datasets show initial dips in performance. However, all datasets show subsequent improvement, and all but one achieves performance superior to the single-task baseline. Within the limits of our current dataset collection, the distribution in Figure 3 agrees with either plateau or still climbing. The mean performance on the held-in set is still increasing at 249 tasks, so we hypoth- . Held-in growth curves. The y-axis shows the change in AUC compared to a single-task neural network with the same architecture (PSTNN). Each colored curve is the multitask improvement for a given held-in dataset. Black dots represent means across the 10 held-in datasets for each experimental run, where additional tasks were randomly selected. The shaded curve is the mean across the 100 combinations of datasets and experimental runs.\nModel PCBA (n = 128) MUV (n = 17) Tox21 (n = 12) Sign\nesize that performance is still climbing. It is possible that our collection is too small and that an alternate pattern may eventually emerge.\n\n\nMore tasks or more data?\n\nIn the previous section we studied the effects of adding more tasks, but here we investigate the relative importance of the total amount of data vs. the total number of tasks. Namely, is it better to have many tasks with a small amount of associated data, or a small number of tasks with a large amount of associated data?\n\nWe constructed a series of multitask networks with 10, 15, 20, 30, 50 and 82 tasks. As in the previous section, the tasks are randomly associated with the networks in a cumulative manner (i.e., the 82-task network contained all tasks present in the 50-task network, and so on). All networks contained the ten held-in tasks described in the previous section. The 82 tasks chosen were associated with the largest datasets in our collection, each containing 300K-500K data points. Note that all of these tasks belonged to the PCBA group.\n\nWe then trained this series of networks multiple times with 1.6M, 3.3M, 6.5M, 13M, and 23M data points sampled from the non-held-in tasks. We perform the sampling such that for a given task, all data points present in the first stage (1.6M) appeared in the second (3.3M), all data points present in the second stage appeared in the third (6.5M), and so on. We decided to use larger datasets so we could sample meaningfully across this entire range. Some combinations of tasks and data points were not realized; for instance, we did not have enough data to train a 20-task network with 23M additional data points. We repeated this experiment ten times using different random seeds. Figure 4 shows the results of our experiments. The x-axis tracks the number of additional tasks, while the y-axis displays the improvement in performance for the held-in set relative to a multitask network trained only on the held-in data. When the total amount of data is fixed, having more tasks consistently yields improvement. Similarly, when the number of tasks is fixed, adding additional data consistently improves performance. Our results suggest that the total amount of data and the total number of tasks both contribute significantly to the multitask effect.\n\n\nDo massively multitask networks extract generalizable features?\n\nThe features extracted by the top layer of the network represent information useful to many tasks. Consequently, we sought to determine the transferability of these features to tasks not in the training set. We held out ten data sets from the growth curves calculated in Section 4.2 and used the learned weights from points along the growth curves to initialize single-task networks for the held-out datasets, which we then fine-tuned.\n\nThe results of training these networks (with 5-fold stratified cross-validation) are shown in Figure 5. First, note that many of the datasets performed worse than the baseline when initialized from the 10-held-in-task networks. Further, some datasets never exhibited any positive effect due to multitask initialization. Transfer learning can be negative.\n\nSecond, note that the transfer learning effect became . Multitask benefit from increasing tasks and data independently. As in Figure 2, we added randomly selected tasks (xaxis) to a fixed held-in set. A stratified random sampling scheme was applied to the additional tasks in order to achieve fixed total numbers of additional input examples (color, line type). White points indicate the mean over 10 experimental runs of \u2206 mean-AUC over the initial network trained on the 10 held-in datasets.\n\nColor-filled areas and error bars describe the smoothed 95% confidence intervals.\n\nstronger as multitask networks were trained on more data. Large multitask networks exhibited better transferability, but the average effect even with 249 datasets was only \u223c .01 AUC. We hypothesize that the extent of this generalizability is determined by the presence or absence of relevant data in the multitask training set.\n\n\nWhen do datasets benefit from multitask training?\n\nThe results in Sections 4.2 and 4.4 indicate that some datasets benefit more from multitask training than others.\n\nIn an effort to explain these differences, we consider three specific questions:\n\n1. Do shared active compounds explain multitask improvement?\n\n2. Do some biological target classes realize greater multitask improvement than others?\n\n3. Do tasks associated with duplicated targets have artificially high multitask performance?\n\n\nSHARED ACTIVE COMPOUNDS\n\nThe biological context of our datasets implies that active compounds contain more information than inactive compounds; while an inactive compound may be inactive for many reasons, active compounds often rely on similar physical mechanisms. Hence, shared active compounds should be a good measure of dataset similarity. . Held-out growth curves. The y-axis shows the change in AUC compared to a single-task neural network with the same architecture (PSTNN). Each colored curve is the result of initializing a single-task neural network from the weights of the networks from Section 4.2 and computing the mean across the 10 experimental runs. These datasets were not included in the training of the original networks. The shaded curve is the mean across the 100 combinations of datasets and experimental runs, and black dots represent means across the 10 held-out datasets for each experimental run, where additional tasks were randomly selected. Figure 6 plots multitask improvement against a measure of dataset similarity we call \"active occurrence rate\" (AOR). For each active compound \u03b1 in dataset D i , AOR i,\u03b1 is defined as the number of additional datasets in which this compound is also active:\nAOR i,\u03b1 = d =i 1(\u03b1 \u2208 Actives (D d )).\nEach point in Figure 6 corresponds to a single dataset D i . The x-coordinate is\nAOR i = Mean \u03b1\u2208Actives(Di) (AOR i,\u03b1 ) ,\nand the y-coordinate (\u2206 log-odds-mean-AUC) is\nlogit 1 K K k=1 AUC (M ) k (D i ) \u2212logit 1 K K k=1 AUC (S) k (D i ) ,\nwhere AUC  (1 \u2212 p)). The use of log-odds reduces the effect of outliers and emphasizes changes in AUC when the baseline is high. Note that for reasons discussed in Section 4.1, DUD-E was excluded from this analysis.\n\nThere is a moderate correlation between AOR and \u2206 logodds-mean-AUC (r 2 = .33); we note that this correlation is not present when we use \u2206 mean-AUC as the y-coordinate (r 2 = .09). We hypothesize that some portion of the multitask effect is determined by shared active compounds. That is, a dataset is most likely to benefit from multitask training when it shares many active compounds with other datasets in the collection. Figure 6. Multitask improvement compared to active occurrence rate (AOR). Each point in the figure represents a particular dataset Di. The x-coordinate is the mean AOR across all active compounds in Di, and the y-coordinate is the difference in log-oddsmean-AUC between multitask and single-task models. The gray bars indicate standard deviations around the AOR means. There is a moderate correlation (r 2 = .33). For reasons discussed in Section 4.1, we excluded DUD-E from this analysis. (Including DUD-E results in a similar correlation, r 2 = .22.) Figure 7 shows the relationship between multitask improvement and target classes. As before, we report multitask improvement in terms of log-odds and exclude the DUD-E datasets. Qualitatively, no target class benefited more than any other from multitask training. Nearly every target class realized gains, suggesting that the multitask framework is applicable to experimental data from multiple target classes.\n\n\nTARGET CLASSES\n\n\nDUPLICATE TARGETS\n\nAs mentioned in Section 3.1, there are many cases of tasks with identical targets. We compared the multitask improvement of duplicate vs. unique tasks. The distributions have substantial overlap (see the Appendix), but the average logodds improvement was slightly higher for duplicated tasks (.531 vs. .372; a one-sided t-test between the duplicate and unique distributions gave p = .016). Since duplicated targets are likely to share many active compounds, this improvement is consistent with the correlation seen in Sec- Figure 7. Multitask improvement across target classes. The xcoordinate lists a series of biological target classes represented in our dataset collection, and the y-coordinate is the difference in log-odds-mean-AUC between multitask and single-task models. Note that the DUD-E datasets are excluded. Classes are ordered by total number of targets (in parenthesis), and target classes with fewer than five members are merged into \"miscellaneous.\" tion 4.5.1. However, sign tests for single-task vs. multitask models for duplicate and unique targets gave significant and highly overlapping confidence intervals ([0.04, 0.24] and [0.06, 0.17], respectively; recall that the meaning of these intervals is given in the caption for Table 2). Together, these results suggest that there is not significant information leakage within multitask networks. Consequently, the results of our analysis are unlikely to be significantly affected by the presence of duplicate targets in our dataset collection.\n\n\nDiscussion and Conclusion\n\nIn this work, we investigated the use of massively multitask networks for virtual screening. We gathered a large collection of publicly available experimental data that we used to train massively multitask neural networks. These networks achieved significant improvement over simple machine learning algorithms.\n\nWe explored several aspects of the multitask framework. First, we demonstrated that multitask performance improved with the addition of more tasks; our performance was still climbing at 259 tasks. Next, we considered the relative importance of introducing more data vs. more tasks. We found that additional data and additional tasks both contributed significantly to the multitask effect. We next discovered that multitask learning afforded limited transferability to tasks not contained in the training set. This effect was not universal, and required large amounts of data even when it did apply.\n\nWe observed that the multitask effect was stronger for some datasets than others. Consequently, we investigated possible explanations for this discrepancy and found that the presence of shared active compounds was moderately correlated with multitask improvement, but the biological class of the target was not. It is also possible that multitask improvement results from accurately modeling experimental artifacts rather than specific interactions between targets and small molecules. We do not believe this to be the case, as we demonstrated strong improvement on the thoroughlycleaned MUV datasets.\n\nThe efficacy of multitask learning is directly related to the availability of relevant data. Hence, obtaining greater amounts of data is of critical importance for improving the state of the art. Major pharmaceutical companies possess vast private stores of experimental measurements; our work provides a strong argument that increased data sharing could result in benefits for all.\n\nMore data will maximize the benefits achievable using current architectures, but in order for algorithmic progress to occur, it must be possible to judge the performance of proposed models against previous work. It is disappointing to note that all published applications of deep learning to virtual screening (that we are aware of) use distinct datasets that are not directly comparable. It remains to future research to establish standard datasets and performance metrics for this field.\n\nAnother direction for future work is the further study of small molecule featurization. In this work, we use only one possible featurization (ECFP4), but there exist many others. Additional performance may also be realized by considering targets as well as small molecules in the featurization. Yet another line of research could improve performance by using unsupervised learning to explore much larger segments of chemical space.\n\nAlthough deep learning offers interesting possibilities for virtual screening, the full drug discovery process remains immensely complicated. Can deep learning-coupled with large amounts of experimental data-trigger a revolution in this field? Considering the transformational effect that these methods have had on other fields, we are optimistic about the future. . We note that the DUD-E datasets are especially susceptible to \"artificial enrichment\" (unrealistic divisions between active and inactive compounds) as an artifact of the dataset construction procedure. Each data point in our collection was associated with a binary label classifying it as either active or inactive.\n\nA description of each of our 259 datasets is given in Table A1. These datasets cover a wide range of target classes and assay types, including both cell-based and in vitro experiments. Datasets with duplicated targets are marked with an asterisk (note that only the non-DUD-E duplicate target datasets were used in the analysis described in the text). For the PCBA datasets, compounds not labeled \"Active\" were considered inactive (including compounds marked \"Inconclusive\"). Due to missing data in PubChem BioAssay and/or featurization errors, some data points and compounds were not used for evaluation of our models; failure rates for each dataset group are shown in Table A.2. The Tox21 group suffered especially high failure rates, likely due to the relatively large number of metallic or otherwise abnormal compounds that are not supported by the RDKit package. The counts given in Table A1 do not include these missing data. A graphical breakdown of the datasets by target class is shown in Figure A.1. The datasets used for the held-in and held-out analyses are repeated in Table A.3  and Table A.4, respectively.\n\nAs an extension of our treatment of task similarity in the text, we generated the heatmap in Figure A.2 to show the pairwise intersection between all datasets in our collection. A few characteristics of our datasets are immediately apparent:\n\n\u2022 The datasets in the DUD-E group have very little intersection with any other datasets.\n\n\u2022 The PCBA and Tox21 datasets have substantial self-overlap. In contrast, the MUV datasets have relatively little self-overlap.\n\n\u2022 The MUV datasets have substantial overlap with the datasets in the PCBA group.\n\n\u2022 The Tox21 datasets have very small intersections with datasets in other groups.      (McGill et al., 1978). Occasionally the notch limits go beyond the quartile markers, producing a \"folded down\" effect on the boxplot. Paired t-tests (2-sided) relative to the PMTNN across all non-DUD-E datasets gave p \u2264 1.86 \u00d7 10 \u221215 .\n\n\nB. Performance metrics\n\n\nC. Training Details\n\nThe multitask networks in Table 2 were trained with learning rate .0003 and batch size 128 for 50M steps using stochastic gradient descent. Weights were initialized from a zero-mean Gaussian with standard deviation .01. The bias was initialized at .5. We experimented with higher learning rates, but found that the pyramidal networks sometimes failed to train (the top hidden layer zeroed itself out). However, this effect vanished with the lower learning rate. Most of the models were trained with 64 simultaneous replicas sharing their gradient updates, but in some cases we used as many as 256.\n\nThe pyramidal single-task networks were trained with the same settings, but for 100K steps. The vanilla single-task networks were trained with learning rate .001 for 100K steps. The networks used in Figure 3 and Figure 4 were trained with learning rate 0.003 for 500 epochs plus a constant 3 million steps. The constant factor was introduced after we observed that the smaller multitask networks required more epochs than the larger networks to stabilize.\n\nThe networks in Figure 5 were trained with a Pyramidal (1000, 50) Single Task architecture (matching the networks in Figure 3). The weights were initialized with the weights from the networks represented in Figure 3 and then trained for 100K steps with a learning rate of 0.0003.\n\nAs we noted in the main text, the datasets in our collection contained many more inactive than active compounds. To ensure the actives were given adequate importance during training, we weighted the actives for each dataset to have total weight equal to the number of inactives for that dataset (inactives were given unit weight).  \n\n\nPreliminary work.

As in Figure 2, we added randomly selected tasks (xaxis) to a fixed held-in set. A stratified random sampling scheme was applied to the additional tasks in order to achieve fixed total numbers of additional input examples (color, line type). White points indicate the mean over 10 experimental runs of \u2206 mean-AUC over the initial network trained on the 10 held-in datasets. Color-filled areas and error bars describe the smoothed 95% confidence intervals.\n\nFigure 5\n5Figure 5. Held-out growth curves.
