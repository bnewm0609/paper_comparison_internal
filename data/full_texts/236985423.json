When leveraging a dataset for anomaly detection, both a normal dataset and an abnormal dataset should be provided for learning and evaluation. Without an abnormal dataset that includes attack-related data, it cannot be evaluated whether it trains properly or detects anomalies. Such a dataset is helpful for research on the following areas: development of data-driven defense Permission to make digital or hard copies of all or part of this work for personal or classroom use is granted without fee provided that copies are not made or distributed for profit or commercial advantage and that copies bear this notice and the full citation on the first page.

The generation and reproduction of a sequence of attacks and their inclusion in the dataset are always a significant concern. In particular, three aspects are mainly considered when creating various attack situations for dataset development:\n\n\u2022 Reproducibility: To design an attack sequence suitable for the purpose of the dataset and implement it through automation, an integrated representation that can reproduce the attack sequence is required because the representation allows to explain the abnormal dataset information. \u2022 Diversity: Some attacks are possible through the use of fragmented information obtained from security threat cases and attack reports. However, it is not appropriate to create a sequence by simply enumerating or reordering attacks because generating a large number of attack sequences with specific requirements (enumerating or reordering) is difficult. Therefore, a model that can reflect more diverse attack sequences is needed. \u2022 Reality: How realistic a generated attack sequence is should be expressed. The reality of an attack sequence can be used to check whether it meets the user purpose or to evaluate the performance of the attack detection system.\n\nAlthough various studies on the method of generating attack sequences have been conducted, the purpose of the study and method has limitations in terms of dataset generation mentioned above. Several studies have also been conducted to envision the attacker's behavior according to its type [8,9,34]. However, only limited information is used to generate an attack sequence or evaluate the attacker's behavior at the network level. For adversary emulation, some studies have suggested a method of generating an attack sequence based on the pre-condition and post-condition of the attacker's behavior [20,36]. Nevertheless, such a method is suitable for reproducing the attack sequence due to its detailed host level, but it lacks a high-level view that can compare similarities with specific attacks that have already occurred or check the possibility of individual attacks.\n\nHence, for creating a dataset, attack cases were analyzed from the viewpoint of MITRE ATT&CK and an attack sequence was generated based on self-defined rules [31]. However, because this method randomly generates attack scenarios based on rules, there is a scenario reality issue. In addition, another method was also presented to manually infer the attack strategy and method used in the competition dataset based on MITRE ATT&CK through the existing dataset rather than the dataset creation [21]. This method Figure 1: Proposed method to generate and execute attack sequences for the dataset is a reverse analysis for a technique that infers the attack sequence from the provided dataset. The method for testing MITRE ATT&CK was presented, but the method considered a every single attack module rather than how to generate an attack sequence as multiple attacks for a diverse dataset [35]. The feasibility of these related works is challenging for our purpose: developing diverse dataset to benefit from generating and reproducing attack sequence.\n\nTo overcome the three difficulties in developing the ICS dataset, we implemented an attack sequence generation method based on the hidden Markov model (HMM), which is fairly capable of representing MITRE ATT&CK. Fig. 1 shows the structure diagram for proposed method to generate and execute attack sequences for the dataset. First, the attack sequence generator produces the attack sequence based on MITRE ATT&CK using probabilities as input: transition probability between tactics and the emission probability of the technique from the tactic. The characteristics of the proposed attack sequence scheme are as follows:\n\n\u2022 Representable attack sequence: By adopting tactics and techniques based on MITRE ATT&CK as an attack sequence representation, attack sequence information from related incident reports can be expressed. \u2022 Probabilistic attack sequence: Various attack sequences can be automatically generated by expressing the order of occurrence and probabilities of tactics and techniques in the HMM. We introduce methods to generate various attack sequences through three case studies. \u2022 Practical attack sequence: We analyzed the existing ICS incident reports to determine the probability, which is a parameter used in HMM. By adjusting the order and probability of each tactic and technique, the probability of occurrence between the generated attack sequences can be compared for the user purpose: an initial tactic, a specific attack inclusion or exclusion, etc.). The transition probability determines the order of the individual attacks constituting the attack sequence. Namely, the order of individual attacks can vary by adjusting this probability.\n\nLastly, the attack sequence executor performs the sequence generated from the attack profile, of which information is required as a user input to execute each technique. We are developing the attack sequence executor with the Purple Team ATT&CK Automation 1 module, which can automatically emulate MITRE ATT&CK tactics and techniques through Metasploit.\n\nWe used a HAI testbed that had a target to reproduce the attack sequence and was able to collect data related to it. HAI testbed includes real ICSs widely used in critical infrastructure, operating components such as engineering workstation (EWS) and humanmachine interface (HMI), and a log server that collects data generated in the testbed. Accordingly, a dataset can be obtained from the HAI testbed environment [6,7,23,24].\n\nThe remainder of this paper is organized as follows: Section 2 describes the MITRE ATT&CK referenced for creating an attack sequence. Section 3 describes the method we proposed for creating an attack sequence. Section 4 introduces the process of attack sequence reproduction. Section 5 presents the preliminary results of the attack sequence generated according to the user's purpose. Finally, Section 6 concludes the work and discusses the scope of future research.\n\n\nBACKGROUND: MITRE ATT&CK FOR ICSS\n\nMITRE ATT&CK for ICSs (hereinafter referred to as ATT&CK for ICSs) compiled security threats related to control systems from the viewpoint of an attacker. ATT&CK for ICSs established components such as tactics, techniques, and data sources by referring to attack cases targeting actual control systems and analysis reports issued by related organizations such as the SANS Institute, Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), and National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) [2].\n\nATT&CK for ICSs 2 constructed a matrix by mapping a total of 96 types (81 types when excluding duplicates) with 11 types of tactics. The tactics of ATT&CK for ICSs are inherited from ATT&CK for enterprise excluding \"Privilege Escalation, \" \"Credential Access, \" and \"Exfiltration. \" [28] New tactics specialized in the control system operating environment, i.e., \"Inhibit Response Function\" and \"Impair Process Control, \" were added. As shown in Fig. 3 \n\n\nATTACK SEQUENCE GENERATOR\n\nWe define an attack sequence as representing the execution order of techniques. When we create a set of attack sequences required to be differently generated as varying user objectives, ATT&CK for ICSs is feasible to reflect user requirements. ATT&CK for ICSs provides a framework that can express various attacks: existing incident cases and security threats. \n\n\nProposed Method\n\nWe proposed the method of generating attack sequences using the HMM to represent user purpose. We leverage the first-order HMM 3 as shown in Fig. 2, which can explain the characteristics of this adversary behavior based on ATT&CK for ICSs, and the assumptions can be replaced as follows [22]:\n\n\u2022 The tactic (x t ) used by the attacker at the current time (t) is only affected by the tactic (x t \u22121 ) used by the previous (t \u2212 1). (i.e., Markovian property) \u2022 The technique (y t ) observed at the current time (t) is affected only by the tactic (x t ) at the current time (t). When the HMM is applied to ATT&CK for ICSs, a set of tactics is involved (11 states, S), and a set of attack technologies (81 observations, O) can occur from each tactic. The following parameters are used as the input values of the HMM:\n\n\u2022 Initial state probability (\u03c0 ): probability of starting each tactic \u2022 Transition probability (T ): probability of movement between each tactic \u2022 Emission probability (E): probability of the occurrence of the technique included in each tactic From the perspective of ATT&CK for ICSs, the adversary executes an attack in the direction of \"Impact\" from \"Initial Access\" tactic to compromise a target. When an attack sequence is expressed, the state and observation based on the HMM can be interpreted as follows: First, because the \"Impact\" state is the final stage targeted by the attacker, transition to another state is not probable. In other words, once the final state is reached, the single attack sequence is considered complete. Second, depending on the failure or reuse of the technique at the current stage, multiple techniques can be used within the same tactic or the same technique can be retried. We represent this situation as a self-transition. Finally, to consider an attack sequence where the final tactic 'Impact' is not reached, the length of the sequence (i.e., the number of state transitions, including the initial state) can be limited. Unless the final state does reach \"Impact,\" it is regarded as an attack sequence in which the attackers failed to achieve their purpose. \n\n\nGenerating Attack Sequence\n\nThe HMM can generate various attack sequences with its parameters. To provide HMM parameters, we analyzed not only actual ICS incidents and threats reports but also ICS vulnerabilities papers shown in Table 1. Based on the analysis results, we calculated the frequency of transition between each tactic and the frequency of observed technique according to the tactic as a probability. We aggregated each probability to derive the initial probability, transition probability, and emission probability. In particular, Table 2 show the emission probability calculated from ICS incident materials as mentioned at Table 1. By adjusting the three probabilities of the HMM parameters, it is possible to create an attack sequence reflecting on the user purpose, such as which tactic to start from and which tactic and technique to be included instead of human-generated attack sequences. Moreover, we can also generate a set of different attack sequences without changing value of parameters because the HMM is a probabilistic model. The generated attack sequence is arranged by techniques in ATT&CK for ICSs, and its length depends on the total number of transitions for tactics as the user desired.\n\n\nATTACK SEQUENCE EXECUTOR 4.1 Attack Profile for Execution\n\nTo reproduce attack sequences, we organized an attack profile, of which information required to execute each technique constituting the attack sequence. First, information on the attacker executing the attack technique and the victim targeting the attack is required.\n\nSecond, time information is necessary so that the technique is sequentially performed according to the timeline. Finally, various options should be defined in advance, such as commands and file paths to be used when performing the technique. The attack sequence executor can reproduce the attack by sequence with the attack profile for the pre-configuration and scheduling. Because the attack profile must be configured according to the technique within the attack sequence, a problem may arise, such that the user-defined input range is also increased as the attack sequence lengthens. In this case, the attack execution time information and attacker and victim information, excluding information commonly used for the attack technique, can be assigned in chronological order or automated selection method through the attacker and victim candidates in the test environment.\n\n\nExecution Tool\n\nWe reproduce the attack based on ATT&CK for ICSs with the Purple Team ATT&CK Automation module. In addition, we are currently developing an attack reproducing the automation tool based on Metasploit's msfrpc to facilitate attack reproduction and create a dataset through various and long-term replays of attacks in the future. The main purpose of this tool is to emulate generated attack sequence for developing a dataset. The execution tool can perform an attack to HAI testbed by referring to the attack profile, which is predefined configuration information. We will leverage the attack profile for dataset label generation when collecting datasets by reproducing attack sequences.\n\n\nCASE STUDY: ATTACK SEQUENCE GENERATION\n\nThe proposed attack sequence generation method can be applied according to various use case; First, a realistic attack sequence similar to the actual threat can be created using the parameters derived from the analysis results of the attack case of the existing control system. Second, the user can create an attack sequence while filtering for a specific purpose. Users can exclude specific attack strategies or attack techniques by changing parameters. Similarly, when a user reflects only a specific attack case in a parameter, the sequence similar to a specific attack type can be created. Finally, users can create random attack sequences by randomly setting parameters while complying with HMM probability properties. In the following subsections, we arranged the preliminary results for the attack sequence generated through the HMM according to the case. The total number of attack attempts was set to 20 for all cases.\n\n\nCase I: Sequence for All ICS Incidents\n\nBased on the analysis according to Table 1, we calculated the frequency of transition between each tactic and the frequency of the observed technique according to the tactic as a probability. We aggregated each probability to derive the initial probability, transition probability, and emission probability as the HMM parameters. Fig. 4 at Appendix C.1 represents a graph created by reflecting the HMM parameters of the initial probability, transition probability (black solid line), and emission probability (blue solid line). Applying all emission probabilities to each state is difficult to check because almost all observations are generated, so only the observations emitted from \"TA0007 (Collection)\" are shown in the graph as an example. In addition, the emission probability according to state is provided in Table 2 at Appendix B. A sequence similar to an actual attack was created based on the HMM parameters derived from the ICS incident reports. The attack sequence differed from the initial attack strategy according to the initial probability. In particular, it was divided into an attack success sequence and an attack failure sequence due to the limited number of attack attempts as shown in Fig. 5 and Fig. 6 at Appendix C.1.\n\n\nCase II: Sequence for Specific ICS Incidents\n\nWe can create an attack sequence while filtering for a specific purpose. For this, we adjusted the HMM parameters for Triton malware discovered in Saudi Arabia, which was reported as a various attack techniques as shown in Fig. 7 at Appendix C.2. Although the actual attack sequence of Triton and the attack sequence automatically generated through the HMM are not identically equal, Triton similarly generated the flow of tactic and attack technique performed in each tactic as shown in Fig. 8 at Appendix C.3.\n\n\nCase III: Evaluation for Possible Sequence\n\nUsing the HMM's forward algorithm addressed in Appendix D, we evaluated the randomly generated attack sequence by calculating the likelihood of a given sequence of techniques. We evaluated the Triton-like attack sequence automatically generated through the HMM and randomly generated attack sequence. Based on the evaluation results, the Triton-like attack sequence was calculated as 2.616e-09, and the random attack sequence was calculated as zero. The likelihood represents the product of the transition probability between attack sequences, which is zero even if one of the transitions has zero probability. Therefore, the probability of a random attack sequence appearing is zero or can be used as an indicator to determine whether a realistic sequence is based on a specific value. To calculate the probability of a realistic attack, the method of calculating the probability of the current attack sequence can also be improved. For example, the probability of individual tactics and techniques may have to reflect changes depending on the situation as increasing the probability for the technique that occurred once.\n\n\nCONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK\n\nIn this paper, we proposed an automatic attack sequence generation method based on the HMM to generate a dataset including various attack situations. We determined HMM parameters by referring to an actual case analysis and ATT&CK for ICSs to create a realistic control system attack sequence. An attack sequence was also created by filtering attack strategies and attack techniques for a user-specific purpose through parameter tuning, and an evaluation plan for an arbitrary attack sequence created by a user was also presented. Although the proposed method cannot accurately modeled and manually evolving attack patterns due to probabilistic model, this method allows to create similarly attack sequence from the viewpoint of diverse dataset. In the future, we will supplement the proposed method to generate normal and abnormal scenarios in the HAI testbed when developing a dataset, of which all areas of the ICSs from level 0 to level 2 are covered.    \n\n\nA MITRE ATT&CK MATRIX FOR ICS\n\u03b1 t (j) = n i=1 \u03b1 t \u22121 (i)a i j b j (o t )(1)\n\u2022 \u03b1 t \u22121 (i) : previous forward path probability from the previous time step \u2022 a i j : transition probability from previous state q i to current state q j \u2022 b j (o t ) : state observation likelihood of the observation symbol o t given the current state j\n\n\nCSET '21, August 9, 2021, Virtual, CA, USA \u00a9 2021 Association for Computing Machinery.
