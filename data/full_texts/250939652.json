Alternatively, gas consumption has to be replaced with increased coal consumption, extra installation of renewables, and replacement of gas boilers with heat-pumps. SUMMARY Russia is the largest contributor of gas to Europe. It supplied 34% of the EU27 + GB gas consumption in 2019. Due to Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine, these imports may be discontinued, challenging Europe\u2019s energy supply. Here, we investigate the subsequent medium- to long-term implications of gas scarcity on the European green transition. Short-term implications are discussed, but not analyzed. Using an open-sector-coupled model of the European energy system, we show that faster integration of heat pumps and renewables is neces-sary to maintain climate ambitions, while additional biomass and the postponed phaseout of coal is cost-optimal to ensure energy secu-rity. We analyze transition pathways based on CO 2 budgets corresponding to 1.5 (cid:1) C and 2 (cid:1) C of temperature increase. We \ufb01nd that the 1.5 (cid:1) C pathway quickly relieves Europe\u2019s dependency on imported gas but relies on high build-out rates and has high investment costs. In the 2 (cid:1) C pathway, gas and electricity prices are more affected by the uncertainty in gas supply. long-term consequences of reduced gas availability in Europe. We present four scenarios for the transition of the European energy supply that have either an ambitious goal targeting a global temperature increase below 1.5 (cid:1) C or a more moderate goal targeting a temperature increase below 2 (cid:1) C. The available CO 2 budgets are 25.7 and 73.9 Gt CO 2 cumulative to 2050 for the 1.5 (cid:1) C and 2 (cid:1) C, respectively. 23 Maximum CO 2 emissions in every time step are determined based on the carbon budgets, assuming an exponential decay and carbon neutrality by 2050.

Our study investigates the implications of reducing gas consumption in Europe and finds that by following ambitious climate goals, reliance on gas is naturally alleviated. Alternatively, gas consumption has to be replaced with increased coal consumption, extra installation of renewables, and replacement of gas boilers with heat-pumps.\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nFossil gas has been regarded as a key transition fuel that could help bridge the gap between the present day and a carbon-neutral future. Though carbon-emitting, gas has the following advantages compared with other fossil fuels: gas power plants have lower capital costs, 1 , 2 lower CO 2 -equivalent emissions when burned, 3 , 4 and generators have quick ramp-up times. 1 The European Commission has even labeled gas activities as contributing to the green transition. 5 For these reasons, numerous studies of highly renewable energy systems keep gas as the only conventional form of power generation [6][7][8][9][10] or otherwise phase it out last. 11 , 12 However, as a fossil fuel, gas must still be eliminated during the transition. In addition, the savings of CO 2 -equivalent emissions from gas over other fossil fuels may be overstated or non-existent due to the leakage of methane during extraction, distribution, processing, and end use. 13 Nations must wean themselves off of gas by 2050 in order to comply with the Paris Agreement. For the European Union (EU), this is no easy task. In 2019, gas made up 21% of final energy consumption, 14 including 43% of residential use and 35% of industrial energy use. 15 , 16 Gas in Europe is primarily imported, with 70% coming from outside of Europe 14 when counting Norwegian gas as internal production. The current energy supply in Europe has a particularly strong dependence on Russian imports. Out of the 398 bcm (3,890 TWh) of gas imported by the EU in 2019 (EU27 + GB), 17 41% 18 had Russian origin ( Figure 1). On top of that, 27% and 47% of oil and coal imports in 2019 came from Russia, respectively.\n\n\nContext & scale\n\nThe European energy sector relies on gas as a key resource to provide electricity and heating for domestic and industrial consumers. Reliance on gas is expected to continue through 2050, as Europe considers gas a bridging technology capable of providing electricity and heating at reduced emission levels compared with other fossil fuels. Europe imports roughly 34% of its gas from Russia, but this may stop due to the Russian invasion of Ukraine. In this study, we investigate how a significant reduction in natural gas imports affects the energy supply of Europe through 2050. We find that a combination of replacing gas boilers with heat pumps, continued use of coal, faster installation of wind turbines and photovoltaic panels, and biomass make up for the lack of Russian gas. In addition, we find that Europe's climate goals have a stronger impact on the system cost and configuration than disallowing the use of Russian gas. In short, ambitious climate action reinforces energy security.\n\nThe Russian invasion of Ukraine could result in the discontinuation of the gas supply from Russia, which could have significant consequences for the EU's energy transition. At the time of writing, the European Commission has presented the REPowerEU strategy, including the goal of reducing gas imports from Russia by two-thirds by the end of 2022. 19 Given the large share of Russian gas in Europe today, a discontinuation of gas imports could challenge the European transition to net-zero emissions. With this in mind, we investigate the following research questions. How does the optimum transition path for Europe change when the availability of gas is severely limited? Which technologies does the model favor to compensate for gas scarcity? How much more expensive will it be for the system to reach its 2030 and 2050 goals in accordance with the Paris Agreement? In the analysis of these questions, we focus on a case where all gas from Russia is removed from the system because we perceive this to be the most realistic worst-case scenario. Scenarios allowing for significant expansion of liquefied natural gas (LNG) imports are considered to validate the robustness of our findings. In contrast, we do not consider a large expansion of internal gas production, including gas fields in Norway, as these sources combined can only be expected to provide an extra 10 bcm per year. 20 The main novelty of our work is the use of a highly resolved, networked energy system model of all European energy sectors to study the impact of the reduced availability of gas. To our knowledge, the medium-to long-term impact on the European energy transition caused by reduced gas availability has not previously been studied.\n\nAlready experienced consequences to the European energy system beyond the potential cessation of Russian gas imports are also worth discussing. First, the completed Nord Stream 2 pipeline was denied certification by Germany. This pipeline would have doubled the gas transport capacity between Russia and Germany to 110 bcm per year, increasing Germany's reliance on Russian gas in the short term. 21 Second, the Ukrainian power system, previously synchronized with Russia and other former Soviet economies, was isolated as the war began. Existing plans to synchronize Ukraine and Moldova with the European network (ENTSO-E) in 2023 were speeded up and became effective in March 2022. 22 Using the sector-coupled energy system optimization model PyPSA-Eur-Sec, 9 we perform myopic optimization in 5-year steps from 2025 to 2050 to investigate the Figure 1. Overview of historic European gas demand (A) European gas demand in 2019. 14 (B) Gas import origin. 14 (C) Gas consumption by sector in 2015. 16 long-term consequences of reduced gas availability in Europe. We present four scenarios for the transition of the European energy supply that have either an ambitious goal targeting a global temperature increase below 1.5 C or a more moderate goal targeting a temperature increase below 2 C. The available CO 2 budgets are 25.7 and 73.9 Gt CO 2 cumulative to 2050 for the 1.5 C and 2 C, respectively. 23 Maximum CO 2 emissions in every time step are determined based on the carbon budgets, assuming an exponential decay and carbon neutrality by 2050. Using the two ambition levels, we define a reference scenario with an unbounded gas supply and a scenario where the gas supply is limited to today's levels, minus the share of gas currently imported from Russia. The EU27 + GB gas consumption in 2019 was 4,700 TWh 17 of which 1,600 TWh originated from Russian imports; 18 thus, we limit gas available to the system to 3,100 TWh. The PyPSA-Eur-Sec model presented in Victoria et al., 23 spanning 33 countries within the ENTSO-E, comprises the electricity, heating, land transport, aviation, and shipping sectors as well as the industrial sector, including feedstocks. The model includes a detailed representation of the electricity transmission grid and a copper-plate transport model for natural gas. Furthermore, detailed accounting for CO 2 -emissions, carbon capture, utilizations, and sequestration (CCUS) is implemented. The effect of building renovation is incorporated as exogenous efficiency improvements. Demand-side elasticity and shortterm substitution elasticity are not considered in the model. Behavioral changes could ease the consequence of reduced gas availability, in particular, reduced demand for energy services that are directly coupled to the use of gas such as lowering the indoor temperature of households heated by gas boilers.\n\nConstraining the gas availability to 3,100 TWh while keeping the demand for energy services constant represents a worst-case scenario where gas imports from Russia cannot be replaced by gas imports from other countries. The availability and cost of coal, lignite, and oil are assumed to remain unchanged in the base scenarios, but sensitivity to these parameters is discussed.\n\nIn contrast to the natural gas pipeline supply, replacing Russian oil and coal in the short term is challenging, but existing shipping networks can more easily redirect a global supply with help from targeted policy such as the Trans-Atlantic Energy Pact between North America and Europe. 24 In the medium-to long-term, vast electrification of the transport sector is expected to relieve the pressure from a Russian oil shortage, while the global coal market would replace Russian coal, albeit at a higher cost.\n\n\nRESULTS AND DISCUSSION\n\nPrimary energy supply Figure 2 shows the primary energy consumption in the four modeled scenarios. The total energy demand decreases with time due to assumed efficiency improvements from maturing technologies and building retrofitting, as well as an increase in system efficiency from replacing fossil fuel power plants with renewable technologies comprised of wind turbines and solar photovoltaic (PV). This phenomenon can be explained by the high exergy of electricity compared with fuels, as discussed by Luderer et al. 12 In Figure 2A, we observe a rapid phaseout of gas in the 1.5 C base scenario despite unrestricted gas availability. In contrast, in Figure 2B, the gas usage in the 2 C scenario remains high through 2045. Gas use even shows a slight increase, peaking in 2030 with a consumption of 4,780 TWh. The difference in gas consumption between the base and gas-limited scenarios is shown for the 1.5 C and 2 C scenarios in Figures 2E and 2F. National gas consumption for the base and gas-limited scenarios for selected countries is shown in Figures S19-S22. We observe that this difference is most pronounced given the 2 C carbon budget. For this carbon budget, the system would like to use gas as a ''transition fuel'' through 2045, but it is restricted.\n\nTo compensate for limited gas availability, the 2 C gas-limited scenario installs more renewables, heat pumps, and biomass, and delays coal and lignite phaseout to 2040. Additional renewables and the installation of heat pumps are each expected to replace roughly 500 TWh of gas consumption. More wind than solar energy is , and 2 C gas limited (D). Ambient heat refers to the energy utilized by the heat pump, e.g., from the ground or air. Historical primary energy consumption for 2019 is shown in the first bar using data from Eurostat. 14 (E and F) Gas consumption and technologies substituting missing gas (the colored areas above the dashed line) are shown for the 1.5 C (E) and 2 C (F) scenarios. The amount of energy used to replace missing gas might be either slightly higher or lower due to differences in the energy supply efficiency, e.g., the lower efficiency of coal power plants compared with gas turbines. Primary energy of renewable sources is determined as the electricity produced by them, while primary energy of fossil-fuel needs to be multiplied by their efficiency to determine the electricity production. (G and H) Cumulative renewable capacities are shown in (G) and (H); for more detail, see Figure S9.\n\nadded because in the limited gas scenario, additional electricity is required in winter to cover the heating demand, and wind seasonality correlates well with heating demand. In contrast, the only major difference between the 1.5 C base and gas-limited scenario occurs in 2025, the first modeled year, with only marginal differences every year thereafter.\n\nIt would be natural to assume that the production of synthetic gases such as methane and upgraded biogas would increase when fossil gas imports are limited. However, this is not the case in any of the cost-optimal scenarios, except hydrogen produced from electrolysis at 2 C (Figures S11 and S14). The reason why synthetic gas production is not affected is that electrification in the form of, e.g., heat pumps, represents a more cost-effective replacement of the missing gas. Synthetic fuels, on the other hand, are generally used to cover energy services that are most difficult to electrify.\n\nCarbon capture remains mostly unaffected by the gas limit and the additional CO 2 emitted by increased use of coal to produce electricity ( Figure S17). Especially in the 2 C scenario, additional emission from coal use is balanced by a corresponding increase in electricity generation from renewable sources and the use of more energy efficiency technologies such as heat pumps. For the 1.5 C scenario, the model finds it cost-optimal to capture around 800 Mt/CO 2 annually. CO 2 is captured mostly from process emissions, biomass, and gas used in industry. The 1.5 C-path also includes substantial direct air capture (DAC) ( Figure S17). The potential for CO 2 sequestration in the model is limited to a conservative assumption of 200 MtCO 2 /a (slightly above process emissions in the system). 23 Nuclear capacities are not affected by the gas limit and only marginally by the level of climate ambition, resulting in 19 GW of new nuclear installation in the 1.5 C scenario ( Figure S10). Furthermore, a slight increase in utilization ratio for existing plants is observed when gas is limited. In the model, no limits are imposed on the expansion of nuclear capacities, but systems based on renewables offer a lower total cost.\n\n\nHeat supply\n\nIn Figure 3, the provision of heating for domestic, service, and industrial sectors is depicted by technology, including historical data from 2019. Higher reliance on heat pumps is seen in gas-limited scenarios. Compared with the base 2 C scenario, we find that more than twice heat pump (cumulative) capacity is needed by 2025, with 192 GW instead of 83 GW ( Figure S12). We see a fast ramp-up of heat-pump capacities in both 1.5 C scenarios, overtaking gas as the main heat source by 2030 and peaking at 556 GW installed capacity by 2035. In contrast, the 2 C scenario has a delayed ramp-up where heat pumps do not become the main heat source until 2050.\n\nSimilar to the primary energy supply, we find a larger difference in technology mix between gas-limited and base scenarios for the 2 C budget compared with the 1.5 C budget. This is predominantly due to heat pumps, but oil boilers and central biomass plants also help to substitute for gas boilers in both gas-limited scenarios. In the 2 C scenario, oil boilers retain the same level of heat supply from 2025 to 2035, whereas they phase out in the 1.5 C scenarios. For the 1.5 C budget, the base scenario only shows gas consumption higher than the gas limitation in 2025, with marginal differences thereafter. In the 1.5 C scenarios, we see an additional endogenous heat demand from 2030 used to regenerate the sorbet in DAC installations, which become cost optimal from this year ( Figure S13). Waste heat from the Fischer-Tropsch process is not fully utilized, as this technology is operated with a ll high number of full load hours to recover its high capital cost, regardless of the heat demand ( Figure S15).\n\n\nGas, electricity, and CO 2 price\n\nIn this section, we investigate the key metrics of total annual system cost, average electricity price, gas price, CO 2 price, as well as the spatial distribution of added costs related to reducing gas reliance. We find that the limited gas availability has minimal impact on system cost for the 1.5 C scenario and a moderate impact for the 2 C scenario ( Figure 4A). The system cost for 1.5 C peaks in 2035 because the small carbon budget requires rapid decarbonization early in the transition, while the 2 C scenario only sees higher system prices in 2050; see also Victoria et al. 23 A C E B D F Figure 3. Heating supply to cover domestic, industry, and service sector demands (A-D) European heating supply to cover demand in domestic, industry, and service sectors for the two ambition levels with and without gas restrictions. Historical heating supply is based on 2019 European Union space heating by source from Odyssee-Mure. 25 (E and F) Capacities in units of thermal power are shown with dashed lines indicating gas-limited scenario. For this visualization, a coefficient of performance (COP) of 3 is assumed for heat pumps (in our model, heat pump capacity is given as electrical power, and the COP is temperature and source dependent). Solid black line indicates exogenous heat demand. Heat supply beyond this is due to additional endogenous heat demand for DAC. \n\n\nReport\n\nAverage electricity prices are shown in Figure 4B. For the 2 C scenario, limited gas availability causes prices to increase significantly from about 45 to 65 EUR/MWh in 2025 and remain at this level throughout the transition. The 1.5 C scenario also features high electricity prices, especially until 2035, but in this case, the price increase is driven by the level of climate ambition and not by gas scarcity.\n\nIn Figure 4C, the reference gas prices for the modeled scenarios are shown. A cost of 21.1 EUR/MWh for gas is assumed, similar to the price observed before 2021. When binding, the constraint on gas availability introduces an additional shadow price on gas, determined by the Lagrange/Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) multiplier associated with the gas limit constraint. In the 2 C scenario, the constraint is binding until 2040. As a result, the total gas price initially increases to approximately 85 EUR/MWh after which it gradually drops to the base level in 2045. The 1.5 C scenario, on the other hand, only experiences elevated gas prices in the first modeled period corresponding to 2025. Figure 4D shows very little difference in CO 2 price between the gas limited and unlimited scenarios. A small decrease in CO 2 price can be observed for the 2 C limited gas scenario because the high gas price drives part of the transition that is needed to meet the climate goals, e.g., the electrification of the heating sector.\n\nIn summary, across all four metrics shown in Figure 4, the impact of reducing reliance on gas is observed to have only minor impacts on the 1.5 C scenario, while creating substantial increases in electricity and gas prices in the 2 C scenario. This depicts a similar picture to that observed in Figure 2, where the utilization of gas as a transitional fuel is only observed in the 2 C scenario. Thus, having an ambitious climate target will not only lower climate impacts but also reduce the reliance on gas as a transitional fuel, decreasing the European energy system's dependence on imports of fossil fuels.\n\nThe impact of gas scarcity on individual countries is shown in Figure 4E by plotting the additional annual system cost when imposing the gas limit constraint in 2030 for the 2 C scenario. Uniformly across Europe, all countries increase investments in heat pumps to replace gas consumed to supply heat. We observe that countries with good wind resources, such as Denmark, Great Britain, and France, increase investments in wind power to compensate for the missing gas availability. In Italy and the Balkan countries, a large increase in costs related to coal power is observed, indicating that gas is replaced by additional coal use (Figure 4). The cost increases shown in Figure 4 are in absolute numbers. Analyzing the added costs relative to the size of the economies, the largest impacts are found in countries where gas is replaced by renewable energy ( Figure S18). It is also worth noting that the economic impact in countries such as Norway and Sweden is rather insignificant. Figure S20 shows the seasonal gas consumption in 2030 for the 2 C scenario for individual countries that strongly rely on natural gas to cover their energy demand. The system finds it optimal to discontinue the highest relative share in Italy and Spain (62%), whereas Germany is settled with a 41% annual reduction due to the imposed gas limitation. Current and projected European gas infrastructure shows that these countries, together with France, have the largest LNG terminal capacity (Germany currently does not have any operating capacity but is projected to have a terminal capacity of 30 bcm per year). 28 Furthermore, Germany and Italy currently have the largest stores of natural gas (245 and 197 TWh). 29 Here, results show that some of these resilient countries do not need to be the ones with the lowest reduction in gas consumption. South-eastern European countries without docks for LNG terminals, e.g., Hungary, could have difficulties retaining their gas consumption. In the results of this study, Hungary shows the smallest relative reduction (31%) compared with the remaining five depicted countries.\n\n\nSupply of energy in winter\n\nHighly renewable energy systems are challenged by dark doldrums (i.e., a week in winter in which solar and wind generation is low but electricity and heating demand is high). 9,11 We investigate the system operation throughout the most critical week of the year in which gas consumption in the 2 C gas-unlimited scenario is highest ( Figure 5). When unlimited, gas used in open cycle gas turbine (OCGT), combined ll Joule 6, 1566-1580, July 20, 2022 1573 Report cycle gas turbine (CCGT), and combined heat and power (CHP) units is the main source of electricity besides the renewable production. In the gas-limited scenario, a much higher proportion of renewable energy is shown, as well as an increase in coal and biomass. Battery storage now appears in the balancing during night. For the heating supply, gas is clearly the predominant source in both the baseline and gas-limited scenarios. In the latter, a fraction of the gas use is replaced with heat pumps. In addition, biomass CHP plants are now on par with or even surpass the gas CHP plants, while they were not present in the baseline scenario.\n\n\nSensitivity\n\nIn this section, we investigate the sensitivity to the coal price to determine whether the additional coal and lignite consumption in the gas-limited 2 C scenario is robust. So far, the assumed prices for coal and lignite are 8.15 EUR/MWh th and 2.9 EUR/ MWh th respectively. 30 As a comparison, following the invasion of Ukraine, the average coal price from April 2021 to March 2022 was 19.4 EUR/MWh, reaching peak prices of 37.4 EUR/MWh. 26 We find that the additional consumption of coal is robust up until twice our assumed fuel cost ( Figure S2). At the quadruple coal price increase, the gas restriction entails a reduced coal consumption in 2025 compared with the base case, but even here, coal is still phased out at a later stage. The delayed coal phaseout is noticeable up until the 10-fold coal price increase. In that case, coal consumption is reduced substantially due to the high cost.\n\nAn additional sensitivity analysis is run including the possibility of installing additional LNG regasification capacity in Europe (see supplemental information), which has access to gas at double cost of the reference 31 and investment costs of 100 million USD/bcm. 32 Under these assumptions, new LNG capacity is only installed  Figure S3). System cost is marginally reduced throughout the transition. This is also true after 2035 when LNG capacity becomes a stranded asset because this scenario reduces the more-expensive coal power capacity deployed (Figures S4 and S5). The LNG regasification capacity expansion is only cost optimal in the 1.5 C scenario when the coal price is four times higher than the reference. Regardless of the use of LNG, a delayed coal phaseout is also present ( Figure S6).\n\n\nGrowth rates\n\nThe PyPSA-Eur-Sec model used in this work does not constrain build-out rates of generation capacity. As there is significant uncertainty related to future build-out rates, we prefer not to limit the model in this way, allowing us to observe the preferred rates. The installation rate of renewables can be seen in Figure S8 and total annual change in primary energy consumption in Figure S7. It is clear that a transition of our energy supply requires significant build-out of renewable and heat-pump capacities. Results show installation rates of approximately 600 GW/a of wind and solar. These figures are naturally higher than any historical values. 33 However, this does not necessarily mean that achieving this transition is unfeasible. As wind and solar costs decrease, demand and production capacity will increase because these technologies already show lower costs than fossil fuel-based generators in most world regions. 34 Such a fast transition will require ambitious policies implemented globally, together with strategies that avoid regulatory bottlenecks and ensure public acceptance. Rather than focusing on the build-out required to attain the 1.5 C and 2 C scenarios, which has been extensively discussed previously, 23 we instead focus on the impact of reducing reliance on gas.\n\nReaching installation rates of 600 GW/a for solar and wind would require a growth rate exceeding historical levels. New EU solar installations in 2021 reached 25.9 GW, at a 34% growth rate over 2020. 35 If installation per annum exponentially grows at this rate for the next 9 years, Europe would install 360 GW of solar per year by 2030, which is approximately the amount of combined residential and utility solar required for the 1.5 C scenario ( Figure S8). This shows that solar must maintain historical growth rates for Europe to stay compatible with the 1.5 C scenarios. In contrast, wind installation rates would need to grow at faster than historical levels. 17.4 GW of wind was installed in Europe in 2021, 36 while the best year of growth of wind installation in the past decade was in 2019, with 27% growth compared with the previous year. 37 Extrapolating this would only reach 150 GW of installation by 2030, which is lower than the 220 GW of combined onshore and offshore wind called for in our model for the 1.5 C scenario ( Figure S8).\n\nIf achieving build-out rates in the order of 600 GW/a of wind and solar is in fact unfeasible, the energy system will have to compensate. The total amount of wind and solar power needed to fully decarbonize the European energy sector in a costoptimal manner does not change significantly with the climate ambition. As seen in Figure 2, the 2050 primary energy balances of the 1.5 C and 2 C scenarios are almost identical. Thus, having a lower build-out rate would result in a more gradual transition toward the required amount of renewables, but the final capacity would be very similar. Constraining the build-out rate of renewables naturally induces extra costs as the model is forced to make decisions it would not have made otherwise. In the 1.5 C scenario, a constraint on renewable build-out would force the model to rely on fossil-based energy generators for a longer period of time and compensate for the additional emissions, e.g., with negative emissions technology. Choosing to limit build-out rates would heavily impact the model's choice of energy transition paths. These dynamics are not captured in this work and are a limitation of the study performed. For detailed studies on the implication of limited build-out rates, refer to Cherp et al. and Grubb and Drummond. 33,38 Results show that limiting gas availability incentivizes early decarbonization of the energy supply. In both the 1.5 C and 2 C scenarios, we see higher build-out rates and a quicker initial ramp-up of renewables, allowing for a more gradual ramp-up through 2030. The impact on growth rates caused by reduced availability of gas compared with the impact of climate ambition is, however, small.\n\n\nShort-term implications\n\nWhile this paper focuses on the medium-to long-term consequences of cessation of Russian gas on the European energy system, we briefly discuss the immediate shortterm implications here. The International Energy Agency (IEA) 20 and the European Commission 19 have proposed several strategies to go through the next winter in Europe without importing Russian gas. These plans propose the following: delaying nuclear phaseout, speeding-up solar and wind deployment to compensate for production of electricity, rapidly deploying heat pumps to substitute gas for heating, accelerating energy efficiency improvements in buildings and industry, encouraging a temporary thermostat adjustment by consumers, and increasing coal use. 20 , 39 While most measures would support the energy transition and help Europe reach its climate goals, increasing coal consumption would deplete Europe's available carbon budget even further. Some proposals point at increasing LNG imports; reopening internal gas fields, such as Groningen in the Netherlands 40 ; or increasing biogas consumption in Denmark. 19 , 41 The European Commission expects that increased import of LNG combined with regasification can replace 50 bcm of the missing gas, equivalent to 485 TWh. 19 However, the existing unused LNG regasification terminals (mostly located in Spain) and intra-EU pipeline capacities, together with the small size of the global LNG market limit the potential of this strategy. As an indication of these limitations, the gas price in Europe reached 226 EUR/MWh in March 2022 (15 times higher than its average price in the period 2015-2021). The European Council also suggests that increased gas imports from countries other than Russia and increased domestic biogas production could supply an additional 18 bcm (175 TWh) of fossil/biogas. 19 Outlook In this section, we briefly compare this study with the plans presented by the European Commission, 19 the short-term plans presented by the IEA, 20 and Bruegel. 39 Rapid deployment of renewable technologies is identified as a key action in all plans. This supports the findings from our work, where we see renewables replacing large shares of energy previously supplied with gas. However, we differ in the extent to which renewables are installed. Although the European Commission aims to deploy 480 GW of wind capacities 19 and with the EU Solar Strategy 600 GW of solar by 2030, 42 we show much higher deployment rates for the ambitious 1.5 C scenario, requiring about 1 TW of additional capacity of each technology between 2025 and 2030. As discussed in Victoria et al., 23 the dramatic ramp-up required for solar and wind energy in the 1.5 C casts doubts on the feasibility of remaining below this carbon budget. The European Commission's plan is more aligned with our results in the 2 C scenario.\n\nAdditional heat pump capacities are also key. The European Commission expects that 10 million heat-pump units can be installed over the next 5 years. 19 Assuming an average heat pump unit capacity of 10 kW heat supply, 43 we show that higher ambition is needed, as we find 20 million units should be installed by 2025 to meet the temperature targets.\n\nTemporarily increasing coal production for some cases is consistent with the IEA's plans and our study. We find increased coal usage in the 2 C scenario compensates for gas. Likewise, while the IEA does not include increased coal as one of its ten key proposals, it is mentioned as a near-term option. 20 CONCLUSIONS Natural gas has long been seen as a low-emission fossil fuel with desirable technical properties that allow it to bridge the gap in the European transition from a conventional to a decarbonized energy system. However, Europe's dependency on imported gas also leaves its countries vulnerable, which Europe's current conflict with Russia has made very clear. Furthermore, upstream emissions of natural gas are currently the subject of debate, questioning whether gas can truly be labeled as low emission.\n\nHere, we have analyzed how a limited supply of natural gas to Europe affects decarbonization scenarios compatible with 1.5 C and 2 C temperature increases. In the main results of the paper, the reduction in gas availability corresponds to the current Russian imports, i.e., roughly 34% of the total gas consumption. However, a sensitivity analysis reveals that similar, although less pronounced results, can be obtained with smaller reductions. In the analysis, we have used the state-of-the-art energy system model PyPSA-Eur-Sec, which include all European countries and all major gasconsuming energy sectors as well as gas used for industrial feedstock.\n\nFor the 1.5 C scenario, the strict limits on the carbon budget push most of the gas out of the system before 2030, both with and without reduced gas availability. As such, we do not find that gas can be viewed as a transitional fossil fuel for any of the 1.5 C scenarios, and as a consequence, limited gas availability has relatively minor long-term implications. In the short-to medium-term, the gas price is increased significantly when gas availability is capped. But after 2030, the price is normalized as the demand is reduced to less than 500 TWh/a. The most significant system response to the increased gas price before 2030 is an accelerated electrification of the heating sector.\n\nFor the 2 C scenario, we observe significant differences between the limited and the unlimited gas cases. With sufficient availability, it is cost optimal to use gas as a transitional fuel, and the use of gas is actually increased slightly for part of the transition to replace, e.g., coal and lignite. Thus, when gas availability is capped, its role as a transitional fuel is challenged and more costly alternatives must be implemented. The consequence is that gas prices only normalize after 2045 when gas demand finally drops below the limit. The main response to gas scarcity in the 2 C scenario are the following: the phase-out of coal and lignite is delayed by a decade; wind and solar PV capacities are built out significantly faster before 2030; and large-scale electrification of the heating sector occurs in a short period of time before 2030. The latter is in contrast to a gradual transition toward 2050 observed for the unlimited case. These changes are all driven by the significantly increased gas prices, whereas CO 2 prices are very similar both with and without reduced gas availability.\n\nComparing the two climate scenarios, we observe that in the medium term, i.e., before 2030, increased gas prices caused by gas scarcity drive a rapid transformation of the energy system. This transformation is compatible with a rapid decarbonization that does not result in stranded assets. However, after 2030, the 1.5 C completely decouples from the impact of the present-day gas crisis as gas demand falls far below the available supply. In the 2 C scenario, on the other hand, present-day decisions to reduce gas imports leave a more permanent mark on the energy system as gas dependency and consequently prices only normalize about two decades later. Thus, a transition corresponding to the 1.5 C scenario not only decreases the chances of suffering the worst impacts of climate change by reducing direct CO 2 emissions, but it also reduces the potential impact of upstream emissions from gas, and it may allow Europeans to experience the freedom of energy independence sooner rather than later.\n\n\nEXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES\n\nResource availability Lead contact Further information and requests for resources and materials should be directed to and will be fulfilled by the lead contact, Tim Pedersen (ttp@mpe.au.dk).\n\n\nMaterials availability\n\nThis study did not generate new unique reagents.\n\nData and code availability All scripts used for data processing and visualization are available under a GPLv3 license at GitHub: https://github.com/TimToernes/Reduced-gas-imports.\n\nEnergy system network files obtained with the open energy model PyPSA-Eur-Sec-0. 6.0 are publicly available and have been deposited at Zenodo: https://doi.org/10. 5281/zenodo.6376540.\n\n\nEnergy system model\n\nThe PyPSA-Eur-Sec energy system model used in this paper is documented in Victoria et al.. 23 A summary of the model will be provided here, while changes from a version update are listed in supplemental information. PyPSA-Eur-Sec is a least-cost linear optimization model representing the energy supply of 33 countries within the ENTSO-E. It performs myopic optimization in 5-year time-steps over the period from 2020 to 2050, by solving a single year to optimality for every 5-year period. For each 1-year simulation, the model assumes long-term market equilibrium, perfect competition, and perfect foresight. It includes a representation of the electricity, heating, land transport, shipping, aviation, industrial sector, including industrial feedstocks, and energy demand in agriculture. Based on a global CO 2 budget corresponding to a specific temperature scenario, annual allowed CO 2 emissions are imposed as a global constraint. Assuming a 67% confidence interval and distribution emission proportional to population, the European carbon budgets correspond to 25.7 and 73.9 Gt CO 2 for 1.5 C and 2 C, respectively. The electricity transmission network is represented with one node per asynchronous area (37 in total) aggregating transmission capacities included in the Ten-Year Network Development Plan. 44 Renewable resources are represented using 370 distinct regions. A single weather year has been used to generate the renewable capacity factors. Here, 2013 was chosen because it represents a year with relative low availability of wind and solar. 7 Heating and industry demands are specified at country level. The electrification of land transport, conversion of shipping into H 2 , and the transformation of the industry sector are exogenous to the model. Conservative European potentials of 1,185 TWh/a of solid biomass and 345 TWh/a of gas are assumed based on the ENSPRESO biomass database. 45 In every optimization run, the model optimizes capacity investment, 3-hourly resolved dispatch, and electricity power flows over a year. The capacities installed in previous years are part of the system until they reach the end of their lifetime, regardless of their utilization.\n\nThe model includes a representation of all the sectors consuming gas in Europe. This comprises gas for electricity production (using CCGT, OCGT, and CHP units), gas for heating in CHP plants, and individual gas boilers, as well as gas consumed in the industry for energy provision or as feedstock (including the production of H 2 via steam methane reforming [SMR] with or without carbon capture [CC]). Gas can have a fossil origin, be it synthetically produced via the Sabatier reaction or upgraded from biogas. For a mathematical formulation of the gas constraint, see supplemental information.\n\nAs the model assumes a copper plate transport model for natural gas, potential internal bottlenecks in the European pipeline are not captured. Local congestion in the pipeline could diversify the implications of limited access to gas reserves even more. \n\n\nSUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION\n\nFigure 2 .\n2Primary energy consumption in model scenarios For a Figure360 author presentation of this figure, see https://doi.org/10.1016/j.joule.2022.06.023.
