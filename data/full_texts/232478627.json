However, ferromagnetic order may also arise in low-density two-dimensional electron systems[1], with signatures observed in silicon [2], III-V semiconductor systems [3], and graphene moir\u00e9 heterotructures [4,5].Here we show that gate-tuned van Hove singularities in rhombohedral trilayer graphene drive the spontaneous ferromagnetic polarization of the electron system into one or more spin-and valley flavors. Using capacitance measurements on graphite-gated van der Waals heterostructures, we find a cascade of density-and electronic displacement field tuned phase transitions marked by negative electronic compressibility. The transitions define the boundaries between phases in which quantum oscillations have either four-fold, two-fold, or one-fold degeneracy, associated with a spin and valley degenerate normal metal, spin-polarized 'half-metal', and spin and valley polarized 'quarter metal', respectively. For electron doping, the salient features of the data are well captured by a phenomenological Stoner model[6] that includes a valleyanisotropic Hund's coupling, likely arising from electronelectron interactions at the scale of the graphene lattice. For hole filling, the single particle band structure features a finite-density van Hove singularity, and we observe a richer phase diagram featuring a delicate interplay of broken symmetries and transitions in the Fermi surface topology. Finally, we introduce a moir\u00e9 superlattice by rotational alignment of a hexagonal boron nitride substrate[5,7]. Remarkably, we find that the superlattice perturbs the preexisting isospin order only weakly, leaving the basic phase diagram intact while catalyzing the formation of topologically nontrivial gapped states whenever itinerant half-or quarter metal states occur at halfor quarter superlattice band filling. Our results show that rhombohedral graphene is an ideal platform for well controlled tests of many-body theory, and reveal magnetism in moir\u00e9 materials [4,5,8,9]to be fundamentally itinerant in nature.In metals, electronic interaction effects become dominant when the potential energy arising from the Coulomb repulsion becomes larger than the kinetic energy the electrons inherit from the band dispersion. This condition is captured by the Stoner criterion[6], U D F > 1, which links the strength of the Coulomb repulsion, U , and the single particle density of electronic states at the Fermi energy, D F . The Stoner criterion provides the qualitative basis for ferromagnetism in transition metals, where a partially filled narrow band arising from the highly localized d-orbitals contributes a large density of states at the Fermi level. However, quantitative modeling of ferromagnetism in metals relies heavily on approximate treatments of exchange and correlation effects, which are typically difficult to directly benchmark to experiment. Model systems such as the two dimensional electron gas offer a path forward, providing a well controlled venue to benchmark many body theory using both more elaborate numerical methods [1], and, ideally, precision experiments. In this regard, graphene-based van der Waals heterostructures present a new opportunity due to their exceptionally low disorder, well known single particle band structures, and a high degree of in-situ control using electric and magnetic fields.In this letter, we focus on rhombohedrally stacked graphene trilayers, characterized by \"ABC\" stacking order where A, B, and C refer to inequivalent relative placements of individual graphene layers within the multilayer crystal(Fig. 1a). All rhombohedral graphite multilayers feature van Hove singularities at or near the band edge[10]where the density of states diverges, which are enhanced by a perpendicular electric displacement field(Fig. 1b-c). Low density ferromagnetism was predicted theoretically for bilayers shortly after the experimental isolation of graphene[11], but signatures of correlation physics at finite density have been observed only recently in rhombohedral trilayers[12], tetralayers[13] and multilayers[14]. Moreover, experiments on rhombohedral trilayer graphene aligned to hexagonal boron nitride[5,7,15]have shown the emergence of a flat electronic band hosting correlation driven insulators appearing at integer filling of the moir\u00e9 superlattice unit cell.

We use dual graphite gated devices [17], which minimize the charge disorder, enabling us to probe the intrinsic properties of these structures as a function of both carrier density n e and the applied perpendicular electric displacement field D (see Fig. S1 and Methods). Fig. 1d-e shows the inverse compressibility measured at zero magnetic field and the base temperature of our dilution refrigerator (temperature dependent data are presented in Fig. S4). At all values of D, the inverse compressibility has a maximum at charge neutrality, consistent with the Dirac nodes (for D = 0) or displacement field induced band gap (for |D| > 0) expected from the single particle band structure. At D = 0, density dependent \u03ba is marked by only two significant features at finite density in the form of a sharp step at n e \u2248 \u22121.2 \u00d7 10 12 cm \u22122 and a kink at n e \u2248 0.5 \u00d7 10 12 cm \u22122 . These features are qualitatively captured by the tight binding band structure of Fig. 1b-c, and correspond to van Hove singularities arising from Lifshitz transitions in the Fermi sea topology, which is simply connected at high densities but is described by an annulus or multiple pockets at lower densities. While some evidence of correlation driven physics is evident for D = 0 at the charge neutrality point (Fig. S2) and near n e \u2248 0.4 \u00d7 10 12 cm \u22122 (Fig. S3), deviations from the single-particle picture are most evident at high |D| where experimental data show many features not present in the tight binding model, in which large displacement field simplifies the electronic structure (see S.I.). The experimental \u03ba features multiple regions of near constant compressibility separated by boundaries where \u03ba is strongly negative. Negative compressibility is generally associated with electronic correlations [16], and may arise at first order phase transitions characterized by phase separation. For electron doping, the high |D| phase diagram appears to consist of three distinct phases at low, intermediate, and high density separated by first order phase transitions, while for hole doping (n e < 0) the phase diagram is more complex. In both cases, however, negative compressibility features develop at finite |D| and evolve towards higher |n e | with increasing |D|. These features rapidly wash out as the temperature is raised, though associated features remain visible at 5K (Fig. S4).\n\nThe nature of competing phases is immediately revealed by finite magnetic field measurements, shown for electron doping in Fig. 2a for a magnetic field B \u22a5 = 1T applied perpendicular to the sample plane. At this field, energy gaps between Landau levels are easily visible as peaks in the inverse compressibility, while the phase boundaries are only slightly altered relative to the zero magnetic field case. As is evident in Fig. 2a the phase transitions observed at B = 0 separate regions of contrasting Landau level degeneracy. In the high density phase, the Landau levels have the combined four-fold degeneracy of the spin and valley flavors native to graphene systems; similarly, at low n e and low D, a 12-fold symmetry emerges due to additional degeneracy of local minima in the strongly trigonally warped Fermi surface [18,19]. However, in the intermediate and low-density phases, respectively, the degeneracy is reduced to two-fold and one-fold. This trend is evident in low-magnetic field magnetoresistance oscillations in the three regimes, Fourier transforms of which are shown in Fig. 2b (see also Figs. S5 and Fig. S6). The loss of degeneracy is consistent with a zero magnetic field phase diagram which contains two distinct phases that spontaneously break the combined spin-and valley isospin symmetry. In this pic- ture, the intermediate density phase consists of two degenerate Fermi surfaces at B \u22a5 = 0, constituting a 'half-metal' as compared to the normally four-fold degenerate graphene, while the low-density phase has a single Fermi surface and is thus a 'quarter-metal.'\n\n\nStoner ferromagnetism\n\nTo better understand the mechanisms leading to the rich magnetic phase diagram observed, we study a fourcomponent Stoner model [20]. Within this model, the grand potential per unit area is given by\n\u03a6 A = \u03b1 E 0 (\u00b5 \u03b1 ) + U A u.c. 2 \u03b1 =\u03b2 n \u03b1 n \u03b2 + \u00b5 \u03b1 n \u03b1 .\nHere A, A u.c. are the area of the sample and unit cell respectively, \u03b1 and \u03b2 index the four spin-and valley flavors, and n \u03b1 and \u00b5 \u03b1 are the density and chemical potential for a given flavor \u03b1. The first term, with E 0 (\u00b5 \u03b1 ) = \u00b5 0 \u03c1( )d , where \u03c1( ) is a density of states per area, accounts for the kinetic energy, and is minimized by occupying all flavors equally. The second term accounts for the effect of exchange interactions, whose strength is parameterized by a constant energy U and which we assume to be symmetric within the spin-and valley isospin space. The exchange energy is minimized when fewer flavors are occupied.\n\nThe inverse compressibility calculated within this model (Figure 2c, inset) captures several key features of the experimental data. First, the model produces a cascade of symmetry broken phases in which the degeneracy of the Fermi surface is reduced (see Fig. 2d, inset, and S. I.). Moreover, the phase transitions separating these phases follow trajectories in the n e \u2212 D plane very similar to those observed experimentally. This dependence can be directly related to the evolution of the band-edge van Hove singularities, which cause the Stoner criterion for ferromagnetism to be satisfied at ever higher |n| with increasing |D| as more states accumulate near the band edge. However, the model deviates significantly from the experimental data, predicting a three-fold degenerate phase that is not observed. The spurious phase is also present in microscopic Hartree Fock calculations (S.I.), and can be traced to the artificial SU(4) symmetry of interactions within these models. More accurately, the internal symmetry group of rhombohedral trilayer graphene consists of SU (2) spin conservation, charge conservation, time reversal, and the lattice symmetries. Within this lower symmetry group, a variety of interactions that are anisotropic within the spin-and valleyspace are allowed, particularly Hund's-type couplings which favor phases with particular broken spin and/or valley symmetries (see S. I.). This problem has been considered in the context of spontaneous symmetry breaking in graphene quantum Hall ferromagnets [21,22], taking the form of an intervalley spin exchange coupling that favors the formation of a canted antiferromagnetic state at charge neutrality. Motivated by this observation, we introduce a flavor anisotropy of the form \u03a6 /A = JA u.c. (n K\u2191 \u2212 n K\u2193 ) (n K \u2191 \u2212 n K \u2193 ). For J > 0, this term favors opposite spin polarizations in the two valleys, as is thought to occur in graphene quantum Hall ferromagnets, while for J < 0 this term corresponds to a Hund's coupling and favors valley unpolarized, spin ferromagnetic ground states. The phase diagram including this term-which is independent of the sign of J, is shown in Fig. 2c-d for U = 30 eV, with |J|/U = 0.3.\n\nTo constrain the precise broken symmetries in the half-and quarter-metal phases, we study the evolution of the phase transitions in an in-plane magnetic field, which couples primarily to the electron spin through the Zeeman effect. The resulting change in density at which a given transition occurs is directly proportional to the difference in Zeeman energy between the two competing phases, making tilted fields a sensitive probe of relative spin polarization. As shown in Fig. 2e, Zeeman energy favors the half-metal over the fully symmetric-and necessarily spin unpolarized-state. Moreover, the phase transition density shows a cusp at B = 0, implying an energy difference that is linear in B as expected for a ferromagnetic half metal with a divergent spin susceptibility at B = 0. In contrast, the transition between half-and quarter metal is unaffected by B as expected for identical-and presumably full-spin polarization in both phases. Measurements of the Hall effect (Figs. 2f and S9) show anomalous Hall effect in the quarter-metal phase but no corresponding effect in the halfmetal. This is expected due to the contrasting Berry curvatures in the two valleys, which cancel for valley unpolarized states but may give rise to an intrinsic anomalous Hall effect for valley polarized states [23]. Taken together, we conclude that the quarter metal is spin-and valley polarized while the half-metal is spin polarized but valley unpolarized (Fig. 2g). Interestingly, this implies a ferromagnetic Hund's coupling (J < 0), in contrast to the the quantum Hall ferromagnet in mono-and bilayer-graphene [24].\n\n\nFerromagnetism and Fermi surface topology in the valence band\n\nAs compared to electron doping, hole-doped rhombohedral trilayer shows a considerably more complex phase diagram, as is seen in the B \u22a5 = 1 T magnetocapacitance data shown in Fig. 3a. The contrast between the phase diagrams of the valence and conduction bands can be related to the single particle band structure, which differs markedly between the two. Most importantly, in the valence band the density of states diverges at a finite density n * e \u2248 \u22125 \u00d7 10 11 cm \u22122 , which corresponds to the merger of three disjoint Fermi pockets at low hole density into a single annular Fermi surface. At still higher |n e |, the small electron pocket centered at each corner of the Brillouin zone disappears, leading to a step discontinuity (see Fig. 3b). As a result, density-driven phase transitions in the valence band may be of several general types. First, as in the conduction band isospin symmetries may break, reducing the degeneracy of the Fermi surface. In addition, Lifshitz transitions in the topology of the Fermi surface, which are already evident in the single particle band structure, may occur. Finally, the nonmonotonic dependence of density of states on n e may favor states with partial isospin polarization, analogous to conventional ferromagnets, and allowing for Lifshitz transitions of a second type in which new Fermi surfaces are nucleated in previously unoccuppied spin/valley flavors.\n\nTo disentangle these phases experimentally, we measure the resistivity as a function of perpendicular magnetic field and n e and plot the Fourier transform of R xx (1/B) (Figs. 3c-d, see also Fig. S7) with frequencies normalized to that corresponding to the total carrier density. Peak position thus indicates fractional share of the total electrons enclosed by a given Fermi contour. At the highest values of |n e |, a single peak (and its harmonics) is visible at f \u03bd = .25, consistent with four fermi surfaces each enclosing an equal share of the total density. As n e crosses the threshold of n e \u2248 1.7 \u00d7 10 12 cm \u22122 in Fig. 3c (corresponding to step in compressibility highlighted in Figs. 1d-e) the frequency of the quarter-density peak begins to grow and a second peak emerges at low frequency. We interpret this as indicating a Lifshitz transition where a small electron Fermi surface is nucleated in the middle of the (now annular) Fermi sea, precisely as predicted by the single particle band structure.\n\nUpon further lowering of |n e | towards zero, a sudden transition in the quantum oscillations is observed near n e \u2248 \u22121.15 \u00d7 10 \u221212 in Fig. 3c. This threshold corresponds to a subtle but visible low \u03ba feature in Fig. 1d. On the low |n e | side of the transition, the oscillation frequencies are less well defined, but but show spectral weight concentrated most prominently at f \u03bd slightly less than 0.5 and at very low frequencies. These features are consistent with a Stoner-type transition to a partially isospin polarized (PIP) phase, with majority and minority charge carriers in two distinct pairs of isospin flavors. These contours continuously evolve until the f \u03bd of the high frequency peak converges to 0.5, whereupon the low frequency peak disappears, consistent with a Lifshitz transition from the PIP phase into a half-metal. Remarkably, this pattern repeats itself as the density is lowered further, as shown in Fig.  3d: the simple half-metal transitions into an half-metal with an annular fermi sea, then to a PIP phase with one majority and one minority flavor, then into a simple quarter metal and then into an annular quarter metal before isospin symmetry is restored at the lowest densities. At these very low densi- ties, each isospin flavor hosts three Fermi pockets, leading to observed oscillation frequencies near f \u03bd = 1/12.\n-0.8 -0.6 -0.4 -0.2 -1.8 -1.6 -1.4 -1.2 -1 -0.\nAs for the electron side, many of these transitions show characteristic B -dependence ( Fig. S8) and anomalous Hall effect ( Fig. S9) that allow us to confirm the spin-and valleypolarizations of the half-and quarter-metal states, which we find to be similar to those on the electron side. We note, however, that transitions involving the PIP phases do not generally show simple linear-in-B behavior; combined with the complexity of the finite B \u22a5 magnetoresistance suggests that these domains may harbor multiple PIP phases.\n\n\nEffect of a moir\u00e9 superlattice potential\n\nExperimental indications of strong interactions in intrinsic rhombohedral graphene have previously been restricted to the very low density (|n e | < 10 11 cm \u22122 ) regime [12,14]. Recently, however, manifestations of strong interaction have emerged in rhombohedral trilayers aligned to hexagonal boron nitride at densities comparable to the phase transitions reported here [5,7,15]. In these devices, insulating states have been observed at filling \u03bd = \u22121 and \u22122 of the superlattice unit cell, including an incipient Chern insulator at \u03bd = \u22121. These experimental findings were interpreted as resulting from polarizing an emergent flat band into one or more valley and spin flavors. It is interesting to reexamine this picture in light of our finding that rhombohedral graphite spontaneously breaks spin and valley symmetry in the absence of a moir\u00e9 potential, which amounts to quantifying the difference between moir\u00e9 superlattice and non-moir\u00e9 superlattice trilayer devices.\n\nWe address this question directly by measuring the inverse compressibility data in a rhombohedral trilayer device aligned to one of the encapsulating hexagonal boron nitride layers ( Fig. 4a) but that has otherwise identical geometry to the unaligned device presented in Figs. 1-3. We find the negative compressibility features associated with Stoner transitions nearly unchanged in the aligned, moir\u00e9 device. The primary difference is the appearance of incompressible states at commensurate fillings \u03bd = \u00b11, \u00b12 of the moir\u00e9 unit cell. The relationship between these insulators and the underlying symmetry breaking in non-moir\u00e9 devices is depicted schematically in Fig. 4b, where we overlay the phase boundaries measured in intrinsic trilayers with the domain of stability of the commensurate, incompressible states in moir\u00e9 patterned trilayers. Evidently, incompressible states emerge whenever the superlattice filling is divisible by the degeneracy of the Fermi surface at the same n e and D absent a moir\u00e9. The effect of the moir\u00e9 can thus be understood as a perturbation that does not qualitatively alter the correlated electron physics already present in the parent trilayer.\n\nIn crystalline systems incompressible gapped states can only occur at commensurate fillings of the lattice. The moir\u00e9 superlattice is qualitatively important in that it allows for gapped states at carrier densities that can be reached by electrostatics gates, and we observe several classes of commensurate gapped states driven by electron interaction in our high quality samples. Gapped states are classified by two quantum numbers, s and t, which respectively encode the number of electrons per lattice site and the Chern number, which is linked to the quantized Hall conductivity. We classify gaps by the resulting trajectories in the n e -B \u22a5 plane, \u03bd = tn \u03c6 + s, where n \u03c6 is the number of magnetic flux quanta per unit cell. Consistent with prior work, we find that commensurate insulators at \u03bd = \u22121 and \u03bd = \u22122 states are topologically trivial for D > 0, with (s, t) = (\u22121, 0) and (\u22122, 0), respectively (see Fig. S10). In contrast, the \u03bd = \u22121 insulators is nontrivial for D < 0 (Fig. 4c). Our high resolution data allow us to observe a close competition between robust t = \u22122 and t = \u22123 Chern insulators for s = \u22121. At high magnetic field, these states occur at different densities, and high inverse compressibility peaks are observed corresponding to both trajectories. As B \u22a5 tends to zero and the states converge to the same density, the t = \u22122 state wins the energetic competition, consistent with transport data (see Fig. S10 and Ref. 5).\n\nAs shown in Figure 4d, we also observe a number of features at fractional filling of the moir\u00e9 superlattice bands. These states are all found to have t = 0 in the low B \u22a5 limit, and occur at \u03bd = s = 1/3, 1/2, 2/3.... The regime where these states are observed corresponds within single particle band structure models to a regime where an unusually flat topologically trivial flat band is partially filled [25]. We interpret them as generalized Wigner crystals, in which electron repulsion leads to commensurate filling of the moir\u00e9 potential, breaking the superlattice symmetry. Similar states have been reported in transition metal dichalcogenide heterobilayers [26,27].\n\n\nDISCUSSION\n\nIt is interesting to compare the itinerant ferromagnetism revealed in rhombohedral trilayer graphene with other physical realizations of ferromagnetism. Unlike in transition metals, ferromagnetism in trilayer graphene does not originate from tightly localized atomic orbitals, but rather is intrinsic to the itinerant electrons themselves. Rhombohedral trilayer graphene may also be contrasted with low density semiconductors[2, 3]. While superficially similar, signatures of ferromagnetism in these systems are observed in an insulating regime, where electron wave functions are localized either by disorder or Wigner crystallization.\n\nDespite the lack of an applied magnetic field, the underlying physics of rhombohedral trilayer graphene closely resembles that of a quantum Hall ferromagnets. Indeed, the sharp peak in the density of states associated with the van Hove singularity plays a similar role to a that of a Landau level: high density of states allows a large gain of exchange energy by isospin polarization, at a small cost in kinetic energy. As in a Landau level, the electronic wave functions corresponding to the high density of states region are strongly overlapping, enhancing the exchange coupling.\n\nThese considerations apply equally well to isospin magnetism in moir\u00e9 heterostructures, which is thought to underpin the correlated physics observed in these systems [28]. From this point of view, it is the high density of states of the flat bands, and not their isolation from high energy dispersive bands, that plays the central role in the ferromagnetic order. As demonstrated here, the primary role of the moir\u00e9 potential is to enable gapped states at finite density. In this light, our results suggest a new design space for van der Waals heterostructures, based on gate tunable isospin magnetism as a building block that is both strongly correlated but also well understood.\n\n\nMETHODS\n\nThe trilayer graphene and hBN flakes were prepared by mechanical exfoliation of bulk crystals. The rhombohedral domains of trilayer graphene flakes were detected by a Horiba T64000 Raman spectrometer with a 488nm mixed gas Ar/Kr ion laser beam. The rhombohedral domains were subsequently isolated using a Dimension Icon 3100 atomic force microscope. The Van der Waals heterostructures were fabricated following a dry transfer procedure. A special stacking order was followed to minimize the mechanical stretching of rhombohedral trilayer graphene. The details are described in Fig. S1.\n\nAll electronic measurements were performed in dilution refrigerators equipped with a superconducting magnet. And capacitance data for the unaligned sample A are largely symmetric under D \u2192 \u2212D; however, for n e \u00d7 D > 0, a high resistance single-gated region is introduced to the contact area where only one of the gates acts on the channel. We thus focus on the n e \u00d7 D < 0 quadrants in the bulk of our analysis, with data over the dull n e , D range shown in Fig. S11.\n\nPenetration field capacitance was measured using a capacitance bridge circuit with an an FHX15X high electron mobility transistor serving as an in situ impedance transformer [17]. An excitation frequency of 10245.12Hz was used to obtain the data in Fig. 4d. The rest of the capacitance data were measured at 54245.12Hz. The quantity directly measured is M = (c p + c parasitic )/c ref , where c p is the capacitance between the top and bottom gate, c ref is the capacitance of the reference capacitor, c parasitic is the parasitic capacitance of the instrument. The inverse compressibility is related to c p by [17], where c t(b) is the geometric capacitance between the top (bottom) gate and the trilayer graphene. To obtain \u03ba, M is measured at two extremes, denoted M \u221e and M 0 . M \u221e corresponds to when the trilayer graphene is a good metal, and is achieved by applying a large out-of-plane magnetic field and tuning the Fermi level within a partially filled Landau level. M 0 corresponds to when the trilayer is incompressible, which can be achieved by applying a large displacement field D while keeping the carrier density n e = 0. In the former case\nc p = ctc b ct+c b +\u03ba \u22121 \u2248 \u03bac t c bc p = 0, therefore M \u221e = c parasitic /c ref . In the later case, c p = (M 0 \u2212 M \u221e )c ref = ctc b ct+c b . From the equations above, \u03ba = 1 2c M \u2212M\u221e M0\u2212M \u221e ,\nwhere the averaged geometric capacitance c = (c t + c b )/2 can be obtained by linear fitting of the carrier density n e , which is known for fixed Landau level filling providing a calibration standard.\n\nTransport measurement was performed using a lock-in amplifier. The frequency was chosen between 17.777Hz to 42.5Hz to minimize the noise. A series of cryogenic highpass filters were applied to reduce the electron temperature.\n\nTo analyze the magnetoresistance oscillations, a fifth-order polynomial fit is subtracted from the R xx (B \u22a5 ) data. The data is then interpolated to produce an even grid as a function of 1/B \u22a5 . Fourier transforms are computed over a range of B \u22a5 \u2208 (.02T, .33T ) for the Raman spectra and extracting the peak maximum corresponding to the 2D mode [29]. b, ABC-stacked domains are isolated using atomic force microscope based anodic oxidation lithography [30]. c, The lower part of the heterostructure is assembled on a polypropylene carbonate (PPC) film which is then d, flipped as it is deposited onto the target substrate [31].

The starting point for the theoretical models used in this work is a six-band continuum model for rhombohedral graphene adapted from Ref. 10:\nH 0 = \uf8eb \uf8ec \uf8ec \uf8ec \uf8ec \uf8ec \uf8ec \uf8ed \u2206 1 + \u2206 2 + \u03b4 1 2 \u03b3 2 v 0 \u03c0 \u2020 v 4 \u03c0 \u2020 v 3 \u03c0 0 1 2 \u03b3 2 \u2206 2 \u2212 \u2206 1 + \u03b4 0 v 3 \u03c0 \u2020 v 4 \u03c0 v 0 \u03c0 v 0 \u03c0 0 \u2206 1 + \u2206 2 \u03b3 1 v 4 \u03c0 \u2020 0 v 4 \u03c0 v 3 \u03c0 \u03b3 1 \u22122\u2206 2 v 0 \u03c0 \u2020 v 4 \u03c0 \u2020 v 3 \u03c0 \u2020 v 4 \u03c0 \u2020 v 4 \u03c0 v 0 \u03c0 \u22122\u2206 2 \u03b3 1 0 v 0 \u03c0 \u2020 0 v 4 \u03c0 \u03b3 1 \u2206 2 \u2212 \u2206 1 \uf8f6 \uf8f7 \uf8f7 \uf8f7 \uf8f7 \uf8f7 \uf8f7 \uf8f8 ,(S1)\nwhere \u03c0 = \u03bek x + ik y (\u03be = \u00b1 corresponds to valleys K and K ) and the Hamiltonian is written in the basis (A 1 , B 3 , B 1 , A 2 , B 2 , A 3 ), where A i and B i denote different sublattice sites on layer i. This Hamiltonian depends on band structure parameters v i = \u221a 3a 0 \u03b3 i /2 with i = 0, 3, 4 and bare hopping matrix elements \u03b3 1 and \u03b3 2 , where a 0 = 2.46\u00c5is the lattice constant of monolayer graphene. In addition, the parameter \u03b4 encodes an on-site potential which is only present at sites A 1 and B 3 since these two atoms do not have a neighbor on the middle layer. Finally, electrostatic potentials on different layers enter Eq. (S1) via \u2206 1,2 . \u2206 1 corresponds to a potential difference between outer layers and is approximately proportional to the applied displacement field, while \u2206 2 is the potential difference between the middle layer compared to mean potential of the outer layers.\n\nThe values of tight-binding parameters \u03b3 0,...,4 and \u03b4 have been constrained in the literature from fits to experimental data [14,32] and ab initio simulations [10,[33][34][35]. However, due to the large number of parameters and limited data availability, there exist significant discrepancies between these estimates. Since interactions play a crucial role in our experiment, fitting parameters using penetration field capacitance measurements, as some of us did previously in for Bernal-stacked trilayer graphene [19], is also not feasible.  To determine the parameters to be adjusted, we compare the hopping matrix elements \u03b3 i between rhombohedral trilayer graphene and Bernal-stacked trilayer graphene. The dominant parameter \u03b3 0 corresponds to the hopping between nearest neighbor atoms, specifically the A and B sublattices in a given layer. Parameters \u03b3 1 , \u03b3 3 , and \u03b3 4 quantify hopping between atoms on adjacent carbon layers. Specifically, for rhombohedral trilayer graphene \u03b3 1 corresponds to the B 1 -A 2 and B 2 -A 3 hopping matrix element, \u03b3 3 corresponds to A 1 -B 2 and A 2 -B 3 , and \u03b3 4 corresponds to A 1 -A 2 or B 2 -B 3 . Since Bernal stacked and rhombohedral trilayer graphene are different only in the relative orientation between layers 1 and 3, we expect \u03b3 0 , \u03b3 1 , \u03b3 3 and \u03b3 4 parameters to have similar value between these two systems. Therefore, we use the values of Bernal-stacked trilayer graphene in the current calculation, which were matched with experimental results on penetration field capacitance in Ref. [19].\n\nIn contrast to the parameters discussed above, \u03b3 2 in rhombohedral trilayer graphene corresponds to hopping between A 1 and B 3 atoms, which are located on the outer layers and are on top of each other. In comparison, for Bernal-stacked trilayer those atoms are A 1 and A 3 , so the value of \u03b3 2 is expected to be different between these two systems. In fact, \u03b3 2 plays an important role in the current study, since it controls the flatness of conduction band, thus changing the onset of symmetry breaking caused by electron-electron interactions. In what follows we fix \u03b3 2 = 15 meV which gives the best match of theoretical result based on Stoner model (see below) and experimentally obtained penetration field capacitance, while being close to values reported in previous studies. The remaining two parameters which need to be fixed are \u03b4 and \u2206 2 . The convention used for \u03b4 for rhombohedral trilayer graphene is opposite compared to the one used in Bernal-stacked graphene. Namely in Bernal-stacked trilayers \u03b4 is an on-site potential for the sites which are on top of each other and is positive [19,36], while for ABC graphene  \u03b4 in Eq. (S1) corresponds to an energy shift for atoms A 1 and B 3 . These atoms lack the neighbor in the middle layer and predominantly host the low energy bands, which could explain the negative value of \u03b4 used in the literature [10]. As can be seen from the effective two band form of Eq. (S1) (see Refs. [10,[33][34][35]), valid for k \u2248 0, both \u03b4 and \u2206 2 act as an energy shift. The value of these two parameters thus mostly modifies the central pocket at low densities, and affects the location of the DOS jump in the valence band. Additionally, \u2206 2 modifies the effective mass of particles close to k = 0, and changes the value of \u2206 1 where a six pocket regime emerges in the valence band. Unfortunately, these are weak effects and cannot be used to fix the value of \u2206 2 independent of other parameters. Using self-consistent Hartree screening calculation we obtain negative values of \u2206 2 of the order of few meV. Based on this considerations, we use experimental data at \u2206 1 = 0 to fix these two parameters and match the location of the \"step\" feature observed at n e = \u22121.2 \u00d7 10 12 cm 2 under the constraint that both \u2206 2 , \u03b4 < 0. The resulting values of all parameters used in the current study are listed in Table I.\n1.0 \u03c1 eV \u22121 A \u22121 u.c.

We calculate the inverse compressibility \u03ba = \u2202\u00b5/\u2202n that corresponds to inverse density of states for non-interacting ABC graphene,with the results shown in Fig. S12(a) as a function of density of electrons, n e and the interlayer potential difference \u2206 1 (which is proportional to the displacement field applied in experiment, D).\n\nThe features observed in Fig. S12a correspond to changes in Fermi surface topology. Figure S12(b) show the density of states as a function of carrier density for zero displacement field, \u2206 1 = 0. While density of states has similar features in the electron and hole bands, these features are quantitatively different due to particle-hole symmetry breaking parameters. In particular, at low \u2206 1 both conduction and valence band have a van Hove singularity (vHs) in the density of states that arises from the merger of several low energy electron pockets, followed (as the absolute density is increased) by the jump in the density of states due to disappearance of a central pocket. However, in the conduction band the central pocket disappears at densities that are close to the density where vHs occurs, rendering nearly invisible (see Fig. S12c-d, which shows Fermi surfaces at several densities). In contrast, in the valence band the DOS jump occurs at much larger hole densities, where it is well resolved. Large displacement fields, for example \u2206 1 = 30 meV as shown in Figs. S12e-g, opens a gap at charge neutrality and flattens the bottom of both valence and conduction bands. This manifests in considerably higher values of the DOS at the peaks in Fig. S12e as compared to Fig. S12b. Moreover, high displacement field introduces additional features at small hole densities in the valence band: a Fermi surface with 6 hole pockets emerges with a corresponding jump in the DOS at low density (see middle panel in Fig. S12f). In contrast, most conduction band features do not change quantitatively even at strong displacement fields.\n\n\nRIGID BAND STONER MODEL\n\n\nSU(4) symmetric model\n\nTo gain insight about electron-electron interaction and symmetry broken phases we first turn to a rigid band Stoner model, resembling that used recently for twisted bilayer graphene [20]. Taking into account spin and valley degrees of freedom we consider a grand potential per area of the system with four density flavors, namely\n\u03a6 MF ({\u00b5 \u03b1 }) A = \u03b1 E(\u00b5 \u03b1 ) + V int \u2212 \u00b5 \u03b1 n (\u00b5 \u03b1 ) ,(S2)\nwhere n (\u00b5 \u03b1 ) = 0 \u03c1 ( ) d is the density for a given flavor, E (\u00b5 \u03b1 ) = \u00b5\u03b1 0 \u03c1 ( ) d is the total kinetic energy of a given flavor, and \u03c1 ( ) is the DOS. The term V int describes interaction between different flavors, which as a first approximation we take to be SU(4) symmetric:\nV int = U A u.c. 2 \u03b1 =\u03b2 n (\u00b5 \u03b1 ) n (\u00b5 \u03b2 ) ,(S3)\nwhere U is the interaction strength and A u.c. = ( \u221a 3/2)a 2 0 is the area of a unit cell. We fix the total chemical potential and determine the realized phase through minimization of the grand potential with respect to flavor densities. Since for the specific band structure the dependence of n(\u00b5) is fixed, the variational parameters are either flavor densities n \u03b1 \u2261 n (\u00b5 \u03b1 ) or, equivalently, individual flavor chemical potentials \u00b5 \u03b1 \u2261 \u00b5 (n \u03b1 ). Noting that \u2202E (\u00b5 \u03b1 ) /\u2202n (\u00b5 \u03b1 ) = \u00b5 (n \u03b1 ) the minimization condition for grand potential, Eq. (S2), reads:\n\u2202E \u2202n \u03b1 + U A u.c. \u03b2 =\u03b1 n \u03b2 \u2212 \u00b5 = \u00b5 (n \u03b1 ) + U A u.c. \u03b2 =\u03b1 n \u03b2 \u2212 \u00b5 = 0.(S4)\nRather than solving the above system of four equations for general case, we restrict the search of solution to a symmetric case and a subset of states with broken symmetries. The trivial symmetric solution (which is the ground state for the U = 0 case) corresponds to the densities of all four flavors being the same. When the Stoner criterion U \u03c1 ( ) > 1 is satisfied, we expect the symmetry broken phases to appear. We consider the subset of possible solutions parameterized by a discrete parameter l, where l flavors have density n e , while remaining 4 \u2212 l flavors have density n with n > n . Parameter l can take values between 1 and 3, thus labeling a number of filled Fermi surfaces. Corresponding equations determining the densities can be deduced from the general Eq. (S4). After solving those equations for all values of l, we select the solution with the lowest value of grand potential. Once we have determined the densities for all flavors for specific total chemical potential, we sum all densities together and get the dependence of the density on total chemical potential. Differentiating this function we finally obtain density of states and inverse compressibility.\n\nFigs. S13a and d show a color plot of compressibility, similar to one in Fig. S12 but for the SU(4) symmetric Stoner model. For both electrons and holes, we observed four distinct regions in which the flavor densities evolve continuously, separated by regions where, in our model, the compressibility is undefined. Physically, these regions correspond to first order phase transitions where the system breaks up into domains of competing phases, and where negative compressibility is therefore expected. For large fillings of valence and conduction band, the system is not polarized and carriers are equally distributed between four flavors. As we move closer to neutrality point the polarization into triple, twofold and single flavor degenerate regions is observed, as can be seen clearly in the plots of individual densities as a function of a total density for fixed \u2206 1 in Figs. S13b and e. The corresponding Fermi surfaces, shown in Fig. S13c and f, reveal the primary difference between conduction and valence band is the Fermi surface topology rather than symmetry breaking. In the valence band, each flavor polarized region contains a replicas of the DOS jump observed in the single particle band structure. In the conduction band, instead, no such features are observed. This is expected: interations strongly disfavor occupation of the bands where the density of states diverges, and so such situations are avoided by ferromagnetism polarization. Because in the conduction band the DOS-step is very close to the van Hove singularity, they are not observed in experiment or in our interacting theory.\n\n\nPhenomenological breaking of SU(4) symmetry\n\nIn reality, interactions in graphene systems do not have perfect SU(4) symmetry; rather, the true symmetries are separate SU(2) symmetry of the electron spin and a U(1) symmetry relating the two valleys. Interactions may thus exist which introduce additional scattering channels between the valleys, explicitly breaking the SU(4) symmetry. We account for such symmetry breaking by modifying the interaction potential in the rigid Stoner model as\nV int = U A u.c. 2 \u03b1 =\u03b2 n \u03b1 n \u03b2 + JA u.c. (n 1 \u2212 n 3 )(n 2 \u2212 n 4 ),(S5)\nwhere we take the following correspondence between values of Greek indices and valley and spin orientations: 1 = {K, \u2191}, 2 = {K , \u2191}, 3 = {K, \u2193}, 4 = {K , \u2193}, and J < 0 so that the lowest energy two-fold states are spin polarized and valley unpolarized as observed in experiment. The second term that is proportional to J physically corresponds to a Hund's rule type anisotropy, that will be justified on a microscopic basis in the next section.\n\nThe effect of the J term is twofold. As is clear from Eq. (S5) the four flavors split into non-equivalent groups of two. Therefore, increasing |J| leads to suppression of three-fold degenerate and one fold degenerate regions in the phase diagram. In addition, |J| > 0 allows for existence of more complicated solutions such as n 1 = 0, n 3 = n 4 > n 2 > 0. Since the Stoner model calculation is performed on realistic band structure of rhombohedral trilayer graphene, the realized phases are highly dependent of band structure parameters.\n\n\nHARTREE-FOCK MODEL\n\nTo test the robustness of the results obtained from the simple Stoner model, we perform a more detailed Hatree-Fock analysis of the cascade of spin and valley symmetry-breaking transitions as a function of density. We begin with the Hamiltonian H 0 in Eq. (S1), and add to it a screened Coulomb interaction\nH c = 1 2 \u03b1,\u03b2,i,j d 2 rd 2 r U (|r \u2212 r |)\u03c8 \u2020 i\u03b1 (r)\u03c8 \u2020 j\u03b2 (r )\u03c8 \u03b2j (r )\u03c8 i\u03b1 (r),(S6)\nwhere \u03b1, \u03b2 = 1, . . . , 4 runs over the spin and valley indices, i, j = 1, . . . , 6 label the two sublattices and three layers (this is the six-dimensional space in which H 0 is written), and \u03c8 \u2020 j\u03b1 (r) creates an electron at position r, sublattice/layer j, and spin/valley \u03b1. The interaction is taken to be U (r) =\nd 2 q (2\u03c0) 2 U (q)e iq\u00b7r , where U (q) = 2\u03c0e 2 tanh qd q ,(S7)\ncorresponding to screening by two symmetric metallic gates at a distance d above and below the system ( is an effective dielectric constant, which includes the HBN and the screening from the remote bands of the trilayer graphene). The screened Coulomb potential is assumed to depend only on the local density of electrons, and does not depend on any of the internal indices (such as spin and valley). This type of interaction is expected to dominate when the average distance between charge carriers is much larger than the inter-atomic spacing, as is always the case in our system. Later, we will include phenomenologically the effects of short-distance interactions that may depend on the spin and valley indices.\n\nWe treat the Hamiltonian H = H 0 + H c within the Hartree-Fock approximation. To this end, we use a variational quadratic Hamiltonian H var to generate a variational state, and minimize the variational free energy over the parameters of H var . In order to simply the calculation, we restrict the variational state in several ways: 1. All the bands away from the Fermi level are \"frozen\", i.e., we do not allow the variational Hamiltonian to mix the active (partially filled) band with the completely filled or completely empty bands; 2. We allow only states that preserve the separate spin and valley conservation symmetries of the Hamiltonian. The first simplification is justified as long as the remote bands are separated from the active band by a sufficiently large gap. Most crucially, it requires the displacement field to be sufficiently large compared to the magnitude of the Coulomb interaction. The second simplification omits the possibility of states that break the valley conservation symmetry spontaneously by occupying states that are coherent superpositions of the two valleys. We leave the study of such states to future theoretical work.\n\nThe blue curves in Fig. S14 show representative results for the variational Hatree-Fock free energy per electron as a function of the electronic density of different types of spin-and valley-polarized states, measured relative to the symmetric state (where all the spin and valley flavors are populated equally). As in the Stoner model, the states labelled by l = 1, 2, 3 are states in which l spin or valley flavors are populated, and the other 4 \u2212 l flavors are empty. The results are qualitatively similar to those of the Stoner model, in that the system undergoes a cascade of first-order transitions upon increasing the density from the charge neutrality point, according to the sequence (1,2,3,4). Qualitatively similar results are also obtained for other values of the displacement field \u2206 1 and for a hole-doped system.\n\nIn order to match the experiment, where the l = 3 state is not observed, we need to consider interaction terms beyond the long-range Coulomb interaction [Eq. (S6)] which is SU(4) symmetric in spin and valley space. Interactions at ranges of the order of a few lattice constants (either Coulombic or phonon-mediated) can depend on the spin and valley indices of the electrons. We model these short-range terms as\nH A =\u0168 2 d 2 r : (n K + n K ) 2 : +\u1e7c 2 d 2 r : (n K \u2212 n K ) 2 : +J d 2 r : \u03c3 K \u00b7 \u03c3 K :,(S8)\nwhere n K (r) and n K (r) are the local densities of electrons in the two valleys. The operators \u03c3 K (r), \u03c3 K (r) are the local spin densities, defined as \u03c3 K (r) = s1,s2 \u03c8 \u2020 Ks1 (r)\u03c3 s1,s2 \u03c8 Ks2 (r) (and similarly for \u03c3 K ), where \u03c3 s,s are Pauli matrices acting in spin space, and \u03c8 \u2020 Ks is the creation operator for electrons at valley K and spin s =\u2191, \u2193 in the active band that crosses the Fermi level (which we project to in our calculation). Normal ordering of an operator\u00d4 is denoted by :\u00d4 :. The\u0168 term is a local spin and valley-isotropic interaction,\u1e7c parameterizes the difference in the local interaction strength between electrons of the same valley and electrons in different valleys, and theJ term is a spin-exchange Hund's rule coupling between electrons of different valleys. Eq.

S14. Free energy f per electron as a function of electron density, measured relative to that of a spin and valley-symmetric state, fsym. The blue curve shows the result of a calculation with only a long-range, spin and valley-symmetric screened Coulomb interaction (Eq. (S6)). The red curve was obtained by including also an interaction of the form (S8) withJ = \u22120.03U (q = 0) (see Eq. (S7)),\u0168 =\u1e7c = 0. The top (bottom) panel shows results for a displacement field of \u22061 = 20meV (\u22061 = 40meV), respectively. The label l indicates the number of populated spin and valley flavors. The effective dielectric constant was taken to be = 8, and the distance to the metallic gates is d = 150a0, where a0 is the unit cell size of graphene. The calculations were performed at a low but finite temperature, T = 0.2 meV.\n1 U h H F i e M i W i / x E I h O h 7 G 8 0 E o o z I 2 e W U K a E v R W x C V W U G Z t O w Y b w 9 S n 6 n 3 Q q Z V I t k 5 u L U h O v 4 s j D C Z z C O R C o Q R O u o Q V t Y D C G B 3 i C Z\nOur parameterization of the short-range interactions is related to that used by Kharitonov [22] in modeling the spin and valley polarization of electrons in the zero Landau levels in graphene,\nH A = d 2 r u z 2 : (\u03c8 \u2020 \u03c4 z \u03c8)(\u03c8 \u2020 \u03c4 z \u03c8) : +u \u22a5 : (\u03c8 \u2020 \u03c4 + \u03c8)(\u03c8 \u2020 \u03c4 \u2212 \u03c8) : +H.c. ,(S9)\nwhere \u03c4 are Pauli matrices that act in valley space and \u03c8 \u2020 = (\u03c8 \u2020 K\u2191 , \u03c8 \u2020 K\u2193 , \u03c8 \u2020 K \u2191 , \u03c8 \u2020 K \u2193 ), by the following relations:\u0168 = \u2212 u \u22a5 4 , V = u z \u2212 u \u22a5 4 ,J = \u2212 u \u22a5 2 . We have explored the Hartree-Fock phase diagram of the system including the short-range interaction term (S8) for a few parameter sets, leaving a complete mapping of the phase diagram for future work. The red curves in Fig. S14 show the free energy as a function of electronic density with an additional ferromagnetic Hund's rule coupling of strengthJ = \u22120.03 U (q = 0) (with U (q) given by Eq. (S7)). The other parameters in Eq. S8,\u0168 and\u1e7c , were set to zero. As can be seen in the figure, this value of the Hund's coupling is sufficient to completely suppress the l = 3 phase, in agreement with the experiment. SinceJ < 0, the region labelled by l = 2 is a valley-unpolarized, spin-polarized phase; this phase is favored by the J term compared to the l = 3 region, causing the disappearance of the latter phase. For |J| < 0.03U (0), the l = 3 region reappears. The l = 2 region has the same spin polarization per electron as the l = 1 region, in agreement with experiment (see Figs. 2 and 3 of the main text).\n\nThe l = 3 region can also be suppressed by increasing\u1e7c while keeping\u0168 = \u2212\u1e7c , which increases the repulsion between electrons in the same valley relative to the repulsion between electrons of opposite valleys. However, even for\u1e7c as strong as 0.25 U (q = 0), the l = 3 region is not completely eliminated. Thus, within our model, we conclude that the inter-valley Hund's rule couplingJ is much more effective than the\u1e7c term in suppressing the l = 3 region.\n\nThe anisotropic interaction terms that are necessary to suppress the 3-fold region in our calculations originate from lattice scale Coulomb repulsion or electron-phonon coupling. The natural scale for such terms can be estimated as a0 0 d 2 re 2 /( r) = 2\u03c0e 2 a 0 / , where a 0 = 0.246 nm is the graphene unit cell size and is an effective dielectric constant, taken for simplicity to be identical to that used in the long-range Coulomb interaction (S7). Since we have used d = 150a 0 \u2248 40 nm in our calculations, the short-range interactions are naively estimated to be of the order of 0.5% \u2212 1% of U (q = 0). The Hund's rule term needed to suppress the l = 3 region is of this order of magnitude (although somewhat larger).\n\nIt is interesting to note that the current experiment strongly suggests that the 2-fold region is fully spin polarized, indicating thatJ < 0. In contrast, in the \u03bd = 0 quantum Hall insulator in both monolayer and bilayer graphene, experiments indicate that the ground state is a valley-unpolarized, nearly spin-unpolarized state (a \"canted anti-ferromagnet\" [37,38]), corresponding t\u00f5 J > 0. The difference between the two may come from the strong renormalization of the short-range anisotropic interactions from remote bands, which may be very different in our system than in monolayer and bilayer graphene in the quantum Hall regime.\n\nFIG. 1 .\n1Spontaneous symmetry breaking in rhombohedral trilayer graphene. a, Crystal structure of rhombohedral trilayer graphene. b, Band structure of rhombohedral trilayer graphene with an interlayer potential \u22061 = 0 (black) and 30 meV (blue) calculated from the six-band continuum model (see S.I.)\n\nFIG. 2 .\n2Stoner ferromagnetism in the conduction band. a, False-color plot of the inverse compressibility \u03ba measured at B \u22a5 = 1 T. b, Fourier transform of Rxx(1/B) at D = \u22120.43 V/nm and the indicated values of ne, expressed in units of \u00d710 12 cm \u22122 .
