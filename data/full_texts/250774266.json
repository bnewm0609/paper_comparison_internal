This condition is also approximately satisfied at higher fields.\n\nIntroduction\n\nIt has been known for many years that the application of stress to a ferromagnet can cause changes in the magnetisation. In fact is has been stated by Bozorth and Williams (1945) that stress aranks with field strength H and temperature Tas one of the primary factors affecting magnetisation. The phenomenon has been the subject of investigations since the work of Ewing (1890) and has recently been receiving increasing attention particularly from those interested in applying it to the determination of residual stress in magnetic specimens.\n\nAccording to McCaig (1977) the effects of stress on magnetisation can be adequately explained by considering the magnetostriction coefficient A and the sign of the applied stress, whether negative (compression) or positive (tension). In this way it would be expected that the magnetisation of a material with positive magnetostriction coefficient would increase with tension and decrease with compression. Measurements taken in the present work have shown that the changes in magnetisation with stress can be of the same sign whether under tension or compression, given the same initial conditions of Mand H . This type of behaviour was predicted theoretically by Brown (1949) and by Brugel and Rimet (1966). Furthermore, experimental results by Craik and Wood (1970) have also confirmed this, although the magnitude of the changes in the two cases are generally rather different. Present results have also indicated that the change in magnetisation under tension, for example, can have different signs depending on the location of the initial conditions M , H on the hysteresis loop. Clearly therefore there are contradictions in the results and interpretations presented by different workers in this field. It is the purpose of this paper to present a theory of the underlying processes which contribute to this effect and to show how the diversity of reported results can be reconciled.\n\n\nTheory of the magnetisation process in ferromagnets\n\nThe interpretation of the magnetising process in ferromagnetic materials has generally required the consideration of two related mechanisms. The first of these is that the domain walls move under the influence of an applied field in such a way that favourably aligned domains grow at the expense of unfavourably aligned domains. The second mechanism involves rotation of aligned moments within a domain towards the field direction. This is usually referred to as domain rotation.\n\nConsider the energy per unit volume of a typical domain with magnetic moment m per unit volume in a magnetic field H. If there is coupling between the magnetisation in different domains then\nE = -,uQm ( H + a M )(1)\nwhere a is a mean field parameter representing the interdomain coupling and is to be determined experimentally. The equation may then be expressed as\nE = -m * B ,(2)\nwhere the effective field B, is B, = po(H + EM).\n\nSuch an effective field has been used by Callen et a1 (1977). It will be seen that the effective field is analogous to the Weiss (1907) field, although the mean field parameter a i s different in the two cases. Applying Maxwell-Boltzmann statistics and integrating over 4nsolid angle leads, in the case of a = 0, to the Langevin (1905) equation, and in the case of a # 0 to amodified Langevin equation for the bulk magnetisation (Jiles and Atherton 1983a) where a = kB T l b m .\n\nAlthough the Langevin equation works well for paramagnets, the modified Langevin equation above does not give such a good description of the behaviour of a ferromagnet because the model ignores the possibility of the change of magnetisation being impeded, such as when the motion of domain walls is inhibited by pinning sites. Instead it applies only to the case of an ideal or perfect crystal in which the domain walls move until they reach thermodynamic equilibrium. This situation can be created artificially in a sample by the application of a decaying AC field superimposed on the DC field as described by Cullity (1972). This yields the ideal magnetisation curve, also known as the anhysteretic curve, which is described by the modified Langevin equation. In this case the pinning sites have been overcome and the final value of magnetisation is that which would have been achieved by the DC field in the absence of pinning.\n\nThe initial magnetisation curve of a ferromagnet always lies below the anhysteretic; however, it approaches the anhysteretic asymptotically at higher fields. In the high field regions therefore the magnetisation is described fairly well by equation (4).\n\n\nDomain wall motion\n\nThe motion of domain walls under the influence of an applied magnetic field is impeded by the presence of pinning sites in the lattice as explained by Becker and Doring (1939) and by Kersten (1938Kersten ( , 1933. Later Nee1 (1947) modified these theories to include the concept of flexible domain walls such that, when stationary, a wall would always be located on pinning sites. Correlation between domain wall motion and net or macroscopic magnetisation has been observed experimentally by Williams and Shockley (1949).\n\nThese concepts have been utilised in the present work in conjunction with the idea of Kersten (1948) that the changes in wall energy are balanced by the changes in mutual energy of the field Hand the magnetisation M . However, there has been no consideration of the different types of pinning site. All types of pinning site have been considered equivalent and a mean pinning energy associated with each site used.\n\nIf a domain wall is displaced in a completely uniform (i.e. constant) potential then no change in wall energy would occur (Chikazumi 1964 p 264) and therefore when the field was removed the wall would remain in its final position. Therefore in order to have reversible wall displacement, as would occur in an ideal (or unpinned) specimen, it is necessary to invoke a potential which increases with the magnetisation. The domain boundary will then come to rest when the work done by the field is balanced by the magnetisation energy of the sample as indicated by Hoselitz (1952), and when the field is removed the domain wall will return to its original position.\n\nConsider the total work done per unit volume by a magnetic field where the second term on the right-hand side is the work done in changing the magnetisation of the material.\n\nIn the case of a paramagnet the magnetisation is reversible and consequently the work done per unit volume by the magnetic field on the sample is In the absence of pinning the domain walls of a ferromagnet are acted upon by what may be envisaged as a pressure which tends to move them in such a way that the magnetisation reaches equilibrium at the corresponding anhysteretic value. Using the effective field B, for the ferromagnet If for some reasom M does not reach this value then the material will have a net potential energy Ernag such that and for an ideal or unpinned ferromagnet all of the potential is converted into magnetisation energy and Ernag = 0.\n\n\nEffects of domain wall pinning on the magnetisation\n\nWhen considering a real ferromagnet the consequences of domain wall pinning must be included in the energy equation. This leads to irreversible changes in the magnetisation with field and hence to hysteresis in the magnetisation, which is generally attributed to impedance of domain wall motion according to Carey and Isaac (1965, p 32).\n\nConsider a pinning site on a domain wall between domains with magnetisation m and m' where m is aligned parallel to the field and is the growing domain while m' is aligned at some arbitrary angle 8 to the field and hence to m . The energy required to overcome the pinning site will depend on two factors, the nature of the pinning site itself and the relative orientations of the magnetisations in the domains on either side of the wall. Suppose the energy required to overcome the pinning site is proportional to the change in energy per unit volume of the m' domain caused by rotating its moments into the field direction and hence parallel to m .\n\n\nA E = m . B -m ' * B\n\nand consequently if spin, the pinning energy of the one pinning site, is proportional to\nA E x mB(1 -COS 8 ) .(10)\nIf the pinning energy of the site for 180\" walls is E, then E ,~ 2mB. Therefore the pinning energy of the typical site may be expressed as Epin = ;E,(I -COS e) (11) and taking (E,) as the average pinning energy of all the sites for 180\" walls, and assuming a uniform density of pinning sites of n per unit volume throughout the solid\n( s p i n ) = if( (1 -COS 8)(12)\nwhere Epin is the total energy lost through pinning when a domain wall of areaA is moved through a distance x , between domains whose magnetisations lie at an angle 8. The net change in magnetisation of the ferromagnet (remembering that by symmetry there will be a number of domains at an angle 8 to the field direction such that the component of magnetisation perpendicular to the field due to these domains will sum to zero) will be\nd M = m ( l -COS 8 ) A * dx(14)\nand substituting for A dx in the equation for energy leaves which is independent of the relative orientations of the domains. That is? although the energy required to move a domain wall through a more unfavourably oriented domain is greater, the change in magnetisation achieved by doing so is also proportionally greater.\n\nReplacing the terms on the right-hand side by the constant k\nEpin = k 1 dM.\nHence under the assumptions of a uniform distribution of pinning sites, and treating each one as having the average pinning energy, the total work done against pinning is proportional to the change in magnetisation. The magnetisation energy J M * dB, is therefore the difference between the energy which would be attained in the ideal or unpinned case J f ( B , / , h a ) dB, minus the loss due to hysteresis. and consequently, differentiating with respect to B, This is the equation of state of a ferromagnet under the given conditions as indicated previously (Jiles and Atherton 1983a). It is felt that the coefficient k probably varies with M . The directional parameter 6 takes the values t 1 and is introduced as the effect of pinning is always to oppose the rate of change of M .\n\nSoluticns of equation (19) for various values of the parameters are shown in figure 1. Figure l  In figure 2(a) experimentally determined anhysteretic curves for two different stress levels are shown compared with theoretical curves obtained from equation (19) by setting k = 0 with the values of the other parameters as given. Figure 2(b) shows the experimental initial magnetisation curves for the same two stress levels which are again compared with theoretical initial magnetisation curves for the values of the parameters given in the figure.\n\n\nVariation of the parameter k with magnetisation and field\n\nIn practice the parameter k of equation (19) varies with M and H since equation (14) is an approximation which is only valid when the change in magnetisation is due to uniformly impeded domain wall motion. In fact where dM, is the change in M due to rotation and dM,, is the change due to wall motion. Taking the loss due to domain rotation equal to y times the loss due to pinning gives where ywill be determined later and since at the origin of coordinates ( H = 0, M = 0) in the demagnetised state any changes in magnetisation will be due exclusively to domain wall motion, the value of k at this point is where ko = 3250 and k l = 2000. With this k dependence the hysteresis curve of figure 3 was obtained. The values of the other parameters, as given in the caption, were chosen to correlate with those obtained under zero stress conditions.\nd M = dM, + dM,.,(20)\n\nEffects of stress on magnetisation\n\nThe influence of stress on magnetisation may be understood in terms of the dependence of the coefficients a and a upon stress and the effect of stress on domain wall pinning   (Jiles and Atherton 1983b). Measurements in the present work have indicated that the anhysteretic curve, and hence a and a, is stress dependent as shown in figure 4. The dependence of the anhysteretic on stress is also partly the cause of the different shapes of the major hysteresis loops under iso-stress conditions as shown in figures 5 , 6 and 7 , where the stress has been held constant at the indicated values while the field was cycled. The iso-stress anhysteretic curves are reversible with respect to both field and stress. If the stress is cycled when the magnetisation is at the anhysteretic value then the magnetisation returns to its original anhysteretic value on completion of the stress cycle. It is clear however that the actual value of the magnetisation changes during the stressing since the anhysteretic curve itself changes with stress.\n\nWhen the initial, zero stress, conditions are on the anhysteretic, or alternatively when the applied field is sufficiently high that the magnetisation must of necessity lie very close to the anhysteretic, then the sign of dMldadependsupon the magnetostriction coefficient. However, when considering the effects of stress on magnetisation at low fields, that is when the initial conditions may lie far from the anhysteretic, then in general the sign of dM/dadoes not depend upon the magnetostriction coefficient. The results of figure 8, taken with the same zero stress conditions at 1.6 kA m-l along the initial magnetisation curve, show that the direction of change of magnetisation is here independent of the sign of the applied stress.\n\nThe crucial factor in these cases is whether the dominant mechanism behind the change in magnetisation is domain wall motion or not. The effect of an applied stress is to cause some of the domain walls to break away from their pinning sites and consequently they will move in such a way as to cause the magnetisation to approach the anhysteretic. In the low field region domain wall motion is the dominant mechanism and under these conditions experimental results, such as those of figure 8, have indicated that the change of magnetisation has the same direction independent of the sign of stress. These results are in accordance with the theory which predicts that when the initial magnetisation condition lies above the anhysteretic the application of a stress cycle of o IMPa) either sign causes a decrease in magnetisation. Converseley when the zero stress magnetisation lies below the anhysteretic, the application of a stress cyclic of either sign causes an increase in magnetisation.\n\n\nThe effects of stresss on pinning of domain walls\n\nIf a solid is subjected to uniaxial stress then this will cause the dislocations in the lattice to move and change the energy associated with point defects. The superimposing of an applied stress on the existing internal residual stresses will cause changes in the total stress. The effect of stress on various inclusions is not entirely clear; however, the applied stress will certainly cause changes in the stress fields associated with any voids in the solid.\n\nTherefore the external stress will cause changes in the energy of the various imperfections and impurities, including inhomogeneous residual stresses, all of which have been considered to be responsible for pinning domain walls by earlier theories of the magnetisation process (Becker and Doring 1939, Kersten 1938.1943, Nee1 1947. The diversity of different types of pinning site makes it difficult to make a precise statement about the effect of stress. However, it is reasonable to assume that the pinning energy of some sites will be decreased while the pinning energy of other sites is increased.\n\nConsider the effect of applying a varying stress U, of either sign, under conditions of constant field strength H . If the pinning sites which the domain walls are located on under the initial conditions are considered then some of these will have their pinning energy increased and hence the wall will simply remain pinned at these sites causing no overall change in the magnetisation. However among the group of pinning sites for which the pinning energy is reduced will be some for which the reduction of energy causes the domain walls to break away and begin moving. It is then necessary to consider how these walls which succeed in breaking away from their pinning sites are likely to move.\n\nReturning to the original equation for the potential energy of a ferromagnet in the absence of pinning sites, it is clear that the domain walls will move towards the anhysteretic curve in the absence of pinning. Therefore, once a domain wall has succeeded in breaking away from the pinning site it will be subject locally to this potential and hence this will cause changes in magnetisation towards the anhysteretic value until it becomes pinned again. If this behaviour is summed over the whole of the solid then, on the basis of the model presented, the application of a stress would cause the bulk magnetisation  It can be seen that in this case the net changes in E are almost negligible compared to the changes from the initial magnetisation curve. The curve is the difference between initial and anhysteretic values of E as a function of H . Results are for sample B.\n\nIt seems that the guiding principle in these cases is that the application of stress, of either sign, causes the magnetisation (or the flux density B , since for ferromagnets in this region B -p 0 M ) to approach the anhysteretic (Jiles and Atherton 1983b) since this represents the global thermodynamic equilibrium state.\n\nIt is necessary to emphasise that the anhysteretic curve itself changes with stress, so for example, if a ferromagnet with A > 0 is subjected to a compressive stress when the initial conditions of ( M , H ) are on the normal magnetisation curve, below the anhysteretic, then the change in M will be positive at first since M will approach the anhysteretic. If the magnitude of stress is sufficiently large, however, the anhysteretic level of magnetisation, which decreases with compression, will eventually reach the level of the sample magnetisation causing M to decrease with further stress since it will, according to the above principle, move towards the anhysteretic.\n\n\nDependence of the changes in magnetisation on the initial conditions\n\nMeasurements were taken of the change in magnetisation caused by a stress cycle from 0 MPa to a tension of a,,, = 140 MPa and back to zero at different points along the initial magnetisation curve. The locus of the anhysteretic curve was also measured and it was found that the change in flux density AB (a,,,, H )  It can also be seen from the earlier graphs of A B against a i n figure 11 that to a first approximation also\nA B ( a , H ) x a(26)\nalthough the general behaviour under compression and tension is slightly different.\n\nstress cycling is negligible when the initial conditions lie on the anhysteretic.\n\nFurthermore from figure 12 it can be seen that the net change in flux density with\n\n\nSample specifications\n\nThe two steel samples used in this work had compositions as given in table 1. The major constituent other than iron was 1% to 2% manganese. The length of the specimens was 6 cm with a 1 cm square cross-section. The samples were aligned with their long axis along the field direction.\n\n\nSummary and conclusions\n\nA theory of the magnetisation process in ferromagnetic materials has been derived by formulating earlier qualitative theories of the underlying mechanism. The magnetisation process is explained in terms of two related phenomena, domain wall motion and rotation of magnetisation. In the ideal case where no pinning of domain walls occurs an energy equation is derived based on a mean field theory.\n\nIn the case of a real solid the domain walls are pinned by defect sites and work therefore has to be done to overcome the pinning. The energy equation can then be rewritten to include the energy used in overcoming pinning and the equation of state derived from this.\n\nAn equation of state for a real ferromagnet is given and it is shown that this exhibits the main features of hysteresis such as remanent magnetisation on removal of the applied field, increasing hysteresis loss with field cycling as the amplitude of the applied field is increased, and coercivity.\n\nIt has been shown that the application of stress, whether compressive or tensile, at a given constant field strength, causes the magnetisation to approach the anhysteretic curve. This implies that on the initial magnetisation curve, at low fields the magnetisation increases when the sample is subjected to stress cycling of either compression or tension. When above the anhysteretic curve, on regions of the upper branch of the hysteresis loop, the magnetisation decreases with stress cycling.\n\nIt follows from this principle that for a material whose magnetisation is particularly sensitive to stress it would be possible to reach the anhysteretic curve from the initial magnetisation curve by application of a sufficiently large stress only. In fact this has been reported for the case of 68 Permalloy by Bozorth and Williams (1945). However. they only remarked that the stress-cycled curve at an amplitude of 40 MPa seemed to be identical to the anhysteretic curve. They were not aware of the more general principle of approach to the anhysteretic with stress.\n\nIn addition some work on the changes in magnetisation with stress at various points along the initial magnetisation curve was undertaken many years ago by Thompson (1884). The shape of the curve which was obtained was of the same form as the present results as shown in figure 12.\n\nThe interpretation of these results has been made possible by the application of the model given. It is considered that the application of stress causes the pinning energy to vary and in some cases this results in the domain walls breaking away from their pinning sites. When this occurs the walls are subject to the magnetic potential of the ideal crystal and hence move towards the anhysteretic equilibrium until they encounter further defect sites and are pinned again.\n\nThe application of Le Chatelier's principle and the magnetostriction coefficient in order to determine the change of magnetisation with stress, as has been suggested by other authors. can strictly only be applied to cases where the initial conditions of M and H are such that it lies on the anhysteretic curve. Alternatively, at high fields when the initial magnetisation curve and the two branches of the hysteresis loop come sufficiently close to the anhysteretic curve this interpretation will also be approximately true. The reason for this is that the anhysteretic curve itself also changes with stress as predicted by the theoretical equation of state. Consequently the anhysteretic value of magnetisation will change as anticipated from the mangetostriction coefficient, i.e. E. > 0 + (dM,,/d a) > 0 A < 0 + (dM,,/da) < 0 and in this case the sign of the change in magnetisation will depend on whether the specimen is subjected to compression or tension.\n\nFigure 1 .\n1(a) Theoretical anhysteretic curves obtained from equation (4) with M , = 1.6 X 106A m-1 and a = 0.0033. a(Am\"): -5000; ---4000; -.-.-3000; -..-..-2000.
