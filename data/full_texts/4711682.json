In this\"New Ideas and Emerging Results\"paper we introduce a CPS research incubator -- based upon a system, and its associated project environment, for managing and coordinating the flight of small Unmanned Aerial Systems (sUAS). The research incubator provides a new community resource, making available diverse, high-quality project artifacts produced across multiple releases of a safety-critical CPS. It enables researchers to experiment with their own novel solutions within a fully-executable runtime environment that supports both high-fidelity sUAS simulations as well as physical sUAS. Early collaborators from the software engineering community have shown broad and enthusiastic support for the project and its role as a research incubator, and have indicated their intention to leverage the environment to address their own research areas of goal modeling, runtime adaptation, safety-assurance, and software evolution.", "fields_of_study": "[\"Computer Science\"]", "external_ids": {"arxiv": "1804.02423", "mag": "2964279195", "acl": null, "pubmed": null, "pubmedcentral": null, "dblp": "conf/icse/Cleland-HuangVB18", "doi": "10.1145/3183399.3183408"}}, "content": {"source": {"pdf_hash": "da0dab0530960f6c2bbaefd217a040934a8826ab", "pdf_src": "ACM", "pdf_uri": null, "oa_url_match": false, "oa_info": {"license": null, "open_access_url": "https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3183399.3183408", "status": "BRONZE"}}, "grobid": {"id": "2d45cfe287f1f993d432a7d5a8d4608da20a34aa", "type": "plain-text", "url": "s3://ai2-s2-pdf-extraction-prod/parse-results/s2orc_worker/da0dab0530960f6c2bbaefd217a040934a8826ab.txt", "contents": "\n\n\n109 2018 ACM/IEEE 40th International Conference on Software Engineering: New Ideas and Emerging Results 110\n\n ", "annotations": {"author": null, "publisher": null, "author_last_name": null, "author_first_name": null, "author_affiliation": null, "title": null, "venue": null, "abstract": null, "bib_ref": null, "figure": null, "paragraph": null, "formula": null, "table_ref": null, "section_header": null, "table": null, "figure_caption": null, "figure_ref": null, "bib_author_first_name": null, "bib_author_last_name": null, "bib_entry": null, "bib_title": null, "bib_author": null, "bib_venue": null}}}, "year": 2023, "month": 12, "day": 17}
