(1999) used Auto Regressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) timeseries analysis models based on Box-Jenkins method to formulate the forecasting model for the prediction of energy production and consumption in Asturias, Northern Spain [6].Hor et al. developed a multiple regression model for the prediction of load demand in England and Wales [7].Their aim was to provide an accurate model for a long-term prediction for the monthly demand and the evaluation of the model was done by using Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE).Asber et al. dealt with the development of a reliable and efficient Kernel regression model to forecast the load in the Hydro Qu\u00e9bec distribution network [8].Li Yingying et al. used principal component regression in power load forecasting for medium and long term [9].\n\nSince the 1980s, Artificial Neural Network (ANNs) methods have received a great deal of attention and were proposed as powerful computational tools to solve the load forecasting problem [11].AI-Saba and EI-Amin described the application of ANNs to long-term load forecasting, they produced results were close to the actual data while using the ANNs [12].Ghanhari et al proposed the application of ANNs and Regression Analysis (RA) for Iran\"s annual electricity load, using GDP and Population variables [13].Forecasting accuracy of each approach is evaluated by calculating Mean Absolute Error (MAE), the MAPE and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE).Bohman Kermanshahi et al. used multilayer Perceptron and recurrent neural networks for prediction of peak electric loads in Japan up to the year 2020, using variables such as gross national product, GDP, population, number of households, number of airconditioners, amount of CO2 pollution, index of industrial production, oil price, amount of energy consumption, electricity price, average temperature and maximum electric power of the previous year [14].Kadir Kavaklioglu modeled Turkey\"s electricity consumption using the support vector regression based on population, GDP, imports and Exports [15].Sackdara et al. used the RA and ANNs approaches for electricity demand forecasting, using GDP, number of population, number of household and electricity price variables and compared the two methods using MAPE [16].Azadeh and Ghaderi reported the application of ANNs, time series and ANOVA to forecast electricity consumption.They found that ANN has better predicted values for total energy consumption [17].Back propagation neural network used to predict the electricity consumption in which the load data and economic data can be acquired.However, the generalization performance of the network is reduced due to high dimension and serious relevance of the network, resulting in decreased prediction accuracy.The characteristics of principal component analysis method that can eliminate correlation between variables are used to analyze the principal component relations of observational data [18].The uncorrelated new variable, designed by principal component, account for the majority of the original variance.In recent years combining multiple linear regression with PCA and ANN with PCA, are being used to predict ozone concentration and load forecasting [20,18].\n\nIn this paper, electricity demand of India is forecasted by using RA, ANNs, combining RA with PC and combining ANNs with PC, which consider five input variables: Population, Per capita GDP, Imports, Exports and Per capita power consumption.This work reports, the use of a new technique using ANNs based on principal components, therefore combining statistical and artificial intelligence technique.This paper is organized as follows: section 2 describes selection of proper economic factors, section 3 describes proposed models, section 4 provides Simulation results and evaluation, finally section 5 concludes.\n\n\nSELECTION OF PROPER ECONOMIC FACTORS\n\nThe input variables are selected based on the correlation between the electricity demand and related parameters such as economic factors for long term load forecasting.After a careful investigation the following variables are selected as the input variables:\n\n1. Amount of CO 2 emission: Emission means the release of greenhouse gases and/or their precursors into the atmosphere over a specified area and period of time.The statistical coefficient of multiple determinations (R 2 value) for electricity demand vs. CO 2 emission is 0.998.2. Population: It is generally believed that a large population growth rate will bring a huge increase in total energy consumption.In India, with continuous improvement in the public revenue and living standards, energy consumption will increase with the steady growth of population and industrialization.R 2 value = 0.996\n\n\nMODELS\n\nMultiple linear regression (MLR) and ANNs are used to predict the long-term electricity consumption in India using above selected economic factors.These same models, but based on principal component analysis (PCA), are also used.The MLR method with PCA is referred as PCR and ANN with PCA is referred as PC-ANN.\n\nPCA was first proposed by Hotelling in 1933.PCA is a multivariate statistical method widely used in data analysis in diverge fields, because it is simple, nonparametric method.PCA is a variable reduction procedure.It involves a mathematical procedure that transform number of (possibility) correlated variables into a smallest number of uncorrelated variables called principle components (PC).The mathematical technique in PCA is called Eigen analysis: solve for the Eigen values and Eigen vectors of a square symmetric matrix with sums of squares and cross products.The Eigen vectors associated with the largest Eigen values have the same direction as the first PC.The Eigen vectors associated with the second largest Eigen values determines the direction of the second principle component.The sum of the Eigen values equals the trace of square matrix and the maximum number of Eigen vectors equals the number of rows (or columns) of this matrix.\n\nMLR is a technique used for modeling and analysis of numerical data.It is an analysis of values of a dependent variable based on the values of one or more independent variables [4].Linear regression is a form of RA in which observational data are modeled by a least squares function, which is a linear combination of the model parameters.In simple linear regression, the model function represents a straight line or parabola.The data model, which represents simple linear regression, can be written as, Y = aX 1 + bX 2 + e where, Y is the dependent variable (Electricity consumption), X 1 and X 2 are the independent variables (example: Population and Per capita GDP), \"a\" and \"b\" are the regression coefficients and \"e\" is the error term.The error term represents unexplained variation in the dependent variable and treated as a random variable.The parameters Population and Per capita GDP are estimated to give a best fit of the data.Typically, the best fit is evaluated by using the least squares method.Although these models are simply a linear and additive association of explanatory variables, they have been extensively used with satisfactory results [19].\n\nANNs are able to give better performance in dealing with the nonlinear relationships among their input variables [20].It is proved that the multilayer perceptron with error back propagation is an appropriate model for long-term load forecasting [13] also one hidden layer is enough to approximate any function [19], if presenting enough hidden nodes.Therefore, multilayer perceptron has been chosen in this paper and the input variables are selected based on the correlation technique.The multilayer perceptron consists of (i) input layer (ii) output layer (iii) one or more hidden layers containing nodes which help to capture the nonlinearity in the data.A Neural Network can be trained to perform particular function by adjusting the values of weights between elements so that a particular input leads to a specified target output.Therefore, the network is adopted, based on a comparison of the output and the target.Using supervised learning, these networks can learn the mapping between one data spaces to others.\n\nNormalization of data within a uniform range is essential (i) to prevent larger numbers from overriding smaller ones, and (ii) to prevent premature saturation of hidden nodes, which impedes the learning process [16].\n\nIn most cases, the ANNs are obtained using two distinct data sets: training and validation.The training data set is used to determine the network topology and the associated weights by solving a non-linear optimization problem with the objective function being dictated by the mean squared error (MSE).The validation data set is used to compute the ANN performance.Cross-validation is usually used to avoid the over fitting problem that often appears when applying ANN [19].The best network topology corresponds to an ANN, which presents a minimum value of MAPE for the validation data set.\n\nThe application of PC in ANN model aims to reduce the collinearity of the data sets, which can lead to worst predictions and to determine the relevant independent variables for the prediction of electricity consumption.The difference between PC-ANN approach and the ANN method is that the input variables are used in ANNs method and PC are used in PC-ANN method.Consequently, the network architecture will be less complex due to the decrease of input variables.\n\n\nSIMULATION RESULTS & EVALUATION\n\nThe input variables are selected based on the correlation coefficients between the electricity consumption and corresponding economic factors.These correlation coefficients provide the measure of the relation between the two variables.High correlation coefficient was found between these input variables and predicted output variables.Therefore these variables were used to provide the future electricity consumption in India.The statistical package for social studies (SPSS) are used for applying RA and ANNs and XLPro are used for applying PCA on a desktop PC with system configuration Intel Core2duo CPU, 2.67 GHZ with 1 GB RAM.\n\nRA and ANNs are used to predict the electricity consumption.These models are based on the original data (RA and ANNs) and on the PC (PCR and PC-ANNs).Table .1 shows the total variance of the original variables.The seven largest Eigen values in eleven characteristics roots exist in variable correlation matrix, respectively 10.072, 0.555, 0.341, 0.016, 0.010, 0.003, 0.002 and their cumulative contribution to the total explained variance is 99.99%.The first seven principal components provide the most information of original data and extracted.\n\nTable .2shows the components score coefficient matrix table reveals the system information of principal components with the original variables, which demonstrate the relative importance of each standardized predictors in the PC calculations.\n\nThe prediction of electricity consumption based on the eleven input variables such as Amount of CO2 emission, Population, Per capita GDP, Per capita gross national income, Gross Domestic savings, industry, Consumer price index, Whole sale price index , Imports, Exports and per capita power consumption.To apply the ANN model several network structure were tested to find most opt topology.The best architecture consisted of a three layer network with eleven neurons in the input and eight neurons in the hidden layer and one neuron in the output layer.Sigmoid and hyperbolic function were used as activation function in the neurons of hidden layer and output neurons.To evaluate the performance of the ANNs with back propagation algorithm (original variables as inputs) results are compared with the RA.Considering seven PC inputs, and applied for the above models.The best architecture consisted of a three layer network with eleven neurons in the input and eight neurons in the hidden layer and one neuron in the output layer.The forecasted models have enhanced accuracy due to applying PC-ANN.The reports on 17-th electric power survey of India predict the electricity consumption in the year 2016-2017 is 1190.1 BkWh.But the predicted electricity consumption calculated using PC-ANNs was 1186.086BkWh.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nForecasts are quite important for effective implementation of energy policies.In this paper, the net electricity consumption of India is modeled as a function of economic factors: Amount of CO2 emission, Population, Per capita GDP, Per capita gross national income, Gross Domestic savings, industry, Consumer price index, Wholesale price index, Imports, Exports and per capita power consumption.These economic factors (input variables) were selected through calculation of correlation coefficient.This way of selecting these factors for India is one of contribution of our paper.Two different approaches were used: one is original data, as input variables and the other is PC data as inputs.The results showed that the use of ANNs led to more accurate results than linear models (MLR and PCR).The electricity consumption is complex with multiple influencing factors, so regular prediction models do not well for its prediction due to the account of nonlinearities.The application of PC in this model was considered better than using the original data, because it reduced the number of inputs and therefore decreased the model complexity.Considering MLR and PCR, the statistical parameters were lower in PCR.PC-ANNs are better than ANNs, the use of PC based models was considered more efficient, due to elimination of collinearity problems and reduction of the number of inputs.So far less number of papers is available in the literature considering of PCA input for ANN, it is one of the major contribution of our paper.It was also verified that the proposed models PC-ANNs approach is suitable and accurate for prediction.Based on the results, it was better than other three models.In addition, the ANN model is flexible and can provide the optimal solution to predict the future demand.\n\n\n\n3.
