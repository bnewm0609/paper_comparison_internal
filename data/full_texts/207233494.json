On top of the huge amount of interconnected data, measuring relatedness between resources and identifying their relatedness could be used for various applications such as LOD-enabled recommender systems. In this paper, we propose various distance measures, on top of the basic concept of Linked Data Semantic Distance (LDSD), for calculating Linked Data semantic distance between resources that can be used in a LOD-enabled recommender system.

Web in machine-understandable format (primarily RDF [1]) related to different domains. The LOD has been adopted in recommender systems in order to improve the performance of such systems as well as reduce the cold-start problem inherent to recommender systems [2,8,[12][13][14]. Also, the need for a semantic representation of data and user profiles has been identified as one of the next challenges in the field of recommender systems [11]. The use of semantic data in recommendation tasks not only can provide better knowledge (e.g., a richer representation of data), but also can facilitate the easy adoption of the same approach to other domains [3]. Moreover, problems related to a keyword-based approach such as synonymy and polysemy are resolved since resources in LOD datasets are identified by unique URIs and semantically interlinked to each other [11]. All of the information within the LOD can be exploited and used in an LOD-enabled, content-based recommender system where the domain knowledge plays a fundamental role. In this regard, measuring the distance between resources and identifying their relatedness plays a significant role as it can be adopted to recommender systems for providing recommendations. To this end, various approaches to measure the distance/similarity between two resources in LOD datasets such as DBpedia 2 have been proposed [6,9,15,19]. Linked Data Semantic Distance (LDSD) [15] is one of the most popular approaches to measure the semantic distance between two resources, which has been adopted to a recommender system in the music domain [14]. Di Noia et. al [3,4] proposed applying one of the most popular models in information retrieval: the Vector Space Model (VSM) [17] in a LOD-based setting and representing the whole RDF graph as a matrix. Items and user profiles can be represented in terms of the VSM and the similarity between items and users can be identified by using the cosine similarity measure.\n\nIn this paper, based on the basic concept of LDSD, we present various semantic distance measures by incorporating the number of connected resources via a link, different normalization strategies and a statistical approach for calculating the semantic distance between two resources. We then evaluate these distance measures in the context of a recommender system that provides the top-N recommendations. It is noteworthy that although we performed our experiments using the DBpedia dataset, the distance mea-sures we proposed are not tied to this particular dataset and can be adopted to any similar LOD datasets as well.\n\nThe rest of the paper is organized as follows: Section 2 gives some related work. In Section 3 we propose various semantic distance measures for calculating the distance between two resources. Section 4 is dedicated to the evaluation and Section 5 presents the results. Finally, Section 6 concludes the paper and gives some ideas for future work.\n\n\nRELATED WORK\n\nMaedche et. al [10] defined a set of similarity measures for comparing ontology-based metadata by considering different aspects of an ontology separately. They propose differentiating across three dimensions for comparing two resources: taxonomic, relational and attribute similarities. However, the similarity measures depend on some strong assumptions about the model such as \"Ontologies are strictly hierarchical such that each concept is subsumed by only one concept\", which is not the case in terms of DBpedia. Passant [15] proposed a measure named LDSD to calculate semantic distance on Linked Data. The distance measure considers direct links from resource A to resource B and vice versa. In addition, it also considers the same incoming and outgoing nodes via the same properties of resources A and B in a graph. However, several aspects of relatedness that mentioned in this paper have been ignored. Leal et al. [9] presents an approach for computing the semantic relatedness of resources in DBpedia. In the paper, they proposed a similarity measure based on a notion of proximity, which measures how connected two resources are, rather than how distant they are. This means that the similarity measure considers both distance and paths between two nodes. However, they do not consider incoming nodes (resources) and properties of the resources as LDSD did. Based on the Shakti measure, Strobin et al. [19] propose a method to find the weights automatically by using Genetic Algorithms (GA) [18] based on a training dataset from Last.fm 3 . This method is quite efficient at learning the weights automatically. However, it needs a gold standard dataset (e.g., Last.fm dataset for the music domain) to learn the weights of properties which is not always available in other domains. There are also some supervised learning approaches based on VSM model for LOD-enabled recommender systems. Tommaso et. al [3] adapt the VSM model to a LOD-based setting and represent the whole RDF graph as a matrix. On top of the VSM representation, they use the Support Vector Machine as a classifer to predict if a user would like an item or not. Using the same representation, they also propose to assign a weight to each property that represents its worth with respect to the user profile [4]. In this regard, they use GA to learn the weights of properties that minimize the misclassification errors. Our study is different from these model-based approaches since we focused on the top-N recommendation task while they focused on the prediction task. In addition, our proposed distance measures can be easily adopted in different domains since they do not require any learning process with a gold standard dataset. However, adaptive algorithms such as GA can also be applied to the semantic distance measures to learn the different weights of various 3 http://last.fm paths (e.g., direct or indirect paths with different lengths). This, although interesting, is beyond the scope of this paper and we aim to explore it in future work.\n\n\nLINKED DATA SEMANTIC DISTANCE MEASURES\n\nLDSD was one of the first approaches for measuring the semantic distance between two resources on LOD datasets such as DBpedia and used for recommender systems [15]. The distance measure (equation (1)) considers direct links from resource ra to resource r b and vice versa. In addition, it also considers the same incoming and outgoing nodes via the same properties of resource ra and r b . The distance measure has a scale from 0 to 1, where a larger value denotes less similarity between two resources. We use the definition of a dataset following the Linked Data principles outlined in [14] and the definition of a path as below: LDSD consists of two C d functions with Cii(li, ra, r b ) and Cio(li, ra, r b ). C d is a function that computes the number of direct and distinct links between resources in a graph G. C d (li, ra, r b ) equals 1 if there is a link li from resource ra to resource r b . Otherwise, if there is no link from resource ra to resource r b , C d (li, ra, r b ) equals to 0. By extension C d can be the total number of nodes via li from ra (C d (li, ra)). For example, in the example graph ( Fig. 1), we have:\nDefinition 1. A dataset following the Linked Data prin- ciples is a graph G such as G = (R, L) in which R = {r1, r2, ...C d (l inf luences , r Ariana Grande , r Selena Gomez ) = 1 C d (l inf luences , r Ariana Grande ) = 1 C d (l musicalguests , r List of T he T onight Show with Jay Leno episodes (2013\u221214) ) = 2\nCii and Cio are functions that compute the number of indirect and distinct links, both incoming and outgoing, between resources in a graph G. Cii(li, ra, r b ) equals 1 if there is a resource rn linked to both ra and r b via an incoming property li, and 0 if not. Similarly, Cio(li, ra, r b ) equals 1 if there is a resource rn linked to both ra and r b via an outgoing property li, and 0 if not. By extension Cii and Cio can be used to compute the total number of resources linked indirectly to ra via li (Cii(li, ra) and Cio(li, ra)). In the example (Fig. 1), we have Cii(l musicalguests , r Ariana Grande , r Selena Gomez ) = 1\n\n(via incoming property from r List of T he T onight Show with Jay Leno episodes (2013\u221214) ) and On top of the basic concept of LDSD, we propose four different distance measures incorporating various aspects of relatedness between two resources (Section 3.2-3.5).\nLDSD(ra, r b ) = 1 1 + i C d (l i ,ra,r b ) 1+log(C d (l i ,ra)) + i C d (l i ,r b ,ra) 1+log(C d (l i ,r b )) + i C ii (l i ,ra,r b ) 1+log(C ii (l i ,ra)) + i C io (l i ,ra,r b ) 1+log(C io (l i ,ra)) (1)\n\nLinked Data Semantic Distance incorporating the number of linked resources via a link\n\nIn this section, we introduce LDSD\u03b1 (equation (2)) that incorporates the number of resources linked to ra and r b via li. C ii (C io ) of LDSD\u03b1, is equal to the number of resources linked to ra and r b via an incoming (outgoing) property li while Cii (Cio) of LDSD equals 1 if there is a resource rn linked to ra and r b via an incoming (outgoing) property li. The intuition behind this is that two resources are more similar if there are a greater number of linked resources via a property li. For instance, if two music artists have 10 dbpedia:MusicalArtist(s) in common via the property dbpedia-owl:associatedMusicalArtist, then they are more similar than two other music artists that have 1 dbpedia:MusicalArtist in common via the same property. The prefix dbpedia is used for the namespace http://dbpedia.org/resource/ and the prefix dbpedia-owl is used for the namespace http://dbpedia.org/ontology/.\n\n\nLinked Data Semantic Distance with normalizations considering both resources\n\nIn our previous study [16], we showed that LDSD with normalizations considering both resources can produce symmetric results for ra and r b and the reversed order of them, which is an important property as a distance measure [7]. On top of LDSD\u03b1, we further modify the normalizations of C ii and C io by considering both resources ra and r b (see equation (3)). That is, the normalization of C ii is carried out by the average of Cii(li, ra) and Cii(li, r b ) while for Cii in LDSD it is carried out by considering the first resource ra only. Similarly, the normalization of C io is carried out by the average of Cio(li, ra) and Cio(li, r b ). We use LDSD \u03b2 to refer to the distance measure in the rest of the paper.\n\n\nLinked Data Semantic Distance with global normalizations\n\nThese aforementioned distance measures use local normalizations, i.e., normalizations that are carried out in the local context of ra and r b . Instead of using local normalizations, we use global normalizations of a path to investigate the impact on calculating the distance between two resources. The distance measure can be defined as equation (4) and we use LDSD\u03b3 to refer to the distance measure in the rest of the paper.\n\nThis measure penalizes the importance of a path between two resources according to the global appearances of the path in the whole graph. In LDSD, the normalizations of C d (li, ra, r b ) and C d (li, r b , ra) are carried out using C d (li, ra) that computes the number of resources rn from ra via li LDSD\u03b1(ra, r b ) = 1\n1 + i C d (l i ,ra,r b ) 1+log(C d (l i ,ra)) + i C d (l i ,r b ,ra) 1+log(C d (l i ,r b )) + i C ii (l i ,ra,r b ) 1+log(C ii (l i ,ra)) + i C io (l i ,ra,r b ) 1+log(C io (l i ,ra)) (2) LDSD \u03b2 (ra, r b ) = 1 1 + i C d (l i ,ra,r b ) 1+log(C d (l i ,ra)) + i C d (l i ,r b ,ra) 1+log(C d (l i ,r b )) + i C ii (l i ,ra,r b ) 1+log( C ii (l i ,ra )+C ii (l i ,r b ) 2 ) + i C io (l i ,ra,r b ) 1+log( C io (l i ,ra )+C io (l i ,r b ) 2 )(3)\nLDSD\u03b3(ra, r b ) = 1\n1 + i C d (l i ,ra,r b ) 1+log(C dp (l i )) + i C d (l i ,r b ,ra) 1+log(C dp (l i )) + i j C ii (l i ,r j ,ra,r b ) 1+log(C iip (l i ,r j )) + i j C io (l i ,r j ,ra,r b ) 1+log(C iop (l i ,r j )) (4) LDSDLLR(ra, r b ) = 1 1 + i L d (li, ra, r b ) + i L d (li, r b , ra) + i j Lii(li, rj, ra, r b ) + i j Lio(li, rj, ra, r b ) (5)\nr a r n l i (see Fig. 2). In contrast, in LDSD\u03b3, the normalizations of C d functions are carried out using C dp (li) that computes the global appearances of the path li between any two resources in DBpedia (see Fig. 3). Furthermore, for indirect paths between two resources, LDSD\u03b3 normalizes each indirect path by the number of global appearances of it. Taking incoming indirect paths for example, Cii(li, rj, ra, r b ) equals 1 if there is a path l (i)i , rj, l (o)i from ra to r b , and 0 if not. The normalization of Cii(li, rj, ra, r b ) is then carried out using Ciip(li, rj) that computes the global appearances of the path l (i)i , rj, l (o)i between any two resources in DBpedia (see Fig. 5).\n\n\nLinked Data Semantic Distance by loglikelihood\n\nIn this section, we adopt a statistical approach, log-likelihood ratio [5] for measuring the semantic distance between two resources. The approach is adopted and implemented as a similarity metric named log-likelihood similarity in the Apache Mahout 4 , which is a widely known open source project to build an environment for creating machine learning appli-4 http://mahout.apache.org/ cations with scalable performance as well as collaborative filtering based recommender systems. We adopt the implementation of the similarity in Mahout for our experiment.\n\nThe log-likelihood similarity is good at handling rare events. In our approach, we treat a resource and direct/indirect paths of it appearing in a graph as an event. The distance measure can be defined as equation (5) and we use LDSDLLR to refer to this measure in the rest of the paper. L d (li, ra, r b ) denotes the log-likelihood ratio of two events [5]: an event for the resource ra with the path [l (o)i ] and the other event for the resource r b with the path [l (i)i ]. Similarly, Lii(li, rj, ra, r b ) denotes the log-likelihood ratio of two events: the resource ra with the incoming link li from a resource rj, and the resource r b with the incoming link li from the resource rj.\n\n\nEVALUATION SETUP\n\nWe evaluate the proposed semantic distance measures in terms of the performance of recommender systems when using them as recommendation algorithms. To this end, we use a subset of the dataset from the second Linked Open Dataenabled recommender systems challenge 5 . The dataset was collected from Facebook 6 profiles about personal preferences (\"likes\") in the music domain, which consists of 52,072 users and 21 liked items on average. The items available in the dataset have been mapped to their corresponding DBpedia URIs. We randomly select 500 users with 10,590 preference records for the experiment. The main details of the dataset from the challenge and its subset for our experiment are presented in Table 1.\n\nFor each user, 5 liked items were blinded out to construct a candidate list for recommendations while the rest of the items were used to construct preference profiles of users. In the end, the candidate list consists of 1,132 items of type dbpedia:MusicalArtist or dbpedia:MusicalBand.\n\nA user profile can be represented as a set of resources that they liked before (equation (6)). The similarity between a user ui and an item can be measured using equation (7) where dist(ra, r b ) denotes the distance measure deployed in the recommender system. \nP rofile(ui) = {r1, r2, ..., rm}(6)sim(ui, ra) = r b \u2208P rof ile(u i ) (1 \u2212 dist(ra, r b )) |P rofile(ui)|(7)\nThe recommender system then provides the top-N recommendations based on the similarity of a user profile and an item from the candidate list. We evaluate the performance of the recommender system using our proposed distance measures and taking LDSD as a baseline. Additionally, a modelbased approach [3] for RDF data with VSM [17] is adopted as another baseline. The model considers all properties of items (resources) that a user liked, where each resource is represented as a unique vector of weights and each weight indicates the degree of association between the item and the resource with respect to a property. In this regard, both items and users can be represented in terms of the VSM. We then use the cosine similarity measure for measuring the similarities between a user and an item. Finally, we add an item-based collaborative filtering (ITEMCF ) approach with log-likelihood similarity in Mahout as another baseline which does not exploit LOD.\n\nThe performance of DBpedia provides a large set of properties for each item. Hence, selecting a subset of domain-dependent properties is necessary [4,12]. Referring to the music domain, in which we performed the evaluation, we selected the 15 properties (see Table 2) for calculating the semantic distance between resources. dct:subject relates a resource to its categories. In addition, we decided to leverage the properties belonging to the DBpedia Ontology since they represent high-quality, clean and well-structured information [13]. The prefix dct is used for the namespace http://purl.org/dc/terms/subject.  \n\n\nRESULTS\n\n\nMean Reciprocal Rank\n\n(c) MRR Figure 6: Results of the recommender system using different distance measures (solid lines) and baseline methods (dashed lines). Figure  6(c) shows the MRR results of the recommender system. The paired t-test is used for testing the significance where the significance level was set to 0.05 unless otherwise noted.\n\nOverall, LDSD\u03b3 performs best, which considers global appearances of paths within the whole graph, followed by LDSD \u03b2 and LDSD\u03b1. More specifically, the R@5, 10 have improved significantly (p < 0.01), as well as R@20 using LDSD\u03b3 compared to using LDSD. Also, the R@10 has improved significantly by using LDSD \u03b2 compared to using LDSD. Similar observations can be found in the precision results. LDSDLLR performs worst among these proposed distance measures, and worse than LDSD. All of the proposed distance measures perform significantly better than the VSM model with cosine similarity measure. In addition, we can observe the improvements by exploiting LOD based on the recall and precision results compared to using the ITEMCF approach.\n\nIn terms of MRR (see Figure 6(c)), LDSD\u03b1, LDSD \u03b2 and LDSD\u03b3 have similar performance and the performance is significantly better than the VSM model with cosine similarity measure and slightly better than LDSD and ITEMCF (but not significant).\n\nThe results show that incorporating the number of linked resources and adopting different normalization strategies such as local normalizations by considering both resources (LDSD \u03b2 ), and the global normalizations of paths (LDSD\u03b3) can improve the performance of the recommender system. In addition, the best performance achieved by LDSD\u03b3 indicates that global normalizations of paths represent the importance of paths better than local ones of them.\n\n\nCONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK\n\nIn this paper, we proposed and investigated various semantic distance measures for calculating the distance between resources. These measures were adopted into a LOD-based recommender system to recommend the top-N items to users based on the preference of a user. We found that the performance of the recommender system is significantly improved by incorporating the number of resources via indirect paths, local normalizations considering both resources (LDSD \u03b2 ) and global appearances of paths (LDSD\u03b3) compared to baseline methods.\n\nIn the future, we plan to extend the algorithms by incorporating longer paths, in order to recommend items that are more than one node away from the seed one. Moreover, paths with different lengths would contribute to the semantic distance in a different way and the weights of them can be optimized by using GA as we mentioned in Section 2.\n\n\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\n\nThis publication has emanated from research conducted with the financial support of Science Foundation Ireland (SFI) under Grant Number SFI/12/RC/2289 (Insight Centre for Data Analytics).\n\nSAC 2016 ,\n2016April 04-08, 2016, Pisa, Italy c 2016 ACM.
