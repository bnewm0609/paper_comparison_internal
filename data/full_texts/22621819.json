INTRODUCTION\n\nAs a common example of complex systems, social networks can be represented as graphs with sets of nodes and edges. Communities often form a significant substructure in such systems and a typical community can be described as a subset of nodes within which the connections are dense, but between which are sparse [1]. Usually, in the analysis of social networks, the identification of communities can help finding groups of users with similar interests, backgrounds or purposes, which effectively supports the advanced application of social networks such as recommender systems. Therefore, community detection is a basic and essential step in social network analysis [21].\n\nMost existing community detection methods only focus on the topological structure, which is indispensable infor-mation of networks. However, for such conventional community detection methods, it is not sufficient to partition users in social networks merely according to the topological connections because users may choose different communities for different reasons and such property cannot be reflected in topology. Furthermore, two users in the social network may belong to the same community even though they have not had any direct contact.\n\nIn order to compensate for possible deficiencies of only using the topological information, one can supplement it with the content information, among which the node attributes are the most readily available and commonly used. For instance, user's personal profile, interest tags and comments are all typical node attributes of content information. (Please note that while in this paper we only consider node attributes, the edge attributes are another source of information that we intend to use in the future.) Such content information can be effectively used to improve community detection results since it provides orthogonal information to network topology [26]. Moreover, the content information can simultaneously help to obtain semantic description of communities during the community detection process.\n\nFor the above reasons, some state-of-the-art community detection methods have started to integrate these two aspects of the social networks' related information. However, most of the existing semantic methods are based on the assumption that the topological structure is compatible with the content information. In fact, there is no evidence that the topology and content must share the same characteristics in any case and the mismatch between them is common in social networks. For instance, according to [20], in the application using data from Twitter, the real social relationship reflects the community structure more directly than the content as the messages generated by users can be very diverse. Moreover, our preexperiment shown in Section III also indicates the mismatch between topology and content in social networks, and it further shows that when these two types of information do not match well, methods attempting to integrate the topology and content may lack the required robustness and often lead to poor results.\n\nIn spite of the mismatch between the topology and content, our pre-experiment shows that if we effectively control the contribution of content, the community structure can still be accurately extracted. Therefore, we propose a new Adaptive Semantic Community Detection (ASCD) method, which integrates topological structure and content information of social networks under the framework of non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) [11]. Moreover, compared to some other stateof-the-art methods [5] [8] [18] [19], our method obtains better robustness, as we have introduced a novel adaptive parameter to control the trade-off between topology and content. We then derive the effective multiplicative updating rules for our model to facilitate the extraction of communities and their semantic interpretation at the same time.\n\nThe experiment on a sort of artificial network [1] shows that our ASCD method has better ability to resist mismatch between topology and content. The case study on a real social network [8] demonstrates that our method is also able to simultaneously obtain corresponding semantic description when communities are partitioned. Finally, the evaluation on real social network datasets [16] [17] shows that our ASCD method outperforms some state-of-the-art community detection methods.\n\nIn the rest of this paper, we will discuss related work in Section II and then present our ASCD method in Section III. Specifically, in Section III we first describe the model combining the topology and content part of the network. Then followed by using a simplified uniform model, we introduce a pre-experiment to illustrate and discuss the mismatch phenomenon. Finally, we proposed our ASCD method with corresponding solution strategy. Thereafter, three evaluation experiments are conducted and described in Section IV, including: (i) an evaluation on artificial networks with mismatches between network topology and content information; (ii) a case study concerned with semantic description; and (iii) an evaluation on real social network datasets.\n\n\nII. RELATED WORK\n\nIn more than a decade, several methods have been proposed for the task of discovering the community structure in networks and a comprehensive review of different community detection methods can be found in [21].\n\nConventional methods mainly explore the topological structure of network to achieve the community partition, and some well-known approaches include hierarchical clustering methods mentioned in [1] and [2], spectral clustering method discussed in [3], optimal method concerned with modularity proposed in [4] and related statistical inference method of [5], [6] and [23]. However, such conventional methods may have limited performance as they only focus on the structural information of the network while entirely neglecting the content information.\n\nTherefore, the incorporation of topology and content has been observed among some of the recent state-of-the-art methods. For instance, the method proposed in [7] partitions community structure by defining and fusing the similarity of linkage and content, [9] introduces an algorithm with two main phases to consider topology and content respectively, [20] tries to combine topology with content by using graph regularization method, and method in [24] integrates semantic information in the context of content propagation. However, by incorporating topological and content information, such stateof-the-art methods only aim at improving the community partition. In practice, in order to obtain the semantic description of communities, additional steps still need to be taken to infer relevant attributes for communities. On the other hand, under the framework of NMF, [8] has proposed a community detection method which combines topology with content and also has the ability to simultaneously obtain the community partition and corresponding semantic description.\n\nHowever, most methods that incorporate topology and content may be based on the assumption that content information is consistent with topological structure. In fact, [25] indicates that different content may have different influence on the partition of communities. More importantly, [20] and [26] both state that the mismatch between topology and content is common in social networks. And when the mismatch between them occurs, methods based on match assumption may result in poor community partition. This is the problem which forms the main focus of this paper.\n\n\nIII. THE MODEL\n\nGenerally, we consider the case of an undirected and unweighted graph G with N nodes, and taking the content information into account, we assume the nodes attributes and communities' semantic description are represented by Bag-of-Words model with M key words in total. We use an adjacency matrix\nN Nu A\nto represent the network connectivity, where A ij =1 when node i is connected to node j, and otherwise A ij =0. To represent content of individual nodes, we introduce a network attribute matrix\nM Nu C\n, where C is =1 when node i's attribute has word s, and otherwise C is =0. As in our method, the number of communities needs to be set in advance, so we generally assume there are K communities in the network. And then we respectively model the topological structure and content information under the framework of NMF.\n\n\nA. Modeling Topological Structure\n\nFor an appropriate representation of the community partitions, we define a community membership matrix K Nu X , where X ir is the propensity that the node i belongs to community r. Since the number of edges between any pair of nodes is either 0 or 1, the expected number of edges between the nodes i and j in the community r is X ir X jr , and similarly in the network the expected number of edges between such pair is\n\u00a6 K r jr ir 1 X X\n. In fact, the expected number of edges between two nodes should be as close as possible to the real value of A ij , so we have the following objective function related to the topological structure:\n2 min arg F T XX A X s.t. X ir \u22650.(1)\n\nB. Modeling Content Information\n\nIn order to give the corresponding semantic descriptions of communities, we define a community attribute matrix\nK M u Y\n, where Y sr represent the propensity that the com-munity r can be described by the key word s. Similarly, from the perspective of a generative model, the expectation that the node i belongs to the community r and can be described by the key word s is X ir Y sr , so 1 K ir sr r \u00a6 X Y represents the expectation that the node i has the key word s in the network. Since, the value of C is should also be as close as possible to the expectation value, we then have the following objective function related to the content information:\n2 , min arg F T XY C Y X s.t. X ir \u22650, Y sr \u22650.(2)\nOn the other hand, the same as the modeling process in [8], if the semantic description of the node i is highly similar to that of the community r, then the node i should have high propensity of belonging to the community r (which implies that the topological structure is consistent with the content information). Namely, the value of \u00a6 M s sr is 1 Y C should be as close as possible to X ir . Therefore, we can formulate another objective function as:\n2 , min arg F CY X Y X s.t. X ir \u22650, Y sr \u22650.(3)\nAlthough the premise of (3) that the topology and content are consistent in the network may not be valid, and it is also not strictly an NMF problem, since the base matrix (the base matrix and the coefficient matrix are defined in the NMF problem [11]) C in (3) is the known quantity when a network is given, we still use it as a candidate for further discussion.\n\nFor semantic description, we also need to make another reasonable assumption that the key words used to describe the same community should be semantically similar, but in contrast, the description between different communities should be distinguishable. To satisfy such property, we need to introduce an additional sparsity penalty for matrix Y, based on the work of Sparse Non-Negative Matrix Factorization (SNMF) [12]. However, the objective function in (2) is not suitable to introduce such sparsity item for Y, because the sparsity of X do not need to be guaranteed, and under the framework of SNMF, without considering the sparsity of the base matrix X, we cannot ensure the sparsity of the coefficient matrix Y, even if we introduce a sparsity penalty for it. But for (3), the base matrix C is sparse as it is used to describe individual node attributes. Therefore, we have the following new optimization problem and the objective function related to the content by using (2) and introducing a sparsity item for Y:\n\u00a6 K r F r 1 2 1 2 , :, min arg Y CY X Y X O s.t. X ir \u22650,Y sr \u22650 (4)\nwhere \u03bb is a non-negative parameter to adjust the contribution of the sparsity item.\n\n\nC. The Mismatch Effect in Social Networks\n\nBased on the separate models of topology and content, we can now introduce a uniform model that integrates both aspects, but in order to have a further discussion about the mismatch between them, we first combine (1) with (3) and achieve the following optimization problem and its simplified objective function:\n2 2 , min arg F F T CY X XX A Y X D s.t. X ir \u22650,Y sr \u22650.(5)\nwhere \u03b1 is the parameter to adjust the trade-off between the first and second term in (5). Obviously, the community membership matrix X in the first term corresponds to the topological structure, while the community attribute matrix Y in the second term corresponds to the content information. Our goal is to find the optimal value of X and Y that minimizes (5).\n\nThe general solution strategy of an NMF problem is to properly initialize the unknown quantities, and use certain rules of iteration to continuously update their value until convergence. Before formally updating, additional initialization steps usually need to be taken to speed up convergence. So we first initialize the community membership matrix X by using objective function (1), and use the method similar to the solution method of (14), (15) and (16) (which will be discussed later) to derive the following updating rule: ir\nT ir ir ir X XX AX X X m .(6)\nTo initialize X, we first set the value of X randomly and use (6) to update X until it converges. Similarly, we can initialize the community attribute matrix Y by solving the following optimization problem (7), where we replace the X which encoded the information about topology in (2) with another matrix\nK Nu Z to eliminate the influence of topolog- ical structure. 2 , min arg F T ZY C Y Z s.t. Z ir \u22650, Y sr \u22650(7)\nUnder such circumstance, Z ir represents the propensity that the node i belongs to the \"topic\" r. Although the topics hidden in content may not be consistent with the community partition, to have an appropriate initialization of the content independent of the topology, we still randomly set Z and Y first, and similar to the derivation of (14), (15) and (16) (which will be discussed later), we use the following two updating rules in turn: ir\nT ir ir ir Y ZY CY Z Z m , sr T sr T sr sr Z YZ Z C Y Y m .(8)\nAfter initializing X and Y, we start to derive their respective updating rules for the uniform model defined in (5). As (5) is not convex, to get the optimal solution we use the same solution strategy as in [8] to, in turn, take the following two steps. First, we fix the value of Y and update X with the rule (9). Secondly, we fix X and update Y with the rule (10). The derivation processes are similar to those of (14), (15) and (16) (which will be discussed later). ir\nT T ir ir ir Y XY X XX CY AX X X m D D 2 2 (9) sr T sr T sr sr X YX X C Y Y m .(10)\nBased on such initialization and solution strategy, we introduce our pre-experiment on a real social network to discuss the different influences of semantic information with different trade-offs between topology and content. In the experiment, we adopted the modularity [13] as our evaluation metric, which can be used to evaluate the community structure of a network, with the quantitative relation that the larger the value of modularity is, the better community structure the network has. In this pre-experiment we have used the LASTFM data set [8] collected from an online music social network for the evaluation purposes (details of the data set can be found in Section IV).\n\nTo highlight the influence of content, we executed initialization step of X 10 times, and adopted the average modularity as the baseline. Then, for the trade-off parameter \u03b1, we respectively set \u03b1=1, \u03b1=20, \u03b1=40, \u03b1=60 and \u03b1=80. For each parameter setting we used the solution strategy introduced above to get the optimal solution, and for the first 100 iterations, we calculated and recorded the modularity value of each iteration according to the current X. Finally, we obtained the convergence curves of the modularity shown in Figure 1.\n\nFor Figure 1, when \u03b1=1, the topology part and the content part of (5) have the same contribution, but the value of modu-larity decreases dramatically in the first several iterations, and finally converges to a very low level for which there is a big gap to the base line. Such decrease of modularity reflects the fact that the introduction of the content in the uniform model has a very negative impact on the extracted community structure, which is a typical example of the mismatch between the topology and content.\n\nHowever, when \u03b1>1, which means that the contribution of the topology in (5) is larger than that of the respective content, although we can still observe a decrease of the modularity value in the first several iterations, the modularity finally recovers to a higher level, and the larger the value of \u03b1 is the faster the modularity will recover. Especially when \u03b1=40, \u03b1=60 and \u03b1=80 the modularity finally reaches the base line level. Given these results we can conclude that despite the mismatch between the topology and content, we can still control the damage to the community structure if we appropriately set the trade-off between them. More importantly, the greater the degree of mismatch, the greater contribution the topology part of the objective function should have.  (5) in the first 100 iterations with respect to \u03b1=1, \u03b1=20, \u03b1=40, \u03b1=60 and \u03b1=80. When \u03b1=1 (the topology and content in (5) have the same contribution) the modularity value dramatically decreases and finally converges to a low level having a big gap to the desirable baseline. When \u03b1>1 (the topology in (5) has greater contribution than the content), although modularity decreases in the first several iterations, it finally recovers to a higher level.\n\n\nD. The ASCD Uniform Model\n\nBased on the conclusion reached in our pre-experiment, we can now propose our ASCD uniform model. As we respectively initialize X and Y, and we use (3) but not (2) as the content part of the uniform model (5), when the initialization step finishes or after each iteration, the value of (2) can reflect the degree of mismatch between topology and content, namely the larger the value of (2), the greater the degree of mismatch. Because the value of (2) is not only related to the mismatch degree but also the size of the network, we introduce the following function to get an average value of (2) and to eliminate the effect of the network size:\nNM d F T 2 , XY C Y X .(11)\nAccording to our pre-experiment, we combine (11) with a monotonically decreasing function of arctan which ranges between 0 to 1 to derive the following adaptive penalty parameter to control the contribution of the content: 1\n, arctan 2 , S G Y X Y X d f(12)\nwhere \u03b4 is the parameter to adjust the value of d(X,Y). To demonstrate the effectiveness of such adaptive parameter used to control the trade-off between the topology and content (such parameter directly control the contribution of content part in the uniform model), we set \u03b4=1, and set d(X,Y) as the independent variable to draw the function curve of (12) which is shown in Figure 2.\n\nAccording to Figure 2, if the degree of mismatch is large, the parameter's value will be small, and the contribution of the content can be effectively controlled. On the other hand, when the degree of mismatch is small, the value of (12) will be relatively large, so the content part can fully play its role. By adding such parameter and the sparse item discussed in (4), we have formulated the following optimization problem and objective function of our Adaptive Semantic Community Detection (ASCD) method:\n\u00a6 t t K j t F t t F T t t j f 1 2 1 2 2 0 , 0 :, min arg Y CY X X X A Y X O(13)\nwhere f is the simplified representation of f(X (t-1) ,Y (t-1) ), and the subscript of X (t) and Y (t) represents their corresponding value in the t-th iteration (t=0,1,2, ). Especially, subscript 0 infers the value after initialization, and t in (13) should start from 1. Notice that (13) is only defined for the t-th iteration in our ASCD model, since the value of f is dependent on X (t-1) and Y (t-1) , which may differ in different iterations. In order to achieve the optimal solution of (13), we use the same strategy as in [8] to solve such non-convex problem, and take the following two steps.\n\n\n1) Updating X with Y fixed\n\nFirst, we fix the value of Y and solve the following optimisation problem only related to X:\n2 2 0 min arg F F T f O CY X XX A X X t .(14)\nBy using the property that . (17) 2) Updating Y with X fixed Then we fix X and derive the updating rule of Y, and similarly get the optimization problem and objective function only related to Y:\n\u00a6 t K j F j f O 1 2 1 2 0 :, min arg Y CY X Y Y O .(18)\nFor the sparse item of 1-norm in (18), we used the same method of solving SNMF problem as in [8] and [12], and derive another equivalent objective function:\n2 2 1 1 ' ' F F M k f Y f O Y C X e C 0 X Y \u00bb \u00bc \u00ba \u00ab \u00ac \u00aa \u00bb \u00bc \u00ba \u00ab \u00ac \u00aa u u O (19)\nwhere 0 1\u00d7K is a K-dimensional row vector whose elements all equal 0, while e 1\u00d7M is an M-dimensional row vector whose elements are all 1. We then derive the partial derivative of O(Y) with respect to Y: w\nw [.] [.] ' ' 2 ' ' 2 X C Y C C Y Y T T f f O . (20)\nFinally, using the derivation method the same as in (16) and (17), we derive the following updating rule for Y:   (13) in the first 100 iterations in artificial network analysis (discussed in Section IV). Both of the values converge fast in the first several iterations, which indicate that by using the update rule (17) and (21), even though f is non-fixed, the convergence can still be ensured.\n>@ >@ sr t T sr t T sr t sr sr sr t sr t Y C C X C Y Y Y ' ' ' ' .\nTo ensure non-negative constraint for X, before using the updating rule (17) and (21), we should set the diagonal elements of A larger than 0.5. The overall algorithm of our ASCD method is shown in TABLE I.\n\nFor the updating rules of (17) and (21), if the value of f is fixed in all iterations, the convergence of them can be proved as in [14], since they are based on gradient descent method. But for a non-fixed value of f, to ensure the convergence, we can still give two convergence curves with respect to the values of f and (13) in Figure 3. Such two curves reflect the change of corresponding values in the first 100 iterations in one of the artificial network analyses discussed in Section IV. As shown in Figure 3, by using the updating rules of (17) and (21), the value of adaptive parameter f and objective function (13) both converge fast in the first several iterations. Therefore, the convergence of updating rule (17) and (21) is guaranteed.  Calculate adaptive parameter f(X,Y) according to (12) Update X according to (17) Update Y according to (21) end while\n\n\nALGORITHM OF ADAPTIVE SEMANTIC COMMUNITY DETECTION\n\n\nAlgorithm of ASCD (Adaptive Semantic Community\n\n\nIV. EXPERIMENTAL EVALUATION\n\n\nA. Artificial Network Analysis\n\nTo generally evaluate our method's capacity to resist mismatch effect, we used the model proposed in [1] to generate random networks. For an artificial network, we generated 128 nodes and partitioned them into 4 communities. Each node has 8 edges connecting to nodes of the same community (z in ) and 8 edges to those of different communities (z out ) (which can be seen as the noise of topology), with a total of 16 edges (z) per node. For content, we set the total number of attributes to be 128, and assumed that there were 4 topics which have a oneto-one correlation to the 4 communities. For each node, we generated a 128-demensional binary attributes but only used 32 attributes as its content (h) (only the value of 32 elements in the 128-demsional vector are one and others are zero), and we set the number of attributes not related to corresponding topic to be 8 (h out ) (which can be seen as the noise of content). (So the number of attributes related to topic is 24 (h in ).) Because of the one-to-one correlation between topology and content, under such setting, the topology and content of the network are consistent.\n\nTo simulate the mismatch between topology and content, we randomly select a certain proportion of nodes to swap their attribute vectors, in which we introduced a parameter \u03c1 mis to represent such proportion. In fact, \u03c1 mis controls the degree of mismatch between topology and content. Namely, the larger the value of \u03c1 mis is, the larger the degree of this mismatch will be. Especially, when \u03c1 mis =1, all nodes in the network may be randomly selected to swap their attribute vectors, which represents the maximal degree of mismatch that we can control. Therefore, we set \u03c1 mis to values within the range of 0 to 1 with step size of 0.1.\n\nIn addition to our ASCD method, we used the initialization result of community membership X as the baseline (NMF method), because the initialization of X is only related to topology. And we also used the SCI method [8], which integrates topology and content as the comparative method. We adopted normalized mutual information (NMI) [15] and accuracy (AC) [15] as the evaluation metrics.\n\nMoreover, there may be still some uncertainties in such sort of artificial networks. In order to achieve a relatively stable result, we generated 50 samples at each point of \u03c1 mis varying from 0 to 1, and then we respectively evaluated each sampled network. We finally used the average results which are shown in Figure 4.  Fig. 4. Performance comparison of NMF, SCI and ASCD for \u03c1 mis varies from 0 to 1, with NMI (left) and AC (right) metrics. NMF is the baseline, which depends on topology alone. SCI is the comparative method integrates topology and content. ASCD is our method. \u03c1 mis is the parameter to control the degree of mismatch. Our method steadily keeps at a level that outperforms the baseline, but the comparative method seriously deteriorates as \u03c1 mis increases.\n\nAs shown in Figure 4, both metrics indicate a consistent result. Although the SCI method outperforms ASCD when \u03c1 mis =0, its performance seriously deteriorates as \u03c1 mis increases and finally there is a big gap between the base line level for large \u03c1 mis values. In other words, methods (such as SCI) that give the same weigh to the topological and content information may perform even worse than those which only depend on topology. On the other hand, the performance of our ASCD method steadily keep at a level that outperforms the baseline, even when mismatch between the topology and content is large. In short, by adding the adaptive parameter to control the trade-off between the topology and content, our ASCD method robustly combines such two sources of information and maintains a very high level of performance even when a significant mismatch between the topology and content exists.\n\n\nB. Case Study of Semantic Description\n\nWe used the LASTFM data set [8] as the experimental data set, which is collected from an online music platform last.fm and includes users' friend relationship and interest tags. After necessary preprocessing, we got a network of 1,892 users with 12,712 friend relations, and a total of 9,749 tag key words. As it was done in [8], we set the number of communi-ties K=38, and for our ASCD model we set the parameter \u03b4=0.1 and \u03bb=0.01. For all communities we selected the top 10 key words to draw their corresponding word clouds. Four examples of semantic description are shown in Figure 5. For the community in Figure 5 (a), the main topic is metal music, as the key words \"metallica\", \"wolf metal\" and \"epic metal\" are directly related to it. Moreover, \"megadeth\" is a band famous for thrash metal, and \"jimmy pages firm\" infers a member of the Led Zeppelin band who played a vital role in the development of metal music. Some materials from the music genres development history also point out that \"finish rock\" has made a great contribution to the heavy metal and extreme metal genres.\n\nCommunity shown in Figure 5 (b) may be related to pop music, just as the key words \"classic pop\", \"dance-pop\", and \"pop/rock\" infer, and \"michael jackson\" is an acknowledged representative figure of pop music, who is sometimes referred to as the \"King of Pop\".\n\nThe topic of community in Figure 5 (c) is related to electronic music, as \"kraftwerk\" and \"pet shop boys\" are both successful music groups of electronic music genre, and \"drill n bass\" and \"cyber metal\" are both related styles and subgenres. Furthermore, \"ebm\" is short for electronic body music.\n\nIn community shown in Figure 5 (d), rock music may be a distinct topic, because \"rock psicodlico\", \"rock e rock psicodlico\" and \"rock alternative\" are all related key words. And \"creep\" is a song of the Radiohead band which is well-known for alternative rock music.\n\nIn conclusion, by using our ASCD method, the four communities shown in Figure 5 all have distinct semantic descriptions and by selecting the top key words, we can easily explain and understand its content. In other word, our method is able to obtain corresponding semantic description as soon as the partition of communities is finished.\n\n\nC. Real Social Network Evaluation\n\nWe evaluated our ASCD method on 8 real social network data sets with content and ground-truth labels of communities. The details for these 8 data sets [16] [17] are shown in  (Evaluation on 8 data sets with AC and NMI as metric methods. For each data set, the best performance value is in bold, while the second-best is underlined.\n\nIn majority of cases, our method is either the best or second-best.)\n\nTo have a relatively comprehensive comparison, we selected 4 comparative methods, in which DCSBM [5] only depends on topology and BLOCK-LDA [18], PC-LDC [19] as well as SCI [8] are all existing methods that integrate topology and content. In the experiment, we only considered the case of disjoint community detection, and we set the number of communities according to the ground-truth for all the methods. Then we used NMI [15] and AC [15] to evaluate each method by comparing the community partition with corresponding ground-truth. For all methods compared, we used their default parameter setting. And for our ASCD method we adjusted \u03b4 and \u03bb during the process of evaluation, in which we used the parameter setting that minimize the objective function in (13) as the best result. Eventually, we obtained the evaluation result shown in TABLE III where the best metrics value is in bold and the second-best is underlined.\n\nAs shown in TABLE III, for the metrics of AC, our ASCD method is either the best or second-best on 6 of the 8 data sets. Moreover, for the metric of MNI, our method performs the best on 7 of the 8 data set, and is second-best for the remaining Twitter data set. In summary, in the application to real social networks, because of integrating the topological and content information, our ASCD method has resulted in better performance than methods using only topological information. By adding the adaptive parameter to resist mismatch, our new method has performed better than most of the state-of-the-art methods which integrate the topology and content information.\n\nFurthermore, as the value of objective function (13) may converge to local minima, to have a relatively favorable result, we suggest to initialize X and Y (use (6) and (8)) at least 10 times and use the initialization setting with minimum value of objective function ( (1) and (3)). Besides, \u03b4 and \u03bb are hyperparameters of our ASCD model, so the setting of them may also influence the results. According to the experiments, we suggest to set the value of \u03b4 in the interval of [0.1, 100], and the value of \u03bb in the interval of [0.01, 0). Also of note is that, when \u03bb=0 the sparsity item in (13) may not take effect.\n\n\nV. CONCLUSIONS\n\nIn this paper, we proposed a novel semantic community detection model under the framework of NMF, and derived effective updating rules whose convergence can be ensured. As we integrate the network's topological structure and content information while taking the mismatch between them into account, compared to conventional methods that only depend on topology, our method can further improve the community partition even when the mismatch is considerable. When comparing to other state-of-the-art methods which combine topology with content, our method also achieves a better performance in general because of the introduction of a novel adaptive penalty parameter to effectively control the contribution of content. More importantly, the new proposed method can also simultaneously obtain the community partitions and corresponding semantic description.\n\nHowever, the network's content information may have various forms, and the node attributes that we considered in this paper are only one of the possibilities. In fact, attributes related to edges are another common form of content information. For example, in an e-mail system, when a user establishes contact with other users by sending messages to them, the content information will be related to respective edges of the network. In addition, community detection based on edge information can also help obtain overlapping community partition, which is also a challenging problem. Therefore, to expand the application range of our ASCD method, community detection based on edge linkage and edge attributes will be our next research focus.\n\nFig. 1 .\n1Modularity convergence curves of uniform model\n\nFig. 2 .\n2Function curve of f(X,Y), with \u03b4=1 and d(X,Y) as the independent variable. Because f(X,Y) is a monotonically decreasing function, as the mismatch degree d(X,Y) increases, the adaptive parameter f(X,Y) will decrease, which means that the content will have a smaller contribution in the uniform model, and vice versa.\n\nFig. 3 .\n3The convergence curves of the value of (a) adaptive parameter f and (b) objective function\n\n\nDetection) Input: N, M, K, A, C //N is the number of nodes; M is the number of attributes; //K is the number of communities; //A is the adjacency matrix; C is the network attribute matrix; Output: X, Y //X is the community membership matrix; //Y is the community attribute matrix; Randomly set the value of X and Y while not converge //Initialize X Update X according to (6) end while while not converge //Initialize Y Update Y according to (8) end while while not converge //Update the value of X and Y\n\nFig. 5 .\n5Four examples of semantic description of top-10 attributes for different communities with the parameter setting of \u03b4=0.1 and \u03bb=0.01 according to our ASCD method. Four communities are respectively with the topic of (a) \"metal music\", (b) \"pop music\", (c) \"electronic music\" and (d) \"rock music\".\n\n\nHere we use a simplified notation [.] + to represent all the terms with positive coefficient, and use [.] to represent those with negative coefficient.
