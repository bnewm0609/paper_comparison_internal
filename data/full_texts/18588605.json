ChuiFrameSignal reconstructionPhaseSpeech recognition\nWe will construct new classes of Parseval frames for a Hilbert space which allow signal reconstruction from the absolute value of the frame coefficients. As a consequence, signal reconstruction can be done without using phase or its estimation. This verifies a longstanding conjecture of the speech processing community.\n\nIntroduction\n\nReconstruction of a signal using noisy phase or its estimation can be a critical problem in speech recognition technology. But, for many years, engineers have believed that speech recognition should be independent of phase. By constructing new classes of Parseval frames for a Hilbert space, we will show that this allows reconstruction of a signal without using noisy phase or its estimation. This verifies the longstanding conjecture of the speech processing community.\n\nFrames are redundant systems of vectors in a Hilbert spaces. They satisfy the well-known property of perfect reconstruction, in that any vector of the Hilbert space can be synthesized back from its inner products with the frame vectors. More precisely, the linear transformation from the initial Hilbert space to the space of coefficients obtained by taking the inner product of a vector with the frame vectors is injective and hence admits a left inverse. This property has been successfully used in a broad spectrum of applications, including Internet coding, multiple antenna coding, optics, quantum information theory, signal/image processing, and much more. The purpose of this paper is to study what kind of reconstruction is possible if we only have knowledge of the absolute values of the frame coefficients.\n\nIn this paper we consider only finite-dimensional frames the reason being their direct link to practical applications. Since the same question can be raised for infinite-dimensional frames, we state the problem in the setting of abstract frames.\n\nConsider a Hilbert space H with scalar product , . A finite or countable set of vectors F = {f i ; i \u2208 I} of H is called a frame if there are two positive constants A, B > 0 such that for every vector x \u2208 H ,\nA x 2 i\u2208I x, f i 2 B x 2 .\n(1.1)\n\nThe frame is tight when the constants can be chosen equal to one another, A = B. For A = B = 1, F is called a Parseval frame. The numbers x, f i are called frame coefficients.\n\nTo a frame F we associate the analysis and synthesis operators defined by For more information on frames we refer the reader to [6]. Consider now the nonlinear mapping \nM a : H \u2192 l 2 (I), M a (x) = x, f iM : H r \u2192 l 2 (I), M(x) = x, f i i\u2208I , x \u2208x. (1.6)\nThe problem we study in this paper is the injectivity of the map M. When it is injective, M admits a left inverse, meaning that any vector (signal) in H can be reconstructed up to a constant phase factor from the modulus of its frame coefficients.\n\nThe motivation for this problem comes from two applications in signal processing, one concerning noise reduction, and the other regarding speech recognition. There is also a connection with a problem in optics that we describe later.\n\nThe traditional method of signal enhancement consists of three steps: first, the input signal is linearly transformed from its input domain (e.g., time, or space) into a transformed domain (e.g., time-frequency, time-scale, space-scale, etc.); second, a (nonlinear) estimation operator is applied in this representation domain; third, a (left) inverse of the linear transformation at step one is applied to the signal obtained at step two in order to synthesize the estimated signal in the input domain. Several linear transformations have been proposed in the literature and are used in practice, e.g., windowed Fourier transform, wavelet filterbanks, local cosine basis, etc. (see [9,18]). Likewise, many signal estimators have been proposed and studied in the literature, some of them statistically motivated, e.g., Wiener (MMSE) filter, maximum a posteriori (MAP), maximum likelihood (ML), etc., others having a rather ad hoc motivation, e.g., spectral subtraction, psychoacoustically motivated audio and video estimators, etc. For more details see [1,8,17] and many other books on this topic. By way of an example let us consider the Ephraim-Malah noise reduction method [7] of speech signals. Let {x(t), t = 1, 2, . . . , T } be the samples of a speech signal. These samples are first transformed into the time-frequency domain through the fast Fourier transform,\nX(k, \u03c9) = M\u22121 t=0 g(t)x(t + kN)e \u22122\u03c0i\u03c9 t M , k = 0, 1, . . . , T \u2212 M N , (1.7) \u03c9 \u2208 {0, 1, . . . , M \u2212 1},\nwhere g is the analysis window, and M, N are respectively the window size, and the time step. Next a complicated nonlinear transformation is applied to |X(k, \u03c9)| to produce the MMSE estimate of the short-time spectral amplitude\nY (k, \u03c9) = \u221a \u03c0 2 \u221a v(k, \u03c9) \u03b3 (k, \u03c9) exp \u2212 v(k, \u03c9) 2 1 + v(k, \u03c9) I 0 v(k, \u03c9) 2 + v(k, \u03c9)I 1 v(k, \u03c9) 2 X(k, \u03c9) ,(1.8)\nwhere I 0 , I 1 are modified Bessel functions of zero and first order, and v(k, \u03c9), \u03b3 (k, \u03c9) are estimates of certain signal-to-noise ratios. The speech signal windowed Fourier coefficients are estimated simply b\u0177\nX(k, \u03c9) = Y (k, \u03c9) X(k, \u03c9) |X(k, \u03c9)| (1.9)\nand then are transformed back into time domain through an overlap-add procedur\u00ea\nx(t) = k M\u22121 \u03c9=0X (k, \u03c9)e 2\u03c0i\u03c9 t\u2212kN M h(t \u2212 kN), (1.10)\nwhere h is the synthesis window. This example illustrates a feature that is common to most signal enhancement algorithms: the nonlinear estimation in the representation domain modifies only the amplitude of the transformed signal, and keeps its noisy phase. In some applications, such as speech recognition, reconstruction with noisy phase is a critical problem. The optimal solution to this problem would occur if we do not need the phase at all to perform reconstruction into the input domain. This paper addresses exactly this issue.\n\nConsider now the problem of automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems. Given a voice signal {x(t), t = 1, 2, . . . , T }, the ASR outputs a sequence of recognized phonemes from an alphabet. Most ASR systems use different kinds of cepstral coefficient statistics (see [5,15]) as described next. The voice signal is transformed into the time-frequency domain by the same discrete windowed Fourier transform (1.7). The (real) cepstral coefficients C x (k, \u03c9) are defined as the logarithm of the modulus of X(k, \u03c9):\nC x (k, \u03c9) = log X(k, \u03c9) .\n(1.11)\n\nThere are two rationales for using this object. First note the recorded signal x(t) is a convolution of the voice signal s(t) with the source-to-microphone (channel) impulse response h. In the time-frequency domain, convolution becomes (almost) multiplication, and the cepstral coefficients decouple,\nC x (k, \u03c9) = log H (\u03c9) + C s (k, \u03c9),(1.12)\nwhere H (\u03c9) is the channel transfer function, and C s is the voice signal cepstral coefficient. Since the channel transfer function is time-invariant, by subtracting the time average we obtain\nF x (k, \u03c9) = C x (k, \u03c9) \u2212 E C x (\u00b7, \u03c9) = C s (k, \u03c9) \u2212 E C s (\u00b7, \u03c9) , (1.13)\nwhere E is the time average operator. Thus F x encodes information about the speech signal alone, independent of the reverberant environment. The second reason for using C x , and thus F x , is the widespread belief in the speech processing community that phase does not matter in speech recognition. Hence, by taking the modulus in (1.11) one does not lose information about the message (nor the messenger, as in some speaker identification algorithms).\n\nReturning to the ASR system, the corrected cepstral coefficients F x are fed into several hidden Markov models (HMMs), one HMM for each phoneme. The outputs of these HMMs give the utterance likelihood of a particular phoneme. The ASR system then chooses the phoneme with the largest likelihood.\n\nIn the two classes of signal processing algorithms described above the transformed domain signal either has a secondary role, or has none whatsoever. This observation led us to consider the information loss introduced by taking the modulus of a redundant representation. Clearly a constant phase is always lost, however is this the only loss of information with respect to the original signal? This is the problem we analyze in this paper.\n\nThere is also a closely connected problem in optics with applications to X-ray, crystallography, electron microscopy, and coherence theory see [4,10,11,14]. This problem is to reconstruct a discrete signal from the modulus of its Fourier transform under constraints in both the original and the Fourier domain. For finite signals the approach uses the Fourier transform with redundancy 2. All signals with the same modulus of the Fourier transform satisfy a polynomial factorization equation. In dimension one this factorization has an exponential number of possible solutions. In higher dimensions the factorization is shown to have generically a unique solution (see [13]).\n\nThe organization of the paper is as follows. Section 2 presents the analysis of real frames; Section 3 analyzes the case of complex frames. \n\n\nAnalysis of M for real frames\nT : R N \u2192 R M , T(x)= M k=1 x, f k e k ,(2.1)\nwhere {e 1 , . . . , e M } is the canonical basis of R M . We let W denote the range of the analysis map T (R N ).\n\nIt is an N -dimensional linear subspace of R M and thus corresponds to a point of the Grassman manifold\nGr(N, M). Two frames {f i } i\u2208I and {g i } i\u2208I are equivalent if there is an invertible operator T on H with T (f i ) = g i , for all i \u2208 I .\nIt is known that two frames are equivalent if and only if their associated analysis operators have the same range (see [2,12]). We deduce that M-element frames on R N are parametrized by the fiber bundle F (N, M; R).\n\nRecall the nonlinear map we are interested in is\nM F : R N /{\u00b11} \u2192 R M , M F (x) = M k=1 x, f k e k , x \u2208x. (2.2)\nWhen there is no danger of confusion, we shall drop F from the notation. First we reduce our analysis to equivalent classes of frames: If {f i } i\u2208I is a frame with frame operator S then {S \u22121/2 f i } i\u2208I is a Parseval frame which is equivalent to {f i } i\u2208I and called the canonical Parseval frame associated to {f i } i\u2208I . Also, {S \u22121 f i } i\u2208I is a frame equivalent to {f i } i\u2208I and is called the canonical dual frame associated to {f i } i\u2208I . Proposition 2.1 shows that when the nonlinear map M F is injective then the same property holds for the canonical dual frame and the canonical Parseval frame.\n\nGiven   (N, M). In particular the probability that a randomly chosen W will satisfy this condition is 0.\n) i = 0 if i \u2208 \u03c6, and (P \u03c6 (u)) i = u i if i \u2208 \u03c6 . For every vector u \u2208 R M , \u03c3 \u03c6 (u) = u iff u \u2208 L \u03c6 . Likewise \u03c3 \u03c6 (u) = \u2212u iff u \u2208 L \u03c6 . Note P \u03c6 (u) = 1 2 u + \u03c3 \u03c6 (u) , P \u03c6 (u) = 1 2 u \u2212 \u03c3 \u03c6 (u) .\nTo finish the proof of the theorem we need the following lemma.\nLemma 2.3. If M 2N \u2212 1 then the following holds for a generic N -dimensional subspace W \u2282 R M . Given u \u2208 W , then \u03c3 \u03c6 (u) \u2208 W iff \u03c3 \u03c6 (u) = \u00b1u.\nProof of the lemma. Suppose u \u2208 W and \u03c3 \u03c6 (u) = \u00b1u but \u03c3 \u03c6 (u) \u2208 W . Since \u03c3 \u03c6 is an involution, u + \u03c3 \u03c6 (u) is fixed by \u03c3 \u03c6 and is nonzero. Thus W \u2229 L \u03c6 = 0. Likewise\n0 = u \u2212 \u03c3 \u03c6 (u) = u + \u03c3 \u03c6 (u).\nHence W \u2229 L \u03c6 = 0. Now L \u03c6 and L \u03c6 c are fixed linear subspaces of dimension M \u2212 |\u03c6| and |\u03c6|. If M 2N \u2212 1 then one of these subspaces has codimension greater than or equal to N . However a generic linear subspace W of dimension N has 0 intersection with a fixed linear subspace of codimension greater than or equal to N . Therefore, if W is generic and x, \u03c3 \u03c6 (x) \u2208 W then \u03c3 \u03c6 (x) = \u00b1x which ends the proof of lemma. 2\n\nThe proof of the theorem now follows from the fact that if W is in the intersection of generic conditions imposed by the proposition for each subset \u03c6 \u2282 {1, . . . , M} then W satisfies the conclusion of the theorem. 2\n\nNote what the above proof actually shows:\n\n\nCorollary 2.4. The map M is injective if and only if whenever there is a nonzero element\nu \u2208 W \u2282 R M with u \u2208 L \u03c6 , then W \u2229 L \u03c6 = {0}.\nNext we observe that this result is best possible. \n\u2208 span{e i } k i=1 so that u \u22a5 W \u22a5 , hence u \u2208 W . Similarly, there is a nonzero vector v in span {e i } M i=k+1 with v \u22a5 W \u22a5 , that is v \u2208 W . By the above corollary, M cannot be injective. In fact M(u + v) = M(u \u2212 v). 2\nThe next result gives an easy way for frames to satisfy the condition above. (2) If M 2N , this condition is no longer necessary.\n\n\nProof.\n\n(1) For the first part we will prove the contrapositive. Let M = 2N \u2212 1 and assume there is an N -element subset (f i ) i\u2208\u03c6 of F which is not linearly independent. Then there is a nonzero Remark. The frames above can easily be constructed \"by hand.\" Start with an orthonormal basis for R N , say (f i ) N i=1 . Assume we have constructed sets of vectors (f i ) M i=1 such that every subset of N vectors is linearly independent. Look at the span of all of the (N \u2212 1)-element subsets of (f i ) M i=1 . Pick f M+1 not in the span of any of these subsets. Then (f i ) M+1 i=1 has the property that every N -element subset is linearly independent. Now we will give a slightly different proof of this result which gives necessary and sufficient conditions for a frame to have the required properties. Consider now the set B of frames F so that its similar frame G constructed above has a vector g k with all entries nonzero,\nx \u2208 (span(f i ) i\u2208\u03c6 ) \u22a5 \u2282 R N . Hence, 0 = u = T (x) \u2208 L \u03c6 \u2229 W . On the other hand, since dim(span(f i ) i\u2208\u03c6 ) N \u2212 1, there is a nonzero y \u2208 (span(f i ) i\u2208\u03c6 ) \u22a5 \u2282 R N so that 0 = v = T (y) \u2208 L \u03c6 \u2229 W . Now,B = F \u2208 F[N, M; R] | F \u223c G = {g k }, {d 1 , . . . , d N } \u2282 G, N j =1 g k 0 , d j = 0 for some k 0 .\nClearly B is open dense in F[N, M; R]. Thus generically F \u2208 B. Let G be its similar frame satisfying the condition above. We want to prove the set X = X F of vectors x \u2208 R N so that (M G ) \u22121 (M G a (x)) has more than one point is thin, i.e., it is included in a set whose complement is open and dense in R N . We claim 2,...,N } are linear subspaces of R N of codimension 1 indexed by subsets \u03c6 of {1, 2, . . . , N}. This claim will conclude the proof of theorem.\nX \u2282 \u03c6 (V + \u03c6 \u222a V \u2212 \u03c6 ), where (V \u00b1 \u03c6 ) \u03c6\u2282{1,\nTo verify the claim, let x, y \u2208 R N be so that M G a (x) = M G a (y) and yet x = y, nor x = \u2212y. Since G contains the canonical basis of R N , |x k | = |y k | for all 1 k N . Then there is a subset \u03c6 \u2282 {1, 2, . . . , N} so that\ny k = (\u22121) \u03c6(k) x k . Note \u03c6 = \u2205, nor \u03c6 = {1, 2, . . . , N}. Denote by D \u03c6 the diagonal N \u00d7 N matrix (D \u03c6 ) kk = (\u22121) \u03c6(k)\n. Thus y = D \u03c6 x, and yet D \u03c6 = \u00b1I . Let g k 0 \u2208 G be so that none of its entries vanishes.\nThen | x, g k 0 | = | y, g k 0 | implies x, (I \u00b1 D \u03c6 )g k 0 = 0.\nThis proves the set X G is included in the union of 2(2 N \u2212 2) linear subspaces of codimension 1,\n\u03c6 =\u2205,\u03c6 =\u2205 (I \u2212 D \u03c6 )g k 0 \u22a5 \u222a (I + D S )g k 0 \u22a5 .\nSince F is similar to G, X F is included in the image of the above set through a linear invertible map, which proves the claim. 2\n\n\nAnalysis of M for complex frames\n\nIn this section the Hilbert space is C N . For an M-element frame F = {f 1 , . . . , f M } of C N the analysis operator is defined by (2.1), where the scalar product is x, y = N k=1 x k y k . The range of coefficients, i.e., the range of the analysis operator, is a complex N -dimensional subspace of C M that we denote again by W . Thus a frame determines a point of the complex Grassmanian Gr(N, M)  The nonlinear map we are studying is given by\nM F : C N /T 1 \u2192 C M , M F (x) = M k=1 x, f k e k , x \u2208x,(3.1)\nwhere two vectors x, y \u2208x if there is a scalar c \u2208 C with |c| = 1 so that y = cx. Proposition 2.1 holds true for complex frames as well. Thus without loss of generality we shall work with the topology induced by the base manifold of F (N, M; C) into the set of M-element frames of C N .\n\nAs in the real case we reduce the question about M-element frames in C N to a question about the Grassmanian of N -planes in C M .\n\nFirst we prove the following: and v and w are two nonparallel vectors whose entries have the same modulus. Our choice of basis for W ensures that one of the first N entries in v (and hence w) are nonzero. Since we only care about these vectors up to rescaling we may assume, after reordering, that v 1 = w 1 = 1. Also the vectors are assumed nonparallel so we may assume that v i = w i = 0 for some i N . After yet again reordering we can assume that v 2 = w 2 = 0.\n\nSet \u03bb 1 = 1. By assumption there are numbers \u03bb 2 , . . . , \u03bb M \u2208 T 1 with \u03bb 2 = 1 such that w i = \u03bb i v i for i = 1, . . . , M. Expanding in terms of the basis for W we have for i > N, v i = N j =1 v j u i,j and w i = N j =1 \u03bb j v j u i,j . Thus if W satisfies ( * ) there must be \u03bb 2 , . . . , \u03bb N \u2208 T 1 (with \u03bb 2 = 1) and v 2 , . . . , v N \u2208 C such that for all N\n+ 1 i M we have N j =1 v j u i,j = N j =1 \u03bb j v j u i,j . (3.2)\nConsider the variety Y of all tuples\n(W, v 2 , . . . , v N , \u03bb 2 , . . . , \u03bb N )\nas above.\n\nSince v 2 = 0 and \u03bb 2 = 1 this variety is locally isomorphic to the real (2N  The main result in the complex case then follows from Theorem 3.1.   \n(M \u2212 N) + 3N \u2212 3)- dimensional variety C N(M\u2212N) \u00d7 C {0} \u00d7 (C) N \u22122 \u00d7 T 1 {1} \u00d7 T 1 N \u22122 .v = (v 1 , . . . , v N ) such that (M F ) \u22121 (M F a (v)\n) has more than one point is thin in C N , i.e., its complement has dense interior. 2\n\nWe do not know the precise optimal bound for the complex case but we believe it is 4N \u2212 2. However, this case is different from the real case in that complex frames with only 2N \u2212 1 elements cannot have M F injective. To see this we observe that the proof of Theorem 2.8 (1) \u21d2 (2) does not use the fact that the frames are real. So in the complex case we have:  Now, z, w \u2208 W and z(N) = 1 and w(N) = i. Hence, |z + w| = |z \u2212 w|. It follows that there is a complex number |c| = 1 so that z + w = c(z \u2212 w). Since z i = 0 for some i < N we have that c = 1 and w = 0 which is a contradiction. 2\n\n\nImplementation of these results\n\nFor these results to be widely applied they need to run on existing software with only trivial modifications. So there are two critical issues that need to be addressed for implementation of signal reconstruction without phase. (1) Find Gabor frames which work in this setting-so we can use the fast Fourier transform for digitalizing the signal. (2) Find efficient reconstruction algorithms-preferably algorithms which are close to the inverse fast Fourier transform. These two problems are the focus of current research on this topic [3]. It appears at this time that small frames near the threshold of our results ((2N \u2212 1) elements in the real case and (4N \u2212 2) elements in the complex case) may require exponential time for reconstruction. However, it is shown in [3] that generic frames with N 2 -elements give polynomial time reconstruction (on the order of at most N 6 calculations). In [3] there are some special classes of frames with N 2 elements which have extremely efficient algorithms for reconstruction in N calculations (2N in the complex case).\n\nT\n: H \u2192 l 2 (I),T (x) = x, f i i\u2208I , (1.2) T * : l 2 (I) \u2192 H, T * (c) = i\u2208I c i f i ,(1.3) which are well defined due to (1.1), and are adjoint to one another. The range of T in l 2 (I) is called the range of coefficients. The frame operator defined by S = T * T : H \u2192 H is invertible by (1.1) and provides the perfect reconstruction formula: x = i\u2208I x, f i S \u22121 f i . (1.4)\n\n\nConsider the case H = R N , and the index set I has cardinality M, I = {1, 2, . . . , M}. Then l 2 (I) R M . The set Gr(N, M; R) of N -dimensional linear subspaces of R M has the structure of an N(M \u2212 N)dimensional manifold called the Grassman manifold [19, p. 129]. The frame bundle F (N, M; R) is the GL(N, R)-bundle over Gr(N, M) defined as follows: the fiber of F (N, M; R) over a point of GL(N, R) corresponding to an N -dimensional linear subspace W \u2282 R M is the set of all possible bases for W . For a frame F = {f 1 , . . . , f M } of R N we denote by T the analysis operator,\n\nProposition 2. 1 .\n1For any two frames F and G that have the same range of coefficients, M F is injective if and only if M G is injective. Proof. Any two frames F = {f k } and G = {g k } that have the same range of coefficients are equivalent, i.e., there is an invertible R : R N \u2192 R N so that g k = Rf k , 1 k M. Their associated nonlinear maps M F , and respectively M G , satisfy M G (x) = M F (R * x). This shows that M F is injective if and only if M G is injective. Consequently the property of injectivity of M depends only on the subspace of coefficients W in Gr(N, M). 2 This result says that for two frames corresponding to two points in the same fiber of F (N, M; R), the injectivity of their associated nonlinear maps would jointly hold true or fail. Because of this result we shall always assume the induced topology by the base manifold Gr(N, M) of the fiber bundle F (N, M; R) into the set of M-element frames of R N .\n\n\n\u03c6 \u2282 {1, . . . , M}, let \u03c6(i) denote the characteristic function of \u03c6 defined by the rule that \u03c6(i) = 1 if i \u2208 \u03c6 and \u03c6(i) = 0 if i / \u2208 \u03c6. Define a map \u03c3 \u03c6 : R M \u2192 R M by the formula \u03c3 \u03c6 (a 1 , . . . , a M ) = (\u22121) \u03c6(1) a 1 , . . . , (\u22121) \u03c6(M) a M .Clearly \u03c3 2 \u03c6 = id and \u03c3 \u03c6 = \u2212\u03c3 \u03c6 , where \u03c6 is the complement of \u03c6. Let L \u03c6 denote the |\u03c6|-dimensional linear subspace of R M where L \u03c6 = {(a 1 , . . . , a M ) | a i = 0, i \u2208 \u03c6}, and let P \u03c6 : R M \u2192 L \u03c6 denote the orthogonal projection onto this subspace. Thus (P \u03c6(u)\n\nTheorem 2. 2 (\n2Real frames). If M 2N \u2212 1 then for a generic frame F , M is injective. By generic we mean an open dense subset of the set of all M-element frames in R N . Proof. Suppose that x and x have the same image under M = M F . Let a 1 , . . . , a M be the frame coefficients of x and a 1 , . . . , a M the frame coefficients for x . Then a i = \u00b1a i for each i. In particular there is a subset \u03c6 \u2282 {1, . . . , M} of indices such that a i = (\u22121) \u03c6(i) a i . Then two vectors x, x have the same image under M if and only there is a subset \u03c6 \u2282 {1, . . . , M} such that (a 1 , . . . , a M ) and ((\u22121) \u03c6(1) a 1 , . . . , (\u22121) \u03c6(M) a M ) are both in W the range of coefficients associated to F .To finish the proof we will show that when M 2N \u2212 1 such a condition is impossible for a generic subspace W \u2282 R N . This means that the set of such W 's is a dense (Zariski) open set in the Grassmanian Gr\n\nProposition 2. 5 .\n5If M 2N \u2212 2, then the result fails for all M-element frames. Proof. Since M 2N \u2212 2, we have that 2M \u2212 2N + 2 M. Let (e i ) M i=1 be the canonical orthonormal basis of R M . We can write (e i ) M i=1 = (e i ) k i=1 \u222a (e i ) M i=k+1 , where both k and M \u2212 k are M \u2212 N + 1. Let W be any N -dimensional subspace of R M . Since dim W \u22a5 = M \u2212 N , there exists a nonzero vector u\n\nCorollary 2. 6 .\n6If F is an M-element frame for R N with M 2N \u2212 1 having the property that every N -element subset of the frame is linearly independent, then M is injective. Proof. Given the conditions, it follows that W has no elements which are zero in N coordinates and so the corollary holds. 2 Corollary 2.7. (1) If M = 2N \u2212 1, then the condition given in Corollary 2.6 is also necessary.\n\n\nby Corollary 2.4, M is not injective. (2) If M 2N we construct an M-element frame for R N that has an N -element linearly dependent subset. Let F = {f 1 , . . . , f 2N \u22121 } be a frame for R N so that any N -element subset is linearly independent. By Corollary 2.4, the map M F is injective. Now extend this frame to F = {f 1 , . . . , f M } by f 2N = \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 = f M = f 2N \u22121 . The map M F extends M F and therefore remains injective, whereas clearly any N -element subset that contains two vectors from {f 2N \u22121 , f 2N , . . . , f M } is no longer linearly independent. 2\n\nTheorem 2. 8 .\n8Let (f i ) M i=1 be a frame for R N . The following are equivalent: (1) The map M is injective. (2) For every subset \u03c6 \u2282 {1, 2, . . . , M}, either {fi } i\u2208\u03c6 spans R N or {f i } i\u2208\u03c6 c spans R N .Proof. (1) \u21d2 (2) We prove the contrapositive. So assume that there is a subset \u03c6 \u2282 {1, 2, . . . , M} so that neither {f i ; i \u2208 \u03c6} nor {f i ; i \u2208 {\u03c6 } spans R N . Hence there are nonzero vectors x, y \u2208 R N so thatx \u22a5 span(f i ) i\u2208\u03c6 and y \u22a5 span(f i ) i\u2208\u03c6 . Then 0 = T (x) \u2208 L S \u2229 W and 0 = T (y) \u2208 L \u03c6 \u2229 W . Now by Corollary 2.4 we have that M cannot be injective.(2) \u21d2 (1) Suppose M(x) = M(\u0177) for somex,\u0177 \u2208 R N /{\u00b11}. This means that for every 1 j M, | x, f j | = | y, f j |, where x \u2208x and y \u2208\u0177. Let \u03c6 = j : x, f j = \u2212 y, f j . (2.3) Note \u03c6 = j : x, f j = y, f j . (2.4) Now, x + y \u22a5 span(f i ) i\u2208\u03c6 and x \u2212 y \u22a5 span(f i ) i\u2208\u03c6 . Assume that {f i ; i \u2208\u03c6} spans R N . Then x + y = 0 and thusx =\u0177. If {f i ; i \u2208 \u03c6 } spans R N then x \u2212 y = 0 and againx =\u0177. Either wayx =\u0177 which proves M is injective. 2 For M < 2N \u2212 1 there are plenty of frames for which M is not injective. However, for a generic frame, we can show the set of rays that can be reconstructed from the image under M is open dense in R N /{\u00b11}. Theorem 2.9. Assume M > N. Then for a generic frame F \u2208 F[N, M; R], the set of vectors x \u2208 R N so that (M F ) \u22121 (M F a (x)) consists of one point in R N /{\u00b11} has dense interior in R N . Proof. Let F be a M-element frame in R N . Then F is similar to a frame G which consists of the union of the canonical basis of R N , {d 1 , . . . , d N }, with some other set of M \u2212 N vectors. Let G = {g k ; 1 k M}. Thus g k j = d j , 1 j N , for some N elements {k 1 , k 2 , . . . , k N } of {1, 2, . . . , M}.\n\n\nC parametrizing N -dimensional complex subspaces of C N . As in the real case, the set of M-frames of C N is parametrized by points of the fiber bundle F (N, M; C), the GL(N, C)-bundle over Gr(N, M) C .\n\nTheorem 3. 1 .\n1If M 4N \u22122 then the generic N -plane W in C M has the property that if v = (v 1 , . . . , v M ) and w = (w 1 , . . . , w M ) are vectors in W such that |v i | = |w i | for all i, then v = \u03bbw for some complex number \u03bb of modulus 1.Proof. We will say that an N -plane W has property ( * ) if there are nonparallel vectors v, w in W such that |v i | = |w i | for all i. Recall two vectors x, y are parallel if there is a scalar c \u2208 C so that y = cx.Given an N -plane W , we may assume, after reordering the coordinates on C M , that W is the span of the rows of an N \u00d7 M matrix of the form\u23a1 \u23a2 \u23a2 \u23a3 1 0 . . . 0 u N +1,1 . . . u M,1 0 1 . . . 0 u N +1,2 . . . u M,2 . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 0 0 . . . 1 u N +1,N . . . u M,N \u23a4 \u23a5 \u23a5 \u23a6 , where the N(M \u2212 N) entries {u i,j } are viewed as indeterminates. Thus Gr(N, M) C is isomorphic to C N(M\u2212N) in a neighborhood of W . Now suppose that W satisfies ( * )\n\n\nThe locus in Gr(N, M) C of planes satisfying property ( * ) is denoted by X. This variety is the image under projection to the first factor of Y cut out by the M \u2212 N equations (3.2) for N + 1 i M. The analysis of these equations is summarized by the following result.\n\nLemma 3. 2 .\n2The M \u2212 N equations in (3.2) are independent. Hence X is a variety of real dimension at most 2N(M \u2212 N) + 3N \u2212 3 \u2212 (M \u2212 N). Proof of Lemma 3.2. For any choice of 0 = v 2 , v 3 , . . . , v N and 1 = \u03bb 2 , \u03bb 3 , . . . , \u03bb N the equation . Since the variables u i,1 , . . . , u i,N appear in exactly one equation, these equations (for fixed v 2 , v 3 , . . . , v N , \u03bb 2 , . . . , \u03bb N ) define a subspace of C N(M\u2212N) of real codimension at least M \u2212 N . Since this is true for all choices, it follows that the equations are independent. 2 From this lemma it follows that the locus of N -planes satisfying ( * ) has (local) real dimension 2N(M \u2212 N) + 3N \u2212 3 \u2212 (M \u2212 N). Therefore if 3N \u2212 3 \u2212 (M \u2212 N) < 0, i.e., if M 4N \u2212 2, this locus cannot be all of Gr(N, M) C . This ends the proof of Theorem 3.1. 2\n\nTheorem 3. 3 (\n3Complex frames). If M 4N \u2212 2 then M F is injective for a generic frame F = {f 1 , . . . , f N }.\n\nTheorem 3. 4 .\n4If M 2N then for a generic frame F \u2208 F[N, M; C] the set of vectors x \u2208 C N such that (M F ) \u22121 (M F a (x)) has one point in C N /T 1 has dense interior in C N . Proof. By Lemma 3.2, for a generic frame the M \u2212 N equations (3.2) in 2(N \u2212 1) indeterminates (v 2 , . . . , v N , \u03bb 2 , . . . , \u03bb N ) are independent. Note there are 3(N \u2212 1) real valued unknowns and M \u2212 N equations. Hence the set of {(v 2 , . . . , v N )} in C N \u22121 for which there are (\u03bb 2 , . . . , \u03bb N ) such that (3.2) has solution in (C {0}) \u00d7 (C) N \u22122 \u00d7 (T 1 {1}) \u00d7 (T 1 ) N \u22122 has real dimension at most 3(N \u2212 1) \u2212 (M \u2212 N) = 4N \u2212 3 \u2212 M. For M 2N it follows 3(N \u2212 1) \u2212 (M \u2212 N) < 2(N \u2212 1) which shows the set of\n\nProposition 3. 5 .\n5If {f j } j \u2208I is a complex frame and M F is injective, then for every \u03c6 \u2282 {1, 2, . . . , M} if L \u03c6 \u2229 W = {0} then L \u03c6 c \u2229 W = {0}. Hence, for every such \u03c6, either {f j } j \u2208\u03c6 or {f j } j \u2208\u03c6 c spans H .Now we can show that complex frames must contain at least 2N elements for M F to be injective.\n\nProposition 3. 6 (\n6Complex frames). If M F is injective then M 2N . Proof. We assume that M = 2N \u2212 1 and show that in this case M F is not injective. Let {z j } N j =1 be a basis for W and let P be the orthogonal projection onto the first N \u2212 1 unit vectors in C M . Then {P z j } N j =1 sits in an (N \u2212 1)-dimensional space and so there are complex scalars {a j } N \u22121 j =1 , not all zeros, so that a j P z j = 0. That is, there is a vector 0 = y \u2208 W with support y \u2282 {N, N + 1, . . . , 2N \u2212 1}. Similarly, there is a vector 0 = x \u2208 W with support x \u2282 {1, 2, . . . , N}. If x(N) = 0 or y(N) = 0 we contradict Proposition 3.4. Also, if x(i) = 0 for all i < N, then (y \u2212 cx)(N ) = 0 for c = y(N) x(N) |x(N)| 2 . Now, x, y \u2212 cx are in W and have disjoint support so our map is not injective. Otherwise, let z = x(N) |x(N)| 2 , w= i y(N) |y(N)| 2 .\n\n\nobtained by taking the absolute value entrywise of the analysis operator. Let us denote by H r the quotient space H r = H/ \u223c obtained by identifying two vectors that differ by a constant phase factor: x \u223c y if there is a scalar c with |c| = 1 so that y = cx. For real Hilbert spaces c can only be +1 or \u22121, and thus H r = H/{\u00b11}. For complex Hilbert spaces c can be any complex number of modulus one, c = e i\u03d5 , and then H r = H/T 1 , where T 1 is the complex unit circle. In quantum mechanics these projective rays define quantum states (see[16]). Clearly two vectors of H in the same ray would have the same image through M a . Thus the nonlinear mapping M a extends to H r asi\u2208I \n(1.5) \n\n\n\n. B D O Anderson, J B Moore, Optimal Filtering. Prentice HallB.D.O. Anderson, J.B.
