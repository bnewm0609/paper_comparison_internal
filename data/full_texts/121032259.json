Two types of neural networks\u2014the self-organizing maps (SOMs) and the forward-feeding back-propagating neural networks (FBNNs)\u2014were employed. This methodology is demonstrated to be a robust alternative to using GCM output directly for tropical cyclone projections, which generally require high-resolution simulations. By attributing the projected changes to the related environmental variables, Emanuel\u2019s revised genesis potential index is used to measure the GP. Changes are identified in the first (P1) and second (P2) half of the twenty-first century. The early and late summer GP decreases in both the P1 and P2 periods over most of the eastern half of the basin and increases off the East Coast of the United States and the north coast of Venezuela during P1. The peak summer GP over the region...", "fields_of_study": "[\"Environmental Science\"]", "external_ids": {"arxiv": null, "mag": "2007612631", "acl": null, "pubmed": null, "pubmedcentral": null, "dblp": null, "doi": "10.1175/jtech-d-11-00178.1"}}, "content": {"source": {"pdf_hash": "4077ba01d4618f8022804596c5e58a462a9a9cf2", "pdf_src": "MergedPDFExtraction", "pdf_uri": null, "oa_url_match": false, "oa_info": {"license": "implied-oa", "open_access_url": "https://doi.org/10.1175/jtech-d-11-00178.1", "status": "HYBRID"}}, "grobid": {"id": "c072526df088ae64e764982c74bb921bd273d63c", "type": "plain-text", "url": "s3://ai2-s2-pdf-extraction-prod/parse-results/s2orc_worker/4077ba01d4618f8022804596c5e58a462a9a9cf2.txt", "contents": "\nApplication of artificial neural networks on North Atlantic tropical cyclogenesis potential index in climate change\n\n\nZheng \nAOS\nMcGill University\n\n\nJackie Yip \nAOS\nMcGill University\n\n\nM K ( Peter \nAOS\nMcGill University\n\n\n) Yau \nAOS\nMcGill University\n\n\nApplication of artificial neural networks on North Atlantic tropical cyclogenesis potential index in climate change\n\n\n\n\u2022 Project possible changes in tropical cyclone genesis frequency in the Atlantic Basin for the period 2000 -2099. \u2022 Develop analysis method to alleviate known limitations in TC climate change projections Two common approaches:\n\na.
