INTRODUCTION\n\nThe widespread roll-out of advanced metering infrastructure (AMI) is actively replacing the outdated metering equipment with new \"smart\" hardware components. This development enables real-time information exchange between power suppliers and end-users, creating a new landscape for data-driven services, e.g., demand response and load forecasting [1]. Furthermore, the growing penetration of distributed renewable energy sources (RES), e.g., photovoltaic systems and wind turbines, along with the new trends in transportation (more Christos L. Athanasiadis is also with the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Democritus University of Thrace, 67100 Xanthi, Greece (e-mail: cathanas@ee.duth.gr).\n\nAcknowledgment: This research has been co-financed by the European Regional Development Fund of the European Union and Greek national funds through the Operational Program Competitiveness, Entrepreneurship and Innovation, under the call RESEARCH-CREATE-INNOVATE (project: T2EDK-03898). electric vehicles) and heating (new advanced heating, ventilation, and air conditioning and, course, heat pumps), make electricity demand present unprecedented diversity and complexity jeopardizing the reliable operation of power systems [2].\n\nAccurate forecasting models are required to alleviate such risks. In particular, accurate prediction of peak demand magnitude and occurring time has gathered increasing interest in the research community due to its numerous benefits to both energy providers and end-users (consumers or prosumers). On the one hand, consumers can distribute their energy needs evenly during the day or shift their peak demand to hours where lower rates apply, leading to money and energy savings. On the other hand, energy providers can properly schedule their production and the maintenance of their assets, i.e., generation units and distribution networks and grids, without falling short in the load demands of their customers. Furthermore, accurate peak demand forecasting leads to optimal utilization of the costly and non-renewable peak load power plants, avoiding grid congestion during peak hours, and ensuring the economic benefits and stability of the power grid [2].\n\nPrior work on load and peak demand forecasting can be categorized based on various criteria such as (i) the forecasting methodology or approach (e.g., regression models, deep learning, probabilistic models, genetic algorithms), (ii) the input data (e.g., time-series endogenous features, weather data, calendar data), and (iii) the forecast horizon. The forecast horizon can be classified as short-term (from several hours to one week) [3], medium-term (from week to months) [4], and longterm (more than a year ahead) [5]. A comprehensive review of peak demand forecasting methods and their categorization is presented in [2].\n\nIn the literature, short-term and medium-term forecasting have attracted attention due to their importance in power system control, unit commitment, economic dispatch, and the operation of electricity markets. Various stochastic time series models have been developed based on auto-regressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) models [6]- [8]. Furthermore, machine learning (ML) models such as long short-term memory (LSTM) networks [3], [9], multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs) [4], [10]- [12], support-vector regressors (SVRs) [13]- [15], and ensemble modeling [16]- [18] have been adopted. Methods deriving from signal processing, such as the wavelet transformation, have also been used with ML models showing enhanced performance [15].\n\nOn the other hand, the attention on long-term forecasting is lower despite its vital role in grid investments, e.g., construction of new generation facilities, development of transmission and distribution systems [5]. Most approaches in this domain utilize probabilistic forecasts. A density forecast approach with quantifiable probabilistic uncertainty is presented in [5]. Moreover, probabilistic forecasts of both magnitude and timing for lead times of one year utilizing simulated weather data are considered in [19]. In [20], the authors present a robust probability density method for yearly peak demand using a non-parametric model, and in [21], multiple regression models are leveraged.\n\nThe scope of this paper is to benchmark the performance of various ML models in short-term peak demand forecasting. Specifically, 11 ML models are implemented, including linear regression, tree-based approaches, and artificial neural networks (ANNs). The models are compared based on their accuracy using three relevant metrics and their training time in the day-ahead forecasting of the peak demand magnitude. Besides the models and the evaluation metrics, the article aims to present the feature engineering process where endogenous (related to the load time-series) and exogenous features (calendar and weather) are extracted.\n\nThe paper is structured as follows: Section II describes the dataset and preprocessing steps. In Section III, the proposed ML models are presented. In Section IV, the evaluation metrics and the experimental results regarding the accuracy of the models and the training time are analyzed. A discussion section about combining peak demand forecasting and Non-Intrusive Load Monitoring (NILM) to achieve grid flexibility management follows. Finally, Section VI concludes the paper.\n\n\nII. DATASET AND FEATURE ENGINEERING\n\nThis section presents the dataset used in the following experiments, along with the exploratory data analysis and the feature engineering process.\n\n\nA. Dataset Analysis\n\nThe dataset used in the exploratory analysis, the testing, and the evaluation of the developed models contains the aggregated load data provided for three residential areas in the Netherlands with 15-minute granularity measurements. Mainly the time series ranges from January 2019 to July 2021. Since weather information plays an essential role in the load consumption, weather data (temperature, solar irradiance, relative humidity) for the same area and period are extracted from [22]. It is vital that both historical and predicted future values of the weather data are accurate since inaccuracies could lead to the propagation of errors in the forecast peak demand values. Since the target is to forecast the day-ahead peak, the peak demand time series is created by keeping the maximum value for each day; this is plotted in Fig. 1.\n\nA yearly seasonality is apparent, with peaks being smaller during the summer months and more significant during winter. This behavior is expected since heating needs during winter at the same hour (since all installations are in the same area) could lead to increased aggregated consumption. Moreover, a smaller duration pattern that causes spikes in the time series seems to exist, probably due to the different consumption behavior during the working days and the weekend. In Fig. 2, the boxplots of peak demand values per day of the week are presented. On average, the peak during the weekend is lower, which can be justified by switching off commercial or industrial loads. Based on this information, it is essential to incorporate information about the day of the week in the forecasting models.\n\nAnother critical feature during time series analysis is autocorrelation. The autocorrelation and partial autocorrelation plots show a seven-day decaying periodical behavior. Fig. 3 and Fig. 4 provide evidence of the existence of periodicity in the daily peak demand time series. Also, the partial autocorrelation coefficients between the examined day and the previous days of the same week are high. Similarly, the autocorrelation with one and two weeks back is statistically significant. Thus, such values can be helpful for additional inputs for such a forecasting model.\n\nB. Feature Engineering 1) Endogenous features: Based on the analysis of the last subsection, past observations are the best predictors due to the high autocorrelation with the examined value. Thus, the daily peak of the previous day (P \u22121 ), the previous week (P \u22127 ), and the previous two weeks (P \u221214 ) have been selected as Another feature in this category is a 'similar day' peak value. A similar technique is applied here based on the idea proposed in [23] of finding segments of the historical data that are similar to the examined segment. For the day-ahead forecasting problem, the interest in finding a single day in the historical observations is 'similar' to the previous day. This similarity is calculated by considering a point in a M -d subspace and then calculating the euclidean distance between each day. In this work, M = 5 and the subspace features are the peak demand, maximum temperature, solar irradiance, wind speed, and season. The day closer to the previous day is considered the 'similar day', and the peak value of the day after the 'similar day' is used as an input feature to the models (P similar ).\n\n2) Exogenous features: Apart from the endogenous features, past observations of some significant weather variables such as temperature, solar irradiance and relative humidity are also used. Similarly to endogenous features, the average (T av \u22121 ), minimum (T min \u22121 ), and maximum temperature (T max \u22121 ), average irradiance (I av \u22121 ) and relative humidity (H av \u22121 ) of the previous day are employed.\n\nThe last kind of feature used in this work is calendar features that can easily be extracted from the timestamps of the measurements, i.e., month, season, and whether a particular day is on a weekend or holiday. More specifically, to capture the cyclical nature of the month, the following sine/cosine transformation is applied:\nx sin = sin 2\u03c0 \u00b7 (x \u2212 1) 12 ,(1)\nx cos = cos 2\u03c0 \u00b7 (x \u2212 1) 12 ,\n\nwhere x \u2208 [1,12] is the number of month. In Table I, the Pearson correlation coefficient of all independent variables with the target variable, i.e., the day-ahead peak magnitude, can be seen. Large values show that the features used are useful predictors, and when fed into a predictive model, they will produce accurate results.\n\n\nIII. MODELS\n\nThis section presents various ML models, including linear regression, tree-based models, and ANNs. Regarding linear regression, apart from the simple model that minimizes the residual sum of squares between the observed targets and the predictions of a linear approximation, variants such as a ridge, lasso, and elastic net are examined, which impose penalties on the coefficients of the linear model based on L 1 -norm, L 2norm, and their combination, respectively. From tree-based approaches, a simple decision tree, a random forest, and an Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) model are selected, whereas from ANN approaches, besides an MLP, and an SVR, more advanced models like one-dimensional convolutional neural networks (1D-CNN) are tested. The concept behind later models regarding time series forecasting is that the original time series is split into subsequences fed into the model instead of the extracted features. This way, the model can capture similar features across different sequences exploiting the sequential character of the data. An even more advanced approach to capture that sequential character is using recurrent neural networks (RNNs), which use internal cell states; to this end, a bidirectional LSTM is also examined.\n\nA portion of the dataset from January 2019 to May 2021 is used for training to evaluate the developed models and test their ability to predict and generalize. Then, data from June and July 2021 are used for testing. The fine-tuning of the ML models was achieved based on a grid search approach to detect the best parameters by keeping part of the training set as a validation set; the parameters with the best performance were finally selected. For the creation of the validation sets, 20% of the training set was kept as a validation set, and 4fold rolling cross-validation was applied to obtain more robust results, as illustrated in Fig. 5.\n\n\nIV. EVALUATION METRICS AND RESULTS\n\nThis section presents the evaluation metrics used for the experiments. The proposed models are compared based on their prediction accuracy and computation burden, i.e., training time.\n\n\nA. Metrics\n\nThe mean absolute percentage error (MAPE), the symmetric mean absolute percentage error (SMAPE), and the coefficient of determination (R 2 ) are calculated to compare the performance of all examined models in forecasting the peak magnitude. Considering that the actual time series of daily peak demand for N days is y and the estimated is\u0177, the metrics are calculated as:\nM AP E = 1 N N t=1 y t \u2212\u0177 t y t(3)SM AP E = 1 N N t=1 2 \u00b7 |y t \u2212\u0177 t | |y t | + |\u0177 t |(4)R 2 = 1 \u2212 N t=1 (y t \u2212\u0177 t ) 2 N t=1 (y t \u2212 y t ) 2(5)\nwhere y t is the average value of y.\n\n\nB. Results\n\nThe calculated metrics of the previous subsection for all examined models are summarized in Table II. As mentioned earlier, the test set consists of data from June-July, 2021.\n\nRegarding training time, it should be noted that all experiments were performed on a personal laptop with an Intel Core i7-8750H processor and 16 GB of RAM. Based on the previous results, the total M AP E ranges from 3.56 for the most complicated model, i.e., the bidirectional LSTM, to 5.10 for the simplest model, i.e., the linear regression. However, the training time of the former model is 602.67 sec., whereas the latter is trained in 0.11 sec. Despite the difference in computational cost during training, it should be noted that training is an offline process that needs to take place sparsely, e.g., once a week, a month, or even a few months, depending on data availability and model performance after deployment. Thus, in most cases, a training time of 10 min. is neither a significant cost nor a constraint.\n\n\nV. DISCUSSION: PEAK DEMAND FORECASTING, NON INTRUSIVE LOAD MONITORING & GRID FLEXIBILITY\n\nThe whole topic of forecasting in the energy sector has been of critical importance and has been thoroughly investigated during the last decades. Forecasting can be about various aspects, such as demand (load, power, or energy), price, availability of resources (RES or not), the energy mix, and others. That interest is to be expected since being able to forecast energy consumption accurately, production or prices impacts various stakeholders, from energy companies to grid operators and end users.\n\nLately, additional infrastructure (sensors, grid monitoring assets, and smart meters) enabled access to more types and higher data resolutions. That can unlock extra capabilities, i.e., accurately predicting the peak mentioned above demand. In parallel, recent advances in the NILM area [24]- [26], allow for the accurate -and potentially also in real-time -detection of specific energy-intensive appliances, such as electric vehicles, immersion heaters or air conditioners.\n\nCombining and relying on a blend of accurate peak demand forecasting and NILM tools can be the cornerstone of valuable grid flexibility actions and services. Real-time, or not necessarily, detection and aggregation of energy-intensive appliances or activities that are hidden behind peaks in the energy consumption time series will be the key to unlocking significant financial, environmental, and grid operation benefits.\n\n\nVI. CONCLUSION\n\nIn this work, the problem of day-ahead peak demand forecasting has been investigated. A time series of the aggregated load for three residential areas in the Netherlands from January 2019 to July 2021 was analyzed to extract valuable features that can improve forecasting accuracy. Various ML models were examined: four linear regression models, three treebased, and four ML models. The models were benchmarked based on the accuracy and training time since scalability and low computational cost is essential for real-life applications. In future steps, the examined models will be tested for multiday-ahead forecasting, and the prediction of the occurring time of the peak demand will be investigated. Moreover, the integration of the optimal peak demand forecasting approaches with the best NILM practices will also be further studied.\n\nFig. 1 .\n1Daily peak load time series\n\nFig. 2 .\n2Boxplots of peak load per weekday Fig. 3.
