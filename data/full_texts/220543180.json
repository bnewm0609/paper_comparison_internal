Good reliability and validity data were obtained for the scale. It has high internal consistency, as well as a clear factor structure. The three components of jealousy correlate with established jealousy scales. The results also show that emotional jealousy is positively related to love, while cognitive jealousy is negatively related to love. All three components are negatively related to liking. Emotional and behavioural jealousy are negatively related to happiness. Thus, both convergent and discriminant validity are established. The MJS is useful in providing a clearer picture of the relationships between the components of jealousy and various psychological variables than traditional unidimensional measures of jealousy. Practical implications of the scale in detecting pathological jealousy are discussed.", "fields_of_study": null, "external_ids": {"arxiv": null, "mag": null, "acl": null, "pubmed": null, "pubmedcentral": null, "dblp": null, "doi": "10.1177/026540758900600203"}}, "content": {"source": {"pdf_hash": "e1d2a7a32d7ae3c7284302ae18506ccb1253a4fe", "pdf_src": "Sage", "pdf_uri": null, "oa_url_match": false, "oa_info": null}, "grobid": {"id": "3f3d2d8955322f325af6db2238355fa07007ebd9", "type": "plain-text", "url": "s3://ai2-s2-pdf-extraction-prod/parse-results/s2orc_worker/e1d2a7a32d7ae3c7284302ae18506ccb1253a4fe.txt", "contents": "\n\n\n\n", "annotations": {"author": null, "publisher": null, "author_last_name": null, "author_first_name": null, "author_affiliation": null, "title": null, "venue": null, "abstract": null, "bib_ref": null, "figure": null, "paragraph": null, "formula": null, "table_ref": null, "section_header": null, "table": null, "figure_caption": null, "figure_ref": null, "bib_author_first_name": null, "bib_author_last_name": null, "bib_entry": null, "bib_title": null, "bib_author": null, "bib_venue": null}}}, "year": 2023, "month": 12, "day": 17}
