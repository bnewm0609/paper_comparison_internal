This allows to provide a general minimum basis of requirements and recommendations for measures to protect information processed in various information infrastructures.\n\nHowever, the process of assessing the effectiveness of a created or modernized security system can be improved by applying international experience in actors' tactics and techniques to expand the knowledge base of posterior analysis implemented in the information protection systems design.\n\nIt should be mentioned that information security experts do not fully monitor the ability of the security system to resist modern complex cyber-attacks, which also include targeted attacks, and do not take into account all the experience about actors' methods, their potential and techniques used, when assessing the effectiveness of the implemented information security system. According to this, the relevance of this article is obvious and the most prosperous direction of improving the protection system by applying knowledge of the actors' tactics and techniques is considered.\n\n\nII. CURRENT PROCESS DESCRIPTION\n\n\nA. Level of information details and content in knowledge bases\n\nThe most systematic sources of intruders' actions are MITRE corporation ATT&CK knowledge base [2] and Russian Threat Data Bank provided by Federal service of technical and export control (hereinafter -FSTEC TDB) [1], which will be considered as an example of information security threats classification in our work.\n\nThe information presented in the previously mentioned sources [1] and [2] and the level of its specification are similar to each other as was described in article [3], consequently, it is proposed to use the ATT&CK knowledge base together with the FSTEC TDB in the process of designing an information protection system both at the stage of modeling information security threats and defining security measures.\n\nATT&CK knowledge base implementation supposes realization of planning processes and direct emulation of attackers' actions, further results analysis, conclusions and suggestions formalization for improving both preventive measures to protect information, and mechanisms for detecting suspicious activity in a protected information infrastructure.\n\n\nStandard stages of forming requirements for a security system\n\nIt is required to introduce knowledge of actors' tactics and techniques into the process of forming requirements for the information protection system before evaluating defensive countermeasures.\n\nThe following generalized stages of requirements formation for an information security system can be distinguished In accordance with the world law: 1) Information system security class determination (minimum required level of information protection); 2) Information system structural and functional characteristics and modeling of information security threats determination: a) Information system structural and functional characteristics determination; b) Possible sources of information security threats identification (an intruder's model construction); c) Set of threats to the information security in accordance with the actor's potential determination; 3) Protection measures set determination (can be carried out in several stages, depending on the requirements of the legislation in different industries or countries); 4) Technical specifications development for the information security system creation.\n\nStructure of stages integration in process of requirements to information system protection formation presented in Fig. 1. The main thesis of the methodology built into the main stages of design will be described below. The main idea of the method is to determine the actor's techniques, which could potentially be implemented in the information system, in accordance with the structural and functional characteristics. The general scheme of the proposed method is presented in Fig. 2.\n\n\nA. Preparation stage\n\nIt is necessary to carry out preparatory measures in order to integrate knowledge about the actors' tactics and techniques into the process of designing an information protection system, the results will be shown later. The following actions are required:\n\n1) Determination of information technologies, structural and functional characteristics necessary for the implementation of each actors' actions from the ATT&CK base;\n\n2) Comparison of the obtained data on the information technologies used to implement the tactics and techniques with the classification of the influence objects presented in FSTEC.\n\nThe described actions are considered at the preliminary stage, since the results obtained in the process of their implementation are applied at the stage of threat modeling (Stage 2 of the information protection system design). Implementation Example is shown in Table 1. \n\n\nB. Threat modelling stage changes\n\nThe process of modeling threats to information security is supposed to be introduced with an additional list of actions to be performed, since the determination of actions techniques is carried out at this stage.\n\nThe stage involves the following actions:\n\n1) Determination of the information system structural and functional characteristics 2) Identification of possible sources of information security threats (construction of an intruder model)\n\n3) Definition of a range of threats to the information security from the FSTEC TDB in accordance with the actor's potential 4) Adaptation of a set of threats to information security in accordance to the structural and functional characteristics of the information system 5) Determination of tactics and techniques of the attacker's actions in accordance with the structural and functional characteristics of the information system and the information technologies used along with data obtained at the preliminary stage implementation.\n\nImplementation example is shown below.\n\nIt is necessary to select those techniques from Table 1, which are applicable to the information system. Several techniques were excluded for the selected information system. The results are presented in table 2.\n\n\n6)\n\nIdentification of current threats to information security in accordance to the applicable methodology, for example, [4], and also taking into account the assessment of potential damage to the information owner or personal data subject in case of violation of one of the information security properties (confidentiality, integrity, availability). The techniques can be considered as threats to the information security and apply to them the methodology for determining the actual threats as well as to threats from the Russian FSTEC. Suppose that all the techniques presented in table 1 were identified as relevant for the information system at the current stage.\n\n\nC. Security controls selection stages\n\nSelection of protective measures at the stage of determining the protective measures basic set is carried out in accordance with the requirements of Russian Federation legislation.\n\n\nImplementation example is presented below.\n\nA set of protection measures for an information system that processes personal data of the third security level in accordance with the FSTEC Order No. 21. is defined [5]. The proposed methodology includes the following sequence of steps at the stage of protection measures basic set adaptation:\n\n1) Definition of preventive measures to protect information (according to the data from the ATT&CK) for all techniques identified at the threat modeling stage Implementation Example is presented in Table 3. Update signatures of anti-virus protection tools control. Custom signatures for observed malware creation. Application of heuristic detection method Identify unnecessary system utilities or potentially malicious software that can be used to collect data from removable media, and block them using whitelist or software restriction policies 2) Adaptation of the basic set of protection measures, including the exclusion of measures related to information technologies, which are not used in the information system, or structural and functional characteristics that are not specific for the information system. So that, after adaptation, IAF.6 and IAF.20 can be excluded from the list of protective measures in this example.\n\n3) Comparison of the set of preventive measures obtained earlier in step 1 with the set of protective measures obtained in step 2.\n\nBased on the results of two sets comparison, it is necessary to determine the measures from point 1, the implementation of which is not required in accordance with the requirements for a certain class of system security (level of personal data or another information category protection) and remove them from consideration. Implementation example: MITRE researchers proposed measures to use intrusion detection and prevention tools, as well as measures to limit the software environment to prevent the possibility of implementing actor's techniques. Since the implementation of these measures is not required for the established level of protection of personal data processed in the system, they are not accepted for consideration at the stage of basic set of protection measures adaptation. However, due to the fact that actor's techniques can be implemented in the information system, measures can be taken to detect characteristic activity in the information system in accordance with the measures presented in ATT&CK and the analysts presented in CAR [6].\n\n\n4) Definition of measures to detect the actions in a compromised system\n\nDefinition of such measures can be carried out in different ways, depending on the level of the information security management process maturity in the organization.\n\nThe first method can be applied to organizations where is no possibility to implement the activities of several groups of people to emulate threats and investigate attacks, as well as organizing an integrated process for developing detection measures.\n\nThis method involves identifying analytics from the CAR database for implementation in the information system according to the previously defined set of actors' techniques of actions. It is recommended to select TTP type analytics predominantly, since they are aimed directly at identifying specific techniques of actors' actions.\n\nAnalytics are not presented for all attacker`s techniques. For those techniques for which there is no specific analytics, recommendations from the ATT&CK database can be selected for detection. Implementation example is shown in Table 4. At the moment, the methodology does not include the application of these databases at the stage of adapted basic set of information protection measures specification (stage 5 on Fig.1).\n\nAddition to the specified adapted basic set of protection measures provides definition of measures, which ensure compliance to the requirements for information protection, established by other regulatory acts / laws in the field of information security.\n\nThe developed security protection plan summarizes all the stages and allows to formulate the final requirements for the designed information security system. This document should reflect the requirements of both Russian Federation regulatory acts and measures, which were determined as a result of applying the methodology.\n\nTo sum it up, the integration of world experience knowledge of adversary`s tactics and techniques into the process of building information security systems makes it possible to conduct a direct relationship between information security threats, techniques of their implementation and methods of protecting and detecting the attackers` activity.\n\nProposed methodology, which takes into account techniques from the ATT&CK database at the stage of a threat modelling and an intruder model construction, makes it possible to apply software solutions for modeling adversaries` actions (adversary emulation tools). For instance, Caldera [7] and Metta [8] can be implemented in order to determine possible attack vectors for information infrastructure and evaluate of countermeasures effectiveness.\n\nFig. 1\n1Stages of information security system plan developing III.
