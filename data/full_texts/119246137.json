INTRODUCTION\n\nAn ongoing challenge in simulations of quantum spin systems is to reach larger lattices sizes, thus enabling more reliable extrapolations to the thermodynamic limit. With the advent of loop-cluster algorithms [1][2][3][4][5] and related schemes 6,7 developed since the mid-1990s, finite-temperature \u0351T\u0352 quantum Monte Carlo \u0351QMC\u0352 simulations have become possible on lattices with millions of spins for models with positivedefinite path integral \u0351world line\u0352 8,9 or stochastic series expansion \u0351SSE\u0352 \u0351Ref. 10\u0352 representation of the partition function. The computational effort scales linearly in the number of spins N. Since the effort also scales as 1 / T, simulations at very low T or in the ground state \u0351using T low enough to eliminate finite-T effects\u0352, are limited to smaller lattices, however. The ground state can typically be reached for \u03f710 4 spins.\n\nCurrently accessible system sizes suffice for studying ground states of many important models, e.g., the twodimensional \u03512D\u0352 Heisenberg model 11,12 and variants of it with nonuniform coupling patterns leading to quantum phase transitions of the antiferromagnet into a disordered ground state. 13,14 In other, similar systems there are still controversial issues 15,16 that may need larger lattices to be conclusively resolved. Larger lattice sizes are crucial in systems exhibiting more complex ground states and quantum phase transitions. One example of current interest is a class of \"J-Q\" models-2D Heisenberg models with four-spin interactions engineered to destroy the antiferromagnetic order and drive the system into a valence-bond-solid \u0351VBS\u0352 state. [17][18][19] The VBS state has intricate fluctuations and the true nature of its thermodynamic limit is only manifested on large lattices. 17 This illustrates the need to develop better groundstate methods, as a more efficient alternative to going to very low T with finite-temperature methods.\n\nIn this paper, we introduce a method combining loop updates first developed for finite-T simulations 1,2,5 with a ground-state projector QMC method operating in the VB basis. 20,21 This overcomplete singlet basis has some features that make it uniquely well suited for studies of spinrotationally invariant Hamiltonians such as the Heisenberg model and its extensions with multispin interactions. 17 It has been known for some time 2 that there is a simple and elegant relationship between VB states consisting of N / 2 pairs of spins forming singlets 22 and the loop algorithm, which indeed works by switching between a VB basis and a basis of N spins \u2191 and \u2193 \u0351for S = 1 2 systems\u0352. Here we exploit this switching for ground-state projections. An attractive feature of this approach is that it enables the use of very good singlet trial wave functions, the simplest example of which is the amplitude-product state proposed by Liang et al. 23,24 The ground state can then be reached much faster than with finite-T methods, and with much less computational effort than projector methods formulated purely in the VB basis. 20,25,26 In addition, we show that purely variational calculations can also be made more efficient by combining spins and VBs, including a loop update similar to one previously developed for classical dimer models. 27,28 The projector QMC algorithm with loops, working in the combined space of VBs and spins, is in the end very similar to T \u03fe 0 SSE and worldline loop algorithms. Essentially, the T = 0 projector approach corresponds to \"cutting open\" the periodic imaginary-time boundary and \"sealing\" the resulting open loop segments with valence bonds \u0351which serve as continuations of the loops\u0352.\n\nWe demonstrate the efficiency of the projector method by producing high-precision benchmark results for the sublattice magnetization of the 2D Heisenberg model with up to 256\u03eb 256 spins. We also discuss the properties of the variationally optimized amplitude-product states used as a trial states for the ground-state projections \u0351extending the results of Ref. 24 to larger lattices\u0352.\n\nWe begin in Sec. II by summarizing the properties of the VB basis needed for formulating the algorithms. In Sec. III, we discuss variational Monte Carlo simulations and optimization of amplitude-product states, and in Sec. IV, we describe the projector QMC method. We show results of both variational and projector calculations in Sec. V, and conclude in Sec. VI with a summary and discussion.\n\n\nII. VALENCE-BOND BASIS\n\nA VB state is a product of two-spin singlets,\n\u0351a,b\u0352 = \u0351\u0349\u2191 a \u2193 b \u0358 \u2212 \u0349\u2193 a \u2191 b \u0358\u0352/ \u0371 2,\n\n\u03511\u0352\n\nwhere a and b denote sites on sublattice A and B on a bipartite system. For N \u0351even\u0352 spins, there are \u0351N / 2\u0352! ways to draw the VBs, and hence the basis is massively overcomplete. The properties of VB states have been discussed extensively in the literature. 23,29,30 Here we will only summarize the most important aspects of the basis and introduce some notation needed for our algorithms.\n\nWe can formally use a label r =1, ... ,\u0351N / 2\u0352! for enumerating the VB configurations and denote a state as\n\u0349V r \u0358 = \u0349\u0351a 1 r ,b 1 r \u0352\u0351a 2 r ,b 2 r \u0352 ... \u0351a N/2 r ,b N/2 r \u0352\u0358. \u03512\u0352\nThe overlap between two VB states is\n\u0357V l \u0349V r \u0358 = 2 N loop \u2212N/2 , \u03513\u0352\nwhere N loop is the number of loops formed in the so-called transposition graph when the bonds in \u0349V l \u0358 and \u0349V r \u0358 are superimposed. An example is shown in Fig. 1. Like the overlap, matrix elements of operators of interest can typically also be related to the transposition-graph loops. 23,29,30 To compute spin-spin correlations, we will need\n\u0357V l \u0349S i \u00b7 S j \u0349V r \u0358 \u0357V l \u0349V r \u0358 = \u036d 0 if i j i j \u03513/4\u0352 if i = j ,\n\n\u036e \u03514\u0352\n\nwhere i = \u03ee 1 for sites on sublattice A and B, respectively, and i \u03551,N loop \u0356 is a label distinguishing the loop to which site i belongs. More complicated matrix elements and their relationships to the loop structure are discussed in Ref. 30. Figure 1 also shows one of the spin states,\n\u0349Z i r \u0358 = \u0349S 1 z \u0351r,i\u0352, ... ,S N z \u0351r,i\u0352\u0358, i = 1, ... ,2 N/2 , \u03515\u0352\ncontributing to both the VB states \u0351meaning that the spins on all bonds of the transposition graph are antiparallel\u0352. In Eq. \u03515\u0352, the index i refers to the allowed spin states in \u0349V r \u0358; the 2 N/2 states with antiparallel spins on every bond. With the sign convention in Eq. \u03511\u0352, the VB state can be written as\n\u0349V r \u0358 = 1 2 N/4 \u035a i=1 2 N/2 \u0351\u2212 1\u0352 A \u2191 \u0351r,i\u0352 \u0349Z i r \u0358, \u03516\u0352\nwhere A \u2191 \u0351r , i\u0352 denotes the number of \u2191 spins on sublattice A. The VB states thus obey the well-known Marshall sign rule, which ensures that the ground state has a positive-definite expansion in terms of them \u0353for an interaction with the same A-B bipartite structure as in the definition of the valence bonds, Eq. \u03511\u0352\u0354. When writing the overlap \u0353Eq. \u03513\u0352\u0354 using spin states,\n\u0357V l \u0349V r \u0358 = 1 2 N/2 \u035a i,j \u0357Z j l \u0349Z i r \u0358\u0351\u2212 1\u0352 A \u2191 \u0351r,i\u0352+A \u2191 \u0351l,j\u0352 , \u03517\u0352\nonly the terms with Z i r = Z j l contribute. Since the spins on every bond must be antiparallel, the spin configuration around a loop in the overlap graph must be staggered. The signs cancel and the sum then simply counts the number of such configurations. There are two staggered spin patterns for each loop, resulting in the overlap \u0353Eq. \u03513\u0352\u0354. Here we will use the equivalence between the two ways of expressing the overlap, Eqs. \u03513\u0352 and \u03517\u0352, as a starting point for constructing efficient variational and ground-state projector algorithms.\n\n\nIII. VARIATIONAL MONTE CARLO\n\nWe first discuss variational calculations, which we will use to construct good trial states for subsequent ground-state projection. An arbitrary singlet state \u0349\u233f\u0358 can be expanded in VB states,\n\u0349\u233f\u0358 = \u035a r w r \u0349V r \u0358. \u03518\u0352\nBecause of the overcompleteness, the expansion coefficients w r are not unique but this is not a problem in practice. In the variational state introduced by Liang et al., 23 the coefficients are taken to be products of bond amplitudes h\u0351r\u0352 \u03fe 0,\nw r = \u035f r h\u0351r\u0352 N r \u0351r\u0352 , \u03519\u0352\nwhere N r \u0351r\u0352 is the number of bonds of size r, where in a translationally invariant system, all applicable lattice symmetries can be used, e.g., for a 2D square lattice the amplitudes are h\u0351x , y\u0352, with x = \u0349r x \u0349 and y = \u0349r y \u0349 \u0351the components of the vector r defining the \"shape\" of the bond, transformed to the all-positive quadrant\u0352, and also h\u0351y , x\u0352 = h\u0351x , y\u0352.\n\nTo optimize the amplitudes using variational QMC simulations, the energy is written as \nE = \u0357\u233f\u0349H\u0349\u233f\u0358 \u0357\u233f\u0349\u233f\u0358 = \u035a lr W lr E lr \u035a lr W lr , \u035110\u0352\nwhere the weight W lr and energy estimator E lr are\nW lr = w l w r \u0357V l \u0349V r \u0358, E lr = \u0357V l \u0349H\u0349V r \u0358 \u0357V l \u0349V r \u0358 . \u035111\u0352\nFor a model with two-spin interactions \u0351to which the methods discussed here are not limited, 17,20 but for simplicity of the discussion we will not consider higher-order interactions here\u0352, the energy estimator is a sum of terms of the form \u03514\u0352.\n\nAs in any variational calculation, the idea is to compute E and its derivatives with respect to the amplitudes and then use this information to periodically adjust the amplitudes, in order to approach the energy minimum. Here we will not be concerned with the optimization aspect of the problem \u0351which is discussed in detail in Ref. 24, including also explicit expressions for evaluating the derivatives\u0352 but focus on the Monte Carlo sampling aspects of the problem.\n\n\nA. Monte Carlo sampling\n\nFor a given set of amplitudes, the VB configurations can be sampled according to the weight W lr by simple moves of bond pairs. 23 Choosing two sites on the same sublattice \u0351e.g., next-nearest neighbors on the square lattice\u0352, there are two allowed \u0351bipartite\u0352 configurations of the two bonds connected to these sites, and the Monte Carlo move amounts to switching from the current one to the other possible one. Such an update is illustrated in Fig. 2. The ratio W l \u0408 r \u0408 / W lr of the weights after \u0351W l \u0408 r \u0408 \u0352 and before \u0351W lr \u0352 the update is needed for the Metropolis acceptance probability,\nP accept = min\u036b W l \u0408 r \u0408 W lr ,1\u036c . \u035112\u0352\nThe ratio involves the amplitudes of the affected bonds from the amplitude product \u0353Eq. \u03519\u0352\u0354, as well as the ratio of the new to old overlap \u0353Eq. \u03513\u0352\u0354. Here the number of loops N loop can increase or decrease by 1. Determining this change requires tracing a loop going through one of the four sites involved in the two-bond move. Starting from one of these sites, the loop going through that site before the reconfiguration is followed, until some other site out of those four is reached. If that site is connected to the same bond as the initial site, then the four sites must belong to two different loops \u0351and after the move they will all be in the same loop, \nM s 2 = 1 N 2 \u035a ij i j S i \u00b7 S j = 1 N 2 \u035a =1 N loop L 2 , \u035113\u0352\nwhere L is the length of loop . For the single loop of length L i going through a randomly chosen site i, this relation becomes 2,31\n\u0357L i \u0358 = N\u0357M s 2 \u0358, \u035114\u0352\nwhere the averages refer to the Monte Carlo sampling. For systems with antiferromagnetic long-range order, there are system-spanning loops, 23,29 i.e., there are some loops of length L \u03f0 N in typical configurations. In this case, the computational effort of a sweep of \u03f0N two-bond updates therefore scales as N 2 .\n\nHere we avoid the loop-tracing step by reintroducing the spins into the sampling space, replacing the pure-bond overlap \u0353Eq. \u03513\u0352\u0354 with the equivalent expression \u03517\u0352. In addition to sampling the bond tilings V l , V r of the bra and ket states, we then also have to sample their compatible spin configurations Z i r = Z j l = Z i lr . A two-bond move cannot always be performed in this combined space since the reconfigured bonds may not be compatible with the current spin configuration. Starting with an allowed combined configuration \u0351V l , V r , Z i lr \u0352 \u0351an example of which is shown in Fig. 1\u0352, we carry out N / 2 two-bond attempts in each of the bond configurations V l , V r , and thereafter construct all VB loops and flip each loop \u0351i.e., flip all the spins in the loop\u0352 with probability 1/2. The number of operations required for one such full cycle of updates scales as N. In the scaling of the computational effort, we thus avoid the factor \u0357L loop \u0358 = N\u0357M s 2 \u0358. If there is antiferromagnetic order \u0351system-spanning loops, L loop \u03f0 N\u0352 or even in the absence of long-range order if the correlation length is large, the time savings of switching to the combined spin-bond basis is very large.\n\nIt is worth pointing out the reason why this method of avoiding to compute the overlap \u0353Eq. \u03513\u0352\u0354 works. It is because the combined Monte Carlo sampling of spins and bonds will, according to the standard detailed balance and ergodicity principles, automatically favor bond configurations for which there are more compatible spin configurations, on average exactly in proportion to the rewritten overlap, Eq. \u03517\u0352, which is just the number of spin configurations compatible with a given bond configuration. Thus, the overlap is taken into account probabilistically in the extended space, instead of being computed exactly in the pure VB space. One may ask whether this could lead to a worse performance of the combined bond-spin sampling relative to pure VB sampling. The bond sampling in the mixed space is constrained but, on the other hand, in the pure VB sampling a decreasing overlap after a bond reconfiguration \u0351which should occur in half of the updates\u0352 reduces the acceptance\na b c d a b c d FIG. 2.\n\u0351Color online\u0352 A two-bond update. For a pair of two sites on the same sublattice \u0351here a, c, as indicated by the brackets\u0352, the two bonds connected to them can be reconfigured in a unique way while maintaining the restriction of bipartite bonds. Detailed balance is then satisfied for updates toggling between the two configurations, with the Metropolis acceptance probability \u0353Eq. \u035112\u0352\u0354.\n\nrate. These two effects should, on average, balance each other, and thus the performance of the two methods should be similar when measured in terms of the number of bond updates performed. The sampling is, however, much faster in the combined space.\n\nNote also that measurements of observables can \u0351and normally should\u0352 still be carried out in the pure VB basis \u0351instead of measuring just the z components of, e.g., correlation functions\u0352, i.e., at this stage it does not matter what the spin configuration is, and one just considers rotationally invariant estimators, such as Eq. \u03514\u0352, in the pure VB basis. This corresponds exactly to summing over all compatible spin configurations, i.e., one can consider the VB \u0351loop\u0352 estimators as improved estimators. 2\n\n\nB. Bond-loop updates\n\nAs an alternative to sampling the VB states using the two-bond reconfigurations, one can also implement a loop update similar to one developed for classical dimer models. 27,28 The idea is to first move one end of a randomly chosen bond, thereby creating two defects \u0351an empty site and one site with two bonds\u0352 that should not be present in a valence-bond state. Subsequent bond moves are then carried out to move one of these defects, until it annihilates the second one \u0351the loop closes\u0352 and a new allowed bond configuration has been generated. The first step of such a loop update is illustrated in Fig. 3. \u0351Note that these loops are different from those in the rest of the paper\u0352.\n\nIn an algorithm \u0351as well as in an actual computer imple-mentation\u0352, it is convenient to represent the bonds by links between sites, stored in a one-dimensional array v\u0351i\u0352, i =1, ... ,N. Thus, if sites i and j are connected by a bond, then v\u0351i\u0352 = j and v\u0351j\u0352 = i. Starting at a randomly chosen site j 0 \u0351in either \u0349V l \u0358 or \u0349V r \u0358; here we consider \u0349V r \u0358 with the links stored in an array v r \u0352, the bond connected to it is considered for a reconfiguration. The bond will stay attached to its second site, i = v r \u0351j 0 \u0352, and the new other end, j, will be chosen according to probabilities proportional to the corresponding amplitudes h\u0351r ij \u0352. This is accomplished in practice by carrying out a bisection search for values bracketing a random number in \u03530,1\u0352 in a pregenerated table containing cumulative probabilities, i.e., normalized partial sums of the amplitudes. 32 If, for the chosen site j \u0353obtained by adding the chosen bond vector r to the current site i\u0354 the spin S z \u0351j\u0352 = S z \u0351i\u0352, the move would not be consistent with the spin configuration, and a new j should then be chosen \u0353repeatedly if necessary, until S z \u0351j\u0352 S z \u0351i\u0352 is satisfied\u0354. After moving the bond to an acceptable j, setting v r \u0351i\u0352 = j, this site will have two bonds on it \u0351but in the array v r the original link has been destroyed, which does not matter since it will no longer be needed\u0352, and the original site j 0 will have no bond attached to it \u0351unless the chosen site happens to be the starting site, j = j 0 , in which case the loop update is immediately terminated and another loop building is started from a new randomly chosen site 33 \u0352. To \"heal\" the double-bond defect at j, the end of the old bond connected to it is moved. This is done in the same way as for the initial bond move, with j 0 in the description above replaced by j. The procedures are repeated until it happens that j = j 0 , at which point the doublebond and no-bond defects annihilate each other and the loop closes. The loops can be large, and this kind of update should therefore be much more efficient than the local two-bond updates. The number of loops constructed in each updating sweep should be adjusted so that, on average, a number \u03f0N of bonds are moved.\n\nFor an amplitude-product state with nonzero amplitudes h\u0351r\u0352 for all r, the bisection search in the bond-loop update introduces a factor \u03f0ln\u0351N\u0352 in the time scaling of the algorithm, which may or may not \u0351depending on the nature of the state\u0352 be outweighed by shortened autocorrelation times relative to the two-bond updates. Note also that if the amplitudes are zero or very small beyond some distance r \u0351e.g., in the case of exponentially decaying amplitudes\u0352, the table of probabilities should only include those amplitudes with practically nonvanishing amplitudes, which also removes the ln\u0351N\u0352 factor from the scaling in such cases.\n\n\nIV. PROJECTOR MONTE CARLO\n\nWe now turn to the projector QMC method, using the Heisenberg model as a concrete example of loop updates for efficient ground-state projection of a variational state in the VB basis. We write the Hamiltonian on a bipartite lattice as\nH = \u2212 \u035a \u0357a,b\u0358 H ab , H ab = \u2212 \u0369S a \u00b7 S b \u2212 1 4 \u036a, \u035115\u0352\nwhere \u0357a , b\u0358 denotes nearest-neighbor sites. The bond operators H ab are singlet projectors \u0351equivalent to loop operators, 2 up to a factor of 2 and bipartite rotation\u0352 which can have two effects when acting on a VB state,\nH ab \u0351a,b\u0352 = \u0351a,b\u0352, \u035116\u0352 A B A B A B j 0 i j A B A B A B i FIG. 3.\n\u0351Color online\u0352 The first step in a bond-loop update. Open and solid circles indicate up and down spins compatible with the valence bonds. Given an initial site j 0 , the site i linked to it is identified. The bond \u0351j 0 , i\u0352 is then replaced by \u0351j , i\u0352, with j on the opposite sublattice from i and chosen probabilistically as discussed in the text. If S i z = S j z , the new bond configuration is not allowed, and a new j should be generated. The bond move results in one site with no bond and one with two bonds \u0351unless j = j 0 and the loop update is completed\u0352. The site linked by the old bond to the site with two bonds becomes site i for the following step. These procedures are repeated until the loop closes \u0351j = j 0 \u0352.\n\nH ad \u0351a,b\u0352\u0351c,d\u0352 = 1 2 \u0351a,d\u0352\u0351c,b\u0352. \u035117\u0352\n\nThese simple rules, and the absence of minus signs \u0351in the case of an unfrustrated system\u0352, enable a QMC scheme for projecting out the ground state \u0349\u233f 0 \u0358 from an arbitrary state \u0353Eq. \u03518\u0352\u0354 in the VB basis. 20,21,25 A. Ground-state projection\n\nIrrespective of the basis and Hamiltonian, the projector approach is based on the expression\n\u0351\u2212 H\u0352 m \u0349\u233f\u0358 = c 0 \u0351\u2212 E 0 \u0352 m \u036b \u03490\u0358 + \u035a n=1 \u2333\u22121 c n c 0 \u0369 E n E 0 \u036a m \u0349n\u0358 \u036c , \u035118\u0352\nwhere \u0349n\u0358, n =0, ... ,\u2333 \u2212 1 are the energy eigenstates in a Hilbert space of \u2333 states. If E 0 is the largest \u0351in magnitude\u0352 eigenvalue and the expansion coefficient c 0 0, then \u03490\u0358 \u03f0 \u0351\u2212H\u0352 m \u0349\u233f\u0358 for large m. In a QMC projector scheme, a high power of H and its action on the trial state \u0349\u233f\u0358 are sampled stochastically.\n\nTo this end, for the Heisenberg model we write \u0351\u2212H\u0352 m as a sum of all products of m bond operators and introduce the notation P \u2423 for such operator strings,\n\u0351\u2212 H\u0352 m = \u035a \u2423 \u035f i=1 m H a i \u2423 b i \u2423 = \u035a \u2423 P \u2423 , \u035119\u0352\nwhere \u2423 is a formal label for the different strings of singlet projectors. We write the state resulting when acting with a P \u2423 on a given VB state \u0349V r \u0358 as\nP \u2423 \u0349V r \u0358 = \u0369 1 2 \u036a o \u2423 r \u0349V r \u0351\u2423\u0352\u0358, \u035120\u0352\nwhere \u0349V r \u0351\u2423\u0352\u0358 is obtained in practice by successively applying the rules \u035116\u0352 and \u035117\u0352, which also gives the number o \u2423 \nW lr \u2423\u2424 = w l w r \u0357V l \u0351\u2424\u0352\u0349V r \u0351\u2423\u0352\u03582 \u2212\u0351o r \u2423 +o l \u2424 \u0352 , \u035122\u0352 O lr \u2423\u2424 = \u0357V l \u0351\u2424\u0352\u0349O\u0349V r \u0351\u2423\u0352\u0358/\u0357V l \u0351\u2424\u0352\u0349V r \u0351\u2423\u0352\u0358. \u035123\u0352\nThe expectation value can be evaluated by importance sampling, as discussed in Ref. 20. However, up until now the sampling was rather inefficient. Each random replacement of operators \u0351one or several; the number is adjusted to give a suitable acceptance rate\u0352 in P \u2423 requires a full propagation of the current VB state, counting o \u2423 r in Eq. \u035120\u0352, and thereafter counting N loop in the overlap \u0353Eq. \u03513\u0352\u0354. That is, unlike what is normally the case in Monte Carlo simulations, one here cannot simply determine the weight ratio locally when a small change is made in the configuration, and, hence, the full weight has to be computed in each update. This results in a scaling \u03f3max\u0351m 2 , Nm\u0352 of the computational effort involved in a full updating sweep. Here one factor m corresponds to the effort of propagating the full updated operator string. Constructing and counting the loops in the transposition graph \u0353Eq. \u03513\u0352\u0354 requires \u03f0N operations. If m \u04f7 N, this effort is swamped by the bond propagation, and the total effort of carrying out a number \u03f0m of updates \u0351needed to significantly change the operator sequence\u0352 is \u03f0m 2 whereas for the situation N \u03fe m \u0351which is less interesting in practice, as we will see when discussing the convergence properties\u0352, the effort is formally \u03f0Nm. When using an amplitude product as the trial state \u0351instead of a fixed bond configuration\u0352, we should also perform \u03f0N two-bond updates of the trial state, each of which demands the same computational effort as an operator replacement.\n\n\nB. Combined bond-spin space\n\nWe will now show how using the combined spin-bond basis brings the scaling of one updating sweep down from max\u0351m 2 , Nm\u0352 to \u03f3max\u0351N , m\u0352. We construct a loop update, which we here implement for the power \u0351\u2212H\u0352 2m in a way similar to the \"operator-loop\" update for e \u2212\u2424H , where \u2424 =1/ T, in the SSE representation 5 in T \u03fe 0 simulations. The operator-loop approach is analogous to the original loop method for world lines, 2 with the main difference that the sampling scheme is formulated in terms of insertions and removals of operators, instead of deforming world-line configurations. The formal relationships between the two approaches are discussed in Ref. 2. The SSE formulation is somewhat easier to relate directly to the present case of projector QMC. We could also project with e \u2212\u2424H , Taylor expanded as in the SSE method, but the fixed-power approach allows for some minor simplifications. The primary differences with respect to finite-T SSE simulations is then the fixed value of m and the VB \"end-cap\" boundaries in the \"propagation\" direction, replacing the periodic boundary conditions appropriate at finite T.\n\nTo make the analogy with the SSE loop method as close as possible, we split the singlet-projector operators H ab into their diagonal, H ab \u03511\u0352, and off-diagonal, H ab \u03512\u0352, parts,\nH ab \u03511\u0352 = \u0369 1 4 \u2212 S a z S b z \u036a, \u035124\u0352 H ab \u03512\u0352 = \u2212 1 2 \u0351S a + S b \u2212 + S a \u2212 S b + \u0352. \u035125\u0352\nWe use a superscript e on the operator string P \u2423 e in Eq. \u035119\u0352 to denote the 2 m different combinations of diagonal and offdiagonal operators for a given full-operator string P \u2423 . With spins Z i r , Z j l compatible with V r , V l , we sample VBs, spins, and operators, according to the weight,\nW lr,ij \u2423\u2424,ef = w l w r \u0369 1 2 \u036a 2m+N/2 \u03f0 w l w r ,\u035126\u0352\nunder the condition P \u2423 e \u0349Z i r \u0358 = P \u2424 f \u0349Z j l \u0358. The constraints exactly compensate for the other factors in the original weight \u0353Eq.\n\n\u035122\u0352\u0354 and there is no explicit dependence in Eq. \u035126\u0352 on the operator string \u0351\u2423 , \u2424 , e , f\u0352 and spin \u0351i , j\u0352 indices. An example configuration is shown in Fig. 4. On a bipartite lattice, the weights are positive since minus signs present in the states \u0353Eq. \u03516\u0352\u0354 compensate those arising from an odd number of off-diagonal operators \u0353Eq. \u035125\u0352\u0354 \u0351or, equivalently, all signs could be eliminated by a sublattice rotation 2 \u0352.\n\n\nC. Sampling method\n\nWe now briefly describe the Monte Carlo sampling procedures. Starting with VB configurations V r , V l \u0351where normally one would take V r = V l for simplicity\u0352 and compatible spin configurations Z r = Z l , an initial string containing only diagonal operators H ab \u03511\u0352 can be used \u0351consistent with the constraint that each operator must act on two antiparallel spins\u0352. Successive configurations maintaining the constraints are generated with three types of updates.\n\nIn the first update-the \"diagonal update\"-the combined string P \u2423\u2424 ef = \u0351P \u2424 f \u0352 T P \u2423 e \u0351where the transpose T of an operator sequence just corresponds to writing it in the reverse order, corresponding to acting with it on a bra state instead of a ket\u0352 containing 2m operators is traversed and each diagonal operator in it is updated \u0351moved to a randomly selected bond\u0352, under the condition that it acts on antiparallel spins. This step corresponds to changing the vertex breakup in the original world-line loop scheme. 1,2 As in the SSE method, 5,10 the constraints are checked by keeping the single state Z\u0351p \u22121\u0352, which is needed for moving a diagonal operator at location p in the string. This state is obtained by acting on the originally stored ket spin configuration Z r \u03510\u0352 = Z r with the first p operators in the sequence. It is changed \u0351by flipping two spins\u0352 whenever an off-diagonal operator is encountered in the course of traversing the positions p =1, ... ,2m. At the end of this procedure, the stored bra state is obtained, Z r \u03512m\u0352 = Z l , for a valid configuration.\n\nIn a second updating stage-the loop update-a linked list of operator vertices is first constructed. A vertex consists of the spin states \"entering\" and \"exiting\" an operator, as shown in Fig. 4. They connect, forming loops. The only difference with respect to the operator loops in the SSE method is that a loop can now be connected to the ket or bra VB state, and the valence bonds constitute parts of such loops \u0351replacing the periodic boundary conditions used at T \u03fe 0\u0352. To keep nonzero \u0351indeed, constant\u0352 matrix elements of the operators H ab , all spins on a loop have to be flipped together, in the process changing also H ab \u03511\u0352 \u2194 H ab \u03512\u0352. Each loop is flipped with probability 1/2. In practice, all loops are constructed, and the random decision of whether or not to flip a loop is made before the loop is constructed. Vertices in a loop that is not to be flipped are just flagged as visited so that the same loop is not traversed more than once \u0351i.e., a loop construction is always started from a vertex leg that has not yet been visited\u0352.\n\nThe reason for constructing all the clusters and flipping each with probability 1/2, instead of generating single clusters starting from random seed locations and flipping them with probability 1 \u0351as in the classical Wolff method 31 \u0352, is that the de facto loop structure is only changed when performing the diagonal updates. One would therefore potentially generate the same cluster several times, which would lead to lower efficiency compared to uniquely identifying all clusters and flipping each at most once. In principle, one could modify the algorithm with combined diagonal and cluster updates but this is more complicated and would probably not lead to improvements in efficiency in most cases.\n\nA flipped loop including one or several VBs will cause spin flips in the stored spin configurations Z l or Z r . In the loop updating procedure, we do not have to explicitly keep track of any other spins than those in Z l and Z r . The four spins at the operators \u0351the vertex legs\u0352 are irrelevant at the loop updating stage because all the vertices automatically involve only operations on antiparallel spins, both before and after a loop flip. For each vertex encountered when constructing a loop, we therefore simply have to change the operator-type index, 1 \u2194 2, in the list of operators \u0351i.e., the same list P \u2423\u2424 ef used in the diagonal update and to construct the linked vertex list\u0352.\n\nThe third type of update-the state update-is identical to the VB reconfigurations described in Sec. III for the variational calculation. Normally one would use an amplitudeproduct state with coefficients in Eq. \u03519\u0352, which enter in the weight \u0353Eq. \u035126\u0352\u0354. Reconfigurations of the bonds can be carried out with either two-bond or bond-loop moves, as explained in Sec. III. They only change the loop connections at the VB \"end caps.\"\n\n\nD. Measuring observables\n\nWhen measuring operator expectation values, one can go back to a pure VB \u0351=loop\u0352 representation, using the estimator \u0353Eq. \u035123\u0352\u0354. This corresponds to summing over all loop orientations. Most quantities of interest can be expressed in terms of the loops in the transposition graph corresponding to \u0357V l \u0351\u2424\u0352\u0349V r \u0351\u2423\u0352\u0358. 2,23,29,30 Note that these transposition-graph loops can also be obtained from the \"space-time\" loops constructed in the updates, by connecting the sites \u0351in practice, just assigning a label, the loop number i \u0352 crossed by the same loop at the propagation midpoint \u0351indicated by a dashed line in Fig. 4\u0352. The space-time loops can also provide access to imaginary-time correlation functions 2 in the ground state \u0351see Sec. IV A\u0352. Since there are no differences in the FIG. 4. \u0351Color online\u0352 A VB-spin-operator configuration contributing to \u0357\u233f\u0349\u0351\u2212H\u0352 2m \u0349\u233f\u0358 for a four-site system with m = 2. The arcs to the left and right indicate VB states \u0357V l \u0349, \u0349V r \u0358 and the two columns of filled and open circles represent \u2191 and \u2193 spins of compatible spin states \u0357Z j l \u0349, \u0349Z j r \u0358. The spins at the four operators \u0351verti-ces\u0352 are also indicated. There are three loops, part of which consist of VBs. Expectation values are evaluated at the midpoint indicated by the dashed line. measurement procedures for equal-time observables with respect to the original VB projector algorithm, we refer to the literature for this aspect of the simulations. 20,21,30 In some applications, instead of measuring a ground-state expectation value \u03570\u0349A\u03490\u0358, one is interested in matrix elements of the form \u0357R\u0349A\u03490\u0358, where \u0349R\u0358 is a reference state, normally the N\u00e9el state in the z-component basis. This corresponds to sampling the wave function itself \u0351generating the basis states with probability proportional to the positivedefinite wave-function coefficients\u0352. The energy \u0351including excitation energies in different momentum sectors\u0352 can be computed like this, 20,21 and also calculations of entanglement entropy can be formulated in this way. [34][35][36] A mixed matrix element can also easily be sampled in the spin-bond basis. In this case, the loops terminating on the state \u0349R\u0358 should never be flipped because \u0349R\u0358 is a single-spin configurations \u0351in the case of the N\u00e9el state-other reference states are also possible and would require other rules for the boundary loops\u0352.\n\n\nV. RESULTS\n\nAs a demonstration of the efficiency of the methods, we present results for the sublattice magnetization M s of the 2D Heisenberg model. This quantity has been calculated in numerous previous studies, but the currently best published estimate, M s = 0.3070\u03513\u0352, obtained on the basis of T \u03f7 0 QMC results for L up to 16, is already more than ten years old. 12 Recently, the density-matrix renormalization-group method was used to calculate M s on rectangular lattices with N \u03f7 200 sites, giving a result consistent with the above value and with a similar precision. 37 Results have also been obtained using finite-T data and scaling forms that, in principle, allow simultaneous T \u2192 0, L \u2192 \u03f1 extrapolations. With L up to 160 and 1 / T up to 12, Ref. 38 reported M s = 0.30793\u03513\u0352. This is higher than \u0351and well outside the error bars of\u0352 the T = 0 results cited above. In order to resolve the discrepancy, it would be useful to have ground-state results based on larger lattices. Here we consider L up to 256.\n\nBelow we first discuss convergence aspects of the VB method, including the behavior with different trial states, and then present results and finite-size extrapolation of the sublattice magnetization.\n\n\nA. Variational calculations\n\nWe first discuss the amplitude-product states used as trial states for the ground-state projection. The quality of the variationally optimized states \u0353i.e., all amplitudes h\u0351x , y\u0352 were determined by variational Monte Carlo simulations, as explained in Sec. III\u0354 is illustrated in Fig. 5 for system sizes L up to 80. Results for up to L = 32 were previously presented in Ref. 24-here we improve slightly on those results, thanks to the more efficient sampling procedures allowing for better statistics for the computed derivatives. The results are compared to converged results of the QMC projector method \u0351which can be considered as exact to within small statistical errors that are not visible in the graphs\u0352. The relative error of the variational energy is \u03fd0.1% for large systems. The sublattice magnetization falls on a smooth curve in good agree-ment \u0351better than 1%\u0352 with the projected data for L up to \u03f724. For larger systems, the behavior becomes erratic, however, being higher or lower \u0351outside the error bars\u0352 than the projected data in a seemingly random way. This can be explained as due to the energy becoming less sensitive to the long-range spin correlations for increasing L, i.e., there are states with significantly different sublattice magnetizations but energy expectation values that are the same to within the precision of the simulations. To obtain the correct best sublattice magnetization for large L \u0351corresponding to the minimum energy determined to extreme precision\u0352 with the variational approach therefore requires unreasonably long simulations \u0351which is true in general in variational calculations; not just with the amplitude-product states used here\u0352.\n\n\nB. Convergence of the ground-state projection\n\nTurning now to results of the projector method, it is useful to test the convergence as a function of the projection power m for different trial wave functions. Clearly, the preferred option is to use the best variational state available but optimizing an amplitude-product state also takes some time \u0351depending on how close to the energy minimum one strives\u0352, and, as we have seen above, for large systems it may not even be possible to find the truly optimal amplitudes. Figure  6 shows the energy and the sublattice magnetization for L = 32 versus m / N, obtained using trial states with amplitudes h\u0351r\u0352 =1/ r p , p =2,3,4, without any optimization, as well as with amplitudes obtained in two independent optimization runs. It is known 24,39 that the optimal amplitudes decay as 1 / r 3 asymptotically but the short-bond amplitudes show deviations from this form. Indeed, the best convergence is seen for p = 3 but with optimized amplitudes, the convergence is still much faster. Although the two optimized variational states have very similar energies, there are still clear differences in the convergence of the sublattice magnetization, related to the insensitivity of the variational energy to the longdistance spin correlations. In some cases, the convergence of the sublattice magnetization is nonmonotonic \u0351while the energy always has to converge monotonically\u0352, as illustrated in Fig. 7. The behavior depends on details of the variationally optimized amplitudes; likely nonmonotonicity can be traced to incomplete optimization.\n\n\nC. Extrapolation of the sublattice magnetization\n\nWe now discuss large-scale calculations for the 2D Heisenberg model. We have calculated M s 2 as well as the spin-correlation function C\u0351L / 2,L / 2\u0352, which equals M s 2 when L \u2192 \u03f1, for lattices with L up to 256, making sure that the results are well converged to the ground state in all cases. The raw data are listed in Table I The results are graphed versus 1 / L in Fig. 8, along with polynomial fits 11 used to extrapolate to L = \u03f1. The extrapolated M s 2 and C\u0351L / 2,L / 2\u0352 agree statistically and are stable with respect to the range of L included and the order of the polynomials. The statistics is slightly better for C and the polynomial needed to fit it is one order smaller than for M s 2 . Based on C, we estimate M s = 0.30743\u03511\u0352, somewhat above the previous T = 0 results. 12,37 The error bar is more than an order of magnitude smaller. The higher value from finite-T simulations 38 can be ruled out \u0351differing by more than 15 of its error bars from our result\u0352. This illustrates difficulties with unknown corrections to the \u0351T , L\u0352 scaling forms. Extrapolating T = 0 properties directly as a function of a single parameter \u03511 / L\u0352 can in general be expected to be more reliable. Indeed, since the appearance of the \u0351unpublished\u0352 original short version of the present FIG. 6. \u0351Color online\u0352 Convergence of the energy \u0351lower panel\u0352 and the squared sublattice magnetization \u0351upper panel\u0352 for L =32 states projected using different trial states; amplitude-product states with amplitudes h\u0351r\u0352 =1/ r p \u0351p =2,3,4\u0352 as well as with h\u0351x , y\u0352 determined by minimizing the energy \u0351in two independent optimizations, giving slightly different amplitudes\u0352.   paper, 40 the results of Ref. 38 have been recalculated and revised 41 and now agree with our results.\n\n\nVI. SUMMARY AND DISCUSSION\n\nWe have shown how reintroducing the spins into the VB basis allows for much faster sampling of amplitude-product states and, in particular, very efficient ground-state projector simulations. For variational calculations, it saves a factor up to system size N, and for projector QMC a factor up to the projection power m, bringing the total computational effort from O\u0351m 2 \u0352 to O\u0351m\u0352 \u0351where normally m \u04f7 N, i.e., the improvements can be orders of magnitude\u0352. One striking and appealing aspect of the projector algorithm is its close similarity with state-of-the-art T \u03fe 0 QMC loop methods, in particular, the SSE variant 5 but also the world-line approach \u0351for which loop updates similar to those used here were originally developed 1,2 \u0352. Essentially, the T = 0 projector approach corresponds to cutting open the periodic imaginary-time boundary condition used at T \u03fe 0 and terminating the resulting free loop ends with valence bonds \u0351which act as continuations of the loops\u0352. It is therefore very easy to rewrite, e.g., an SSE program for T = 0 projection. A favorable aspect of the T =0 projector approach is that VB amplitude-product states often are very good trial states \u0351as noted already a long-time ago 23,25 \u0352, which helps substantially to achieve a fast convergence as a function of the power m of the projection operator H m .\n\n\nA. Discussion\n\nIn view of the similarity with T \u03fe 0 methods, it is worth asking how much faster a converged T = 0 simulation is than a T \u03fe 0 simulation carried out at T sufficiently low for obtaining ground-state properties. To answer this question, we first need to compare directly the size of the configuration space of the two formulations. Consider the SSE method, which is based on sampling the Taylor expansion of e \u2212\u2424H . 10 The average of the expansion power n is given by \u0357n\u0358 = \u2424\u0349E\u0349, where E is the total energy \u0351\u03f0N\u0352, which includes for each bond \u0351in the case of the S =1/ 2 Heisenberg model\u0352 an added constant \u22121 / 4 \u0353exactly as in the singlet-projector operator in Eq. \u035115\u0352\u0354. Let us consider the 2D Heisenberg model, where for large systems, the energy per site is \u03f7\u22120.67, which, including the constant \u22121 / 4, corresponds to \u0349E\u0349 / N \u03f7 1.2 Thus, the average expansion power \u0357n\u0358\u03f71.2N\u2424. In the projector approach, the number of operators in the sequence is 2m, and thus the computational efforts of the two methods should be comparable if m / N \u03f7 0.6\u2424 \u0351since there is only a very small overhead in sampling in the projector scheme, related to the boundary VB states\u0352. In Fig. 9, we show results of the two methods versus these normalized parameters for L = 64. A much faster convergence of the projector approach can be seen, especially for the energy. It is clear that here the fact that the trial state is well optimized plays a big rolewith a very poorly optimized trial state the T \u03fe 0 approach may even converge faster.\n\nIt should be noted that the loop estimators used in QMC calculations at T \u03fe 0 are exactly equivalent to VB estimators, 2 such as Eq. \u03514\u0352, if T is low enough for a simulation to sample only the singlet subspace, whereas at higher T some loops-those that change the total magnetization when flipped-correspond to higher spin contributions.\n\nAn important difference between the T = 0 and T \u03fe 0 approaches should be pointed out in this context. To improve the statistics in T \u03fe 0 simulations, one can take advantage of the periodic \"time\" boundaries. Averages of observables can be computed over all the propagated states. Whether or not this is a significant advantage in practice depends on the observable \u0351its autocorrelation function as a function of imaginary time, which determines the effective number of independent measurements generated\u0352. In some cases, the averaging can be carried out almost without overhead. At first sight, it might appear that no averaging of this kind can be done with the projector method since the matrix elements of observables are defined at the midpoint of the configuration \u0351as indicated in Fig. 4\u0352. One can of course shift the measurement point, and average over several such points, although then either the ket or the bra might not be equally well converged to the ground state. In practice, this kind of averaging may, however, still pay off, although we have not investigated it quantitatively. Note also that quantities given in terms of Kubo integrals \u0351susceptibilities\u0352 explicitly require access to imaginary-time correlation functions, which can, in principle, be measured in the projector scheme by using the space-time loops constructed in the updates. 2 It would then be better to formulate using the Taylor expansion of e \u2212\u2424H instead of a fixed power \u0351\u2212H\u0352 m , and one would require longer projections than equal-time correlations, long enough for the imaginary-time correlator to have decayed below some small number beyond which further contributions can be neglected. These issues are common to projector methods and have been investigated and discussed in detail in the context of fermionic auxiliary-field QMC calculations. 42,43 \n\n\nB. Related calculations and outlook\n\nThe possibility to use the valence-bond basis in QMC simulations was first suggested more than 20 years ago. 25 It is also implicitly the basis for the loop algorithm. 2 Simulations methods explicitly formulated in the VB basis became more widely used only recently, after its generic utility, including simplified access to many physical quantities, was pointed out. 20,21,30 We briefly list some works where the unique aspects of the VB basis where exploited in such simulations, and where the improvements presented here can be expected to lead to further progress.\n\nAlet et al. 34 and, independently, Chhajlany et al. 35 defined a VB entanglement entropy, which can be evaluated using ground-state projection \u0351unlike other entropy definitions, which normally cannot be directly evaluated\u0352. 34 A different variant of this entanglement measure was proposed by Lin and Sandvik, who also introduced another measure, the loop entanglement entropy, based on the loops in the transposition graph. 44 Hastings et al. recently showed that one of the standard definitions of entanglement entropy, the Renyi S 2 entropy, in fact also can be evaluated with VB simulations. 36 These developments will allow, e.g., tests of the \"area law\" of entanglement entropy and deviations from it in a wide range of quantum spin systems.\n\nBeach et al. have extended the VB projector scheme for standard SU\u03512\u0352 spins to an often used representation of SU\u0351N\u0352 invariant models, 45 including also the possibility of continuously varying N. 46 This extension is of interest as many analytical theories are formulated as large-N expansions, and it is useful to make direct contact between this approach and unbiased numerical calculations. Using a similar approach, Tran et al. have carried out VB simulations of a chain of nonabelian SU\u03512\u0352 k particles \u0351where k is related to the central charge\u0352, 47 generalizing the standard S =1/ 2 Heisenberg chain. One can also consider effective hamiltonians explicitly constructed in the VB basis. 48 One of the first applications of the pure VB projector method was to the J-Q model; a potential realization of \"deconfined\" quantum criticality. 17 Since the appearance of the unpublished original short version of the present paper, 40 the improved VB loop method has already been used to study SU\u0351N\u0352 versions of the J-Q model with N = 3 and 4. 49 Here it can be noted that the variational amplitude-product states can also be extended to allow for valence-bond-solid order \u0351by introducing factors favoring or disfavoring various local short-bond configurations\u0352, which is useful for studying J-Q models in the VBS phase. 50 The spin texture around a nonmagnetic impurity in the J-Q model has been studied with the spin-bond sampling algorithm with an extra unpaired spin. 51 Triplet excitations of random antiferromagnetic clusters were investigated with VB simulations including a triplet VB in the background of singlets by Wang and Sandvik, 52 a measurement which also can be carried out with two unpaired parallel spins. Measurements of triplet excitations for fixed momentum were discussed in Ref. 21.\n\nFinally, we note that the loop-based projector scheme that we have presented here for isotropic-spin systems can, in principle, be extended to anisotropic models as well 2,7 \u0351and also to more complex bosonic systems, as well as fermions in one dimensions\u0352. The difference will be that the variational trial states appropriate in most other cases would not have natural expressions in the singlet valence-bond basis. As an example, consider the case of a variational wave function written just in terms of the z components of the spins \u0351e.g., a Jastrow state\u0352. There is then some weight \u0351wavefunction coefficient\u0352 W\u0351\u0355S i z \u0356\u0352 for the trial state, and normally this weight will change when a loop terminating at the trial state is flipped. The loops in this case would be of the \"directed\" type, 7 and one could build in the weight change coming from the trial state into the directed loop equations \u0351which dictate the probabilities for the loop building along different paths through the vertices\u0352. This approach may be more efficient than the Green's function or diffusion Monte Carlo methods 53 normally used for ground-state projection of a variational trial state.\n\nFIG. 1 .\n1\u0351Color online\u0352 Transposition graph of VB states on a 5 \u03eb 4 lattice with sublattices A and B indicated with open and solid circles.
