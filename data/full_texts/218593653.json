Every year, at various locations of the world, zillions of lives are affected by the drought. Drought is a recurrent extreme climatic condition over land that has varying timescales. The functional classification of various types of droughts namely, permanent, seasonal, and contingent are based on the rainfall deficits that accumulate over different timescales (Thornthwaite 1948). A prolonged deficit in precipitation can prompt a variety of adverse ecological consequences, such as shortage in water supply, low agricultural produce, reduced soil moisture, and disparity of ecosystem functions (Jha 2010). Owing to the variability of intensity, duration, 221 Page 2 of 18 and spatial extent of droughts, it is often difficult to quantify the severity and its impacts or environmental damages using a single drought index. Globally, drought has wider impacts on agriculture, socio-economic aspects of people, ecology, and wildlife habitats (Kallis 2008). Additionally, drought also prompts a massive relocation of the population for alternate livelihoods, induce stress on human life triggering suicides, starvation, or unhygienic conditions (Ding et al. 2011). Drought impacts are more severe in arid and semi-arid climatic regions leading to desertification of sizeable areas. Advanced drought forecasting systems are crucial to avert the consequences of droughts by proper planning, proofing, and implementing mitigation schemes. These early warning techniques include the use of indices to track the drought conditions (Zargar et al. 2011).\n\nIndia has witnessed 22 major drought years over the past 150 years (Samra 2004). Large parts of the country have suffered from recurring drought events. Over the years, scientists of different domains such as meteorologists, hydro-geologists, ecologists, etc. have focused on intensive research on droughts. However, the most important aspect of drought studies lies in the forecasting of future drought scenarios. In the literature, an ample number of drought indices exist, such as Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI), Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI), Crop-Specific Drought Index (CSDI), Palmer Drought Severity Index (PDSI), Bhalme-Mooley Drought Index (BMDI), Percent of Normal Precipitation (PNP), Effective Drought Index (EDI), etc. (Mishra and Singh 2011). The SPI is a quite flexible index where only precipitation data are needed for the calculation of SPI of different time scales, that help assess drought severity. Similarly, SPEI is an extension of the SPI designed to take into account both precipitation and potential evapotranspiration (PET) while defining drought intensities (Vicente-Serrano et al. 2010). The PDSI employs readily available temperature and precipitation data along with water balance information to identify long-term agricultural droughts. PDSI can identify drought conditions affecting a crop, but do not consider specific crop responses and their likely impact on yields due to the drought event (Alley 1984). Hence, to directly link the drought impacts on specific crop production, CSDI was developed to identify the overall impact of drought stress on the final yield (Meyer et al. 1993). Accordingly, the month-to-month variations in precipitation are taken into consideration in BMDI for detecting drought events (Bhalme and Mooley 1980). The PNP index demonstrates whether the decadal precipitation was above or underneath the 30-year normal over the region of interest (Eslamian et al. 2017). To detect the duration, onset, and end of water deficit periods, EDI was developed for monitoring both agricultural and meteorological drought situations (Byun and Wilhite 1999). Among all the drought indices, SPI is the most commonly used due to its ease of computation and the flexibility in choosing different time Fig. 1 Location of Study Area-Gulbarga district, Karnataka, India scales compared to others. It also allows the users to predict the possibility of occurrence or recurrence of droughts of varying severities (Guttman 1998).\n\nPreviously, several statistical and machine learningbased time series models have been used for forecasting of drought by means of SPI and other indices. Auto-Regressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA), Seasonal ARIMA, recursive multi-step, and direct multi-step models based on neural networks were tested to forecast droughts using SPI time series (Mishra and Desai 2005;Han et al. 2013;Bazrafshan et al. 2015;Karavitis et al. 2015). Artificial Neural Network (ANN)-based forecast models of 1-12 month lead time were developed taking the advantage of SPI and EDI indices by Morid et al. (2007). The suitability of Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS) for SPI-based drought forecasting at different time scales was tested and compared with that of Feed Forward Neural Networks (FFNN) by Bacanli et al. (2009). Nonlinear aggregated drought index (NADI)-based drought conditions were forecasted using ANN approach by Barua et al. (2012). Machine learning has the major challenge in data acquisition. Also, based on different algorithms, data need to be processed. Wavelet transformation has been employed for pre-processing the data for efficiently unveiling the attributes of data in terms of trends, breakdown, and discontinuities (Kim and Vald\u00e9s 2003). Several SPI-based drought forecasting studies applying Wavelet Neural Networks (WNN) (Belayneh and Adamowski 2012;Djerbouai and Souag-Gamane 2016), Wavelet-ANFIS (Shirmohammadi et al. 2013), Support Vector Machine (SVM) (Belayneh et al. 2014;Jalalkamali et al. 2015), Wavelet-SVM (Belayneh et al. 2016), Random Forest (RF) (Chen et al. 2012), and Wavelet-Linear Genetic Programming (WLGP) (Danandeh Mehr et al. 2014) techniques are available in the literature. Contingent upon data characteristics and forecasting horizon wavelet-based techniques were found to improve the forecasting efficiency of standalone ML models. The authors recommend referring to Fung et al. (2019) for gaining a detailed and informative overview of various model concepts applied to drought forecasting and their historical applications.\n\nSome limitations of using wavelet analysis include: it increases the model complexity, since a single time series is split into two subsets, namely, the approximation and detail coefficients, and a suitable wavelet function that fits best with the data has to be chosen. As the number of approximation levels increase, the sources of error also escalate due to dimensionality. Without mounting the dimensionality, the wavelet packet transform is known to offer perfect level by level resolution of any non-stationary time series signal by dividing the frequency axis into finer intervals (Coifman et al. 1992). Till date, the wavelet analysis, specifically the discrete wavelet transform and continuous wavelet transform, has been adopted for forecasting drought severity scenarios. On the contrary, the competence of wavelet packet transform has not been investigated for data pre-processing of SPI data for forecasting drought severity scenarios. Hence, the objective of the current study was to develop efficient hybrid approaches for improving the drought forecasting accuracy. To quantify the drought severity, the SPI was computed and used. By coupling Wavelet Packet (WP) data transformation method with ANN and SVR paradigms,  Moderately wet + 1.5 to + 1.99\n\nSeverely wet > (+ 2) Extreme wet two hybrids WP-ANN and WP-SVR models have been established to forecast SPI 6 and SPI 12 with a lead period of 1 and 6 months, respectively. The wavelet packet transform pre-processed SPI data were used as inputs for ANN and SVR models to establish WP-ANN and WP-SVR hybrid models. The performance of the hybrid models was then compared with that of the standalone ANN and SVR models to verify the accuracy or enhancement in drought forecasting. The fine resolution daily gridded precipitation data (0.25\u00b0 \u00d7 0.25\u00b0) procured from Indian Meteorological Department (IMD) of 21 grid locations within the study area for the period of 1985-2013 have been used in this study.\n\n\nStudy area\n\nGulbarga is one of the semi-arid districts of Karnataka state, India (Fig. 1). It is located in the northern part of Karnataka between the east longitudes 76\u00b0 04' and 77\u00b0 42' and north latitudes 17\u00b0 12' and 17\u00b0 46'. Gulbarga district encompasses a geographical area (10,954 km 2 ) of about 5.93% of the total area of Karnataka state. The Gulbarga district represents an extensive deforested plateau having undulating landscape with elevation in the range 300-750 m above mean sea level. The Krishna and Bhima are the two main rivers flowing in the district and are devoid of lofty ranges of hills. The region experiences a dry climate, with temperature variations between 8 \u00b0C and 45 \u00b0C. The district receives an average annual rainfall in the range 673-702 mm. The day temperature ranges between 42 \u00b0C in the summer and 26 \u00b0C in winter. Several taluks of Gulbarga district experience mild drought conditions persistently in spite of consistent rainfall (CGWB 2008). According to K\u00f6ppen and Geiger, the climate of Gulbarga is classified as 'Aw' (Peel et al. 2007).\n\nIn the present study, 21 grid locations were selected and SPI was forecasted for all these locations. The position details of the selected 21 locations are presented in Fig. 2. McKee et al. (1993) developed the most versatile standardized precipitation index (SPI) which is a numerical representation of drought severity, calculated using precipitation as input. SPI is a meteorological drought index calculated by fitting the long-term precipitation data to a mathematical distribution, which is cumulative for a certain time scale. Usually, a gamma distribution is achieved by fitting the long-term precipitation data and then converted to a normal distribution through probability theory, such that the mean SPI for the location and desired period is zero. The SPI value > 0 indicates wet periods, with region receiving precipitation more than median; on the other hand, SPI value < 0 indicates drought periods with region receiving precipitation lesser than the median value. The negative SPI values represent a dry period and its severity (Edwards and McKee 1997). Necessary mitigation decisions can be made when SPI values are forecasted in advance. In this study, SPI was estimated from the monthly rainfall data of 1985-2013 (29 years) over Gulbarga district, Karnataka. SPI calculation is based only on precipitation data which makes it apt for drought quantification in areas where there is shortcoming of other data. The SPI could be calculated on multiple timescales, and henceforth, it is compatible for accounting various drought types. In the year 2009, World Meteorological Organization (WMO) endorsed SPI as a leading meteorological drought index, and recommended to the world for the utilization of index to monitor the drought scenarios (WMO 2012). In the present study, the SPI is analyzed for the period of 6 and 12 months. SPI for shorter interval scales (1 month or 3 months) was not considered in the study, since SPI 1 or SPI 3 may lead to ambiguous results for the location considered, where it is usually dry for three continuous months. For instance, in Gulbarga, the period of January-March is characterized by no or little rain, the corresponding historical totals will also be small, and so if there is even slight variation on both side of the mean, then it will result in large values of positive or negative SPI. The C++ based SPI program (SPI_SL_6.exe) developed by the National Drought Mitigation Centre in the University of Nebraska-Lincoln (WMO 2012) was used for the calculating the SPI time series; for each of the 21 grids locations of the Gulbarga district. The SPI-based drought intensity classification is as provided in the Table 1. The onset of drought event occurs any time when the magnitude of SPI is continuously negative and reaches -1.0 or less. When the SPI becomes positive the drought event ends. A 6-month SPI (SPI 6) forecast of 1-month lead time will provide a 1-month warning time of SPI 6 (i.e., rainfall conditions over a 6-month period); desirable for early warning. Similarly, a forecast of 6-month lead time of SPI 6 will provide a 6-month before warning time and also allows us to know the seasonal variation of precipitation in any year. Correspondingly, a 12-month SPI (SPI 12) allows for comparison of the rainfall of 12 successive months with the rainfall of equivalent 12 months of earlier years of available data.\n\n\nStandardized precipitation index (SPI)\n\n\nTheoretical overview\n\n\nArtificial neural network\n\nArtificial neural network (ANNs) is a flexible architecture of all the Artificial Intelligence (AI) frameworks (Kohonen 1988). It has been adopted extensively in the area of water resources engineering for prediction or forecasting of hydrological time series. It operates on the principle of learning from the set of training data. The neural network is normally structured in layers. It involves a set of layers (nodes), namely the input layer (sensory unit), one or more hidden layers (association unit), and an output layer (response unit). The connectionist learning paradigm links the sensory units to the association units through fixed weights, and the association units connected to the response units can have variable weights. An activation function is applied to the weighted sum of the inputs to learn arbitrarily complex transformations. In the current study, tangent-sigmoid and linear transfer functions were utilized as the transfer functions of the hidden and output layers, respectively. Among various algorithms that have been utilized to train the network, the traditional backpropagation (BP) algorithm based on the concept of supervised learning is a popular one which uses gradient descent method to minimize the errors and propagate it in a backward direction to update the weights of hidden layers. The correction to the weights is determined by the magnitude of error together with the number of inputs (Nelson and Wang 1992;Mehrotra et al. 1996). Maier and Dandy (2000) recognized that the ANN model with one hidden layer provides satisfactory degree of freedom in terms of specific weights and bias connections to estimate any function very efficiently. For further detailed information related to ANN architectures, their mathematical formulations, and optimizations, one can refer to Sivanandam and Paulraj (2009);Titterington (2010); Khan (2018).\n\nIn the present study, the back-propagation feed-forward network (BPNN) established by Rumelhart et al. (1986) was used for forecasting of the SPI time series. The ANN toolbox in MATLAB (R2014a) was adopted for establishing ANN models. The SPI 6 and SPI 12 were projected for the lead times of 1 and 6 months. The optimal number of the hidden neuron was chosen by exercising the trial and error process. To select the ideal number of hidden neurons, Wanas et al. (1998) unveiled that, when the quantity of hidden nodes is proportionate to log(T), there comes the finest operation of neural network, where T denotes the number of training samples. It was observed that the number of nodes in the hidden layer fluctuated between two to six, and it was found that 4 hidden neurons were optimal for all grid locations. The gradient descent optimization algorithm with an adaptive learning rate of 0.45, momentum rate of 0.15, and learning cycle of 5000 was assigned to determine the weights and biases of the network. The adaptive learning rate is a hyperparameter which governs the learning step size while configuring the network amidst keeping the learning stable. A better set of weights could be determined in fewer training epochs with the aid of optimal momentum rate. The BPNN model with 3-4-1 architecture (i.e., 3 neurons in the input layer, 4 neurons in a single hidden layer, and 4 neurons in the output layer with connections across layers) was adopted for all the 21 grid locations of Gulbarga. Additionally, to develop the models, the data of the period 1985-2005, about 70% of data were utilized for model training, and the remaining 30% of data, i.e., from the period 2006-2013, was adopted for the model validation. Cortes and Vapnik (1995) researched the support vector machine (SVM) hypothesis, which consists of two components namely the support vector classification (SVC) and support vector regression (SVR). The SVM hypothesis is grounded on the principle of structural risk minimization, whereas the neural networks work on the principle of the empirical risk minimization (Raghavendra. N and Deka 2014). In the present study, SVR is adopted for forecasting of SPI. It functions on the concept of mapping the input data which are usually non-linear and represent them in a highdimensional feature space (Cortes and Vapnik 1995). The linear decision surface is structured through the distinctive  properties, to attain the good generalization of the support vector network. SVM regression employs the loss function to illustrate the divergence of the predicted function of the original form. A variety of loss functions are found in the literature like Huber's, linear, quadratic, and exponential (Huber and Ronchetti 2009). For the present study, loss function based on the Vapnik's \u03b5-insensitive function was adopted for the reason that it penalizes predictions that are outlay than '\u03b5' from the desired output. For describing the feature space of the kernel function, the choice of proper kernel function is essential in SVR. In the present study, kernel function based on Gaussian radial basis function (RBF) was adopted for the reason that the function established noteworthy performance in the SVR community of machine learning. SVM models have virtuous generalization ability in practice, and the risk of model over-fitting is less (Vapnik 1999). The LIBSVM toolbox (Chang and Lin 2011) was adopted for establishing SVR models. LIBSVM offers an interface to the users to connect the individual program effortlessly, and also it backs the multi-class grouping. Similar to ANN modeling procedure, the training and testing schemes are adopted for partitioning of the SPI time series. Tuning the SVR model is extremely significant in view of obtaining optimized parameters for best prediction. The optimization of three SVR parameters, i.e., gamma (\u03b3), cost function (C), and epsilon (\u03b5), was carried out via GRID search.\n\n\nSupport vector regression\n\n\nWavelet packet transform\n\nSimilar to the conventional Fourier transforms (FT), the wavelet transforms (WT) allows to analyze nonlinear and non-stationary time series that contain multiscale features using a completely different merit function. The advantage of WT is that it examines the signal, even if the signal holds discontinuity and sharp spikes (Shinde and Hou 2005). Wavelet packets are improved generalizations of wavelet tree decomposition capable of providing better frequency localization of signals. The wavelet packet transform (WPT) provides extensive decomposition over level by level. The foremost difference between discrete WT and WPT is that the WPT effectively decomposes both the low-pass (approximation coefficients) and high-pass filter (detail coefficients) for the production of high-frequency resolution (Walczak et al. 1996). A 'n' level wavelet packet decomposition produces 2 n different sets of coefficients as opposed to n+1 sets in the Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT). In the DWT, a signal passes through the low-pass filter and the high-pass filter followed by downsampling (keeping only one out of two data points) with both filters. It is typically a non-redundant transformation and so a minimum number of wavelet co-efficient are retained at each decomposition stage. Although this property is very useful in many applications, the non-redundant nature is prone to shift sensitivity and is, therefore, undesirable for forecasting problems (Djerbouai and Souag-Gamane 2016). Therefore, it may not be suitable to apply DWT in SPI forecasting where the valuable information is localized in higher frequency components. Hence, the adoption of WPT achieves the best frequency resolution. WPT enfolds smoothness, orthogonality, and localization properties of their mother wavelets. A recursive algorithm computes the coefficients in the linear combinations crafting each computed sequence of wavelet packet coefficients as the root of its own analysis tree (Walden 2001). There exist several mother wavelets in the literature, viz., Haar, Daubechies, Coiflets, Bior, Symlets, Spline, etc. From the solution of dilation equation, Daubechies (1992) established a mother wavelet family. Daubechies 4 (db4) is one among the mother wavelet utilized in the present study.  \n\n\nModel development\n\nWPT is adopted for pre-processing of the input signals (i.e., the SPI time series). The decomposed coefficients of wavelet packet transform are provided as inputs for the ANN and SVR models to establish the hybrid WP-ANN and WP-SVR models. To obtain WPT coefficients, wavelet analysis and design toolbox of MATLAB (R2014a) were employed. The choice of the suitable mother wavelet for WPT is one of the significant steps. Daubechies 4 (db4) wavelet was utilized as the mother wavelet, due to its large applicability in the field of hydrological studies (Sujay Raghavendra and Deka 2015;Seo et al. 2016). With the selection of the mother wavelet, the provided signal was analyzed for the calculated threshold value of \"SURE\" entropy. The threshold value of \"SURE\" entropy was determined using the formula: Threshold value = 2log e (nlog2(n)) 0.5\n\n. The optimum number of decomposition levels of the WPT was selected from the established relationship, L = int[log(n)] suggested by (Wang and Ding 2003) where, L and n are level of decomposition and length of time-series data (signal), respectively. In the present study, the length of the signal was 340 data points (time series of SPI), and hence, the level of decomposition was chosen as two and three. The data of the period 1985-2005, about 70% of data, were utilized for model training, and the remaining 30% of data, i.e., from the period 2006-2013 were adopted for the model testing. The train and test data series were separately decomposed. The WPT coefficients of both the levels (2 and 3) were verified to discover the optimum level. In machine learning, hybrid models help to improve modeling efficiency by combining multiple models. The artificial neural network and support vector regression are the base-learners, and they are aided with wavelet packet decomposed time-series data as inputs. The advantage of the proposed hybrid methods is their ability to take the advantage of wavelet packet analysis to have an accurate forecast. The hybrid WP-ANN and WP-SVR models established by providing the inputs constructed through the wavelet packet decomposed subseries were trained similar to the conventional standalone ANN and SVR models, respectively. The ANN, SVR, and hybrid WP-ANN and WP-SVR models were implemented for drought forecasting based on the input-output structure as mentioned below:\n\n1 step lead forecast:\nSPI (t\u22122) + SPI (t\u22121) + SPI (t) \u2192 SPI (t+1) 6 step lead forecast: SPI (t\u22122) + SPI (t\u22121) + SPI (t) \u2192 SPI (t+6) .\n\nPerformance statistics\n\nThe forecasting performance of all models for each of 21 grid locations was estimated using the statistical indices like R 2 , RMSE, and MAE. These metrics express the level of certainty of the models. The R 2 quantifies the degree of the linear correlation among the forecasted and observed data. The deviation of the total and absolute error is evaluated through RMSE and MAE indices, respectively.\n\n\nCoefficient of determination (R 2 ):\n\nwhere, 2.

In this study, SPI 6 and SPI 12 were forecasted for all the grid locations, over lead times of 1 and 6 months to determine the applicability of the machine learning techniques and their hybrid forms in drought forecasting over short and longer lead times.\n\n\nSPI 6 forecasts of 1-month and 6-month lead time\n\nThe testing phase performance of both hybrid and standalone machine learning models in forecasting SPI 6 over a 1-month lead time at all the grid locations is presented in Table 2. The statistical measures computed by using the actual versus forecasted SPI values of the individual and hybrid models are comparatively evaluated. The performance of standalone ANN & SVR models were fairly poor with high errors and bias (of low variance). For example, the R 2 of ANN & SVR models were as low as 0.51 and 0.59, respectively at location 3. None of the standalone models provided reliable SPI forecasts even for other locations as evident from error and efficiency statistics tabulated in Table 2. The hybrid WP-ANN models can be ranked at first place based on the comparative performance evaluation with ANN and SVR models irrespective of the location considered. The hybrid WP-SVR model performed relatively equivalent to that of WP-ANN model at several grid locations and showed superior performance for grid locations 3, 7, 17, 19, and 21 while forecasting SPI 6 over a 1-month lead time. The best 1-month lead time WP-ANN forecast of SPI 6 was for location 6 (Central part of the district) which had a performance of R 2 = 0.90, RMSE = 0.26, and MAE = 0.2, and similarly, the WP-SVR model provided superior performance for location 19 which had a performance of R 2 = 0.84, RMSE = 0.34, and MAE = 0.27. The hybrid WP-ANN and WP-SVR models taking the advantage of the wavelet packet co-efficients, generated unbiased estimates with relatively low generalization error to yield superior performance. Figure 3 shows the sample scatterplots of observed versus forecasted SPI 6 of 1-month lead time from the best WP-ANN and WP-SVR models. It could be inferred from the results that ANN and SVR alone were unable to forecast the drought severity properly. The ANN and SVR models were underestimating the peaks. While with the integration of the wavelet packet analysis with ANN and SVR paradigms, the hybrid models were capable to distinctly forecast the drought severity. There was also a considerable increase in R 2 statistic and a considerable decrease in RMSE and MAE values. The forecast performance of both hybrid and standalone machine learning models deteriorated when the lead time was increased from 1 month to 6 months, especially with respect to RMSE statistic. The SPI 6 was forecasted taking a 6-month lead time to determine the applicability of both hybrid and standalone machine learning models in long-term drought forecasting. The test phase performance of ANN, SVR, hybrid WP-ANN, and WP-SVR models in forecasting SPI 6 over a 6-month lead time at all the grid locations is presented in Table 3. The best model for 6-month lead SPI 6 forecast was the WP-ANN model of location 16 with R 2 = 0.85, RMSE = 0.55, and MAE = 0.47. The WP-SVR model of the same location 16 was equally good in forecasting long-term drought. The forecasts from WP-SVR model of location 14 performed relatively superior to that of the WP-ANN model, with R 2 , RMSE, and MAE values being 0.83, 0.52, and 0.43, respectively. Figure 4 shows the scatter plots of observed versus forecasted SPI 6 of 6-month lead time from the best WP-ANN and WP-SVR models. Among 21 locations, the hybrid WP-ANN model performed better at 16 locations, while in the other 5 locations, the hybrid WP-SVR model provided satisfactory forecasts. However, the difference in terms of performance measures/metrics is not so significant.\n\n\nSPI 12 forecasts of 1-month and 6-month lead time\n\nThe testing phase performance of both hybrid and standalone machine learning models in forecasting SPI 12 over a 1-month lead time at all the grid locations is presented in Table 4. In this case too, the performance metrics of standalone ANN and SVR models were fairly poor with high errors and less efficiency. A forecast of SPI 12 over 1-month lead time from all the machine learning models was observed to have better results compared to 1-month lead SPI 6 forecasts in terms of all the performance measures. On comparing the performances of all the developed models in terms of R 2 , RMSE, and MAE statistics, it reveals that both WP-ANN and WP-SVR forecasts showed good agreement with the observed SPIs. It is evident that for all the locations, the R 2 statistic of hybrid models is above 0.83, with the highest being 0.95 for location 6. The metrics of WP-ANN and WP-SVR hybrid models portray relatively similar performances Fig. 9 Drought severity maps based on SPI 12 of 1-month lead forecasting from both the models. For instance, with reference to location 6, the forecasts of WP-ANN model had R 2 = 0.95, RMSE = 0.24, and MAE = 0.17; on the contrary, the forecasts of WP-SVR held R 2 = 0.92, RMSE = 0.3, and MAE = 0.18. Though the difference is very negligible it can be inferred that both the WP-ANN and WP-SVR performed with equal potential. Out of 21 grid locations, the WP-ANN performance was slightly better than that of WP-SVR model at 18 locations. Figure 5 shows the sample scatterplots of observed versus forecasted SPI 12 of 1-month lead time from the best WP-ANN and WP-SVR models.\n\nThe forecast performance of SPI 12 of 6-month lead time held better metrics than SPI 6 of 6-month lead time. The test phase performance of ANN, SVR, hybrid WP-ANN, and WP-SVR models in forecasting SPI 12 over a 6-month lead time at all the grid locations is presented in Table 5. The hybrid WP-ANN model of location 4 was the best model for forecasting SPI 12 of 6-month lead period with the performance metrics R 2 =0.91, RMSE=0.35, and MAE=0.27. Its counterpart, the WP-SVR model too performed well at location 4 with R 2 = 0.85, RMSE = 0.39, and MAE = 0.31. Among 21 locations, the hybrid WP-ANN model performed better at 17 locations, while at the other 4 locations, the hybrid WP-SVR model provided satisfactory forecasts. Figure 6 shows the scatter plots of observed versus forecasted SPI 12 of 6-month lead time from the best WP-ANN and WP-SVR models. The trend of the results obtained while forecasting SPI 12 of 6-month lead period was homologous to the trend obtained for SPI 6 of 6-month lead period. Just like earlier case, the hybrid wavelet packet ANN and SVR models worked better compared to standalone ANN and SVR models. There is not much variability in terms of the performance measures between the WP-ANN and WP-SVR model forecasts. Though WP-ANN performs slightly better, the difference is marginal.\n\n\nThematic maps\n\nBased on the observed and forecasted SPI values from hybrid and standalone machine learning models, drought severity maps for the month of August 2006 were created for the study area. It is to be noted that 2006 was a drought year and the month of August was chosen, since negative SPI values in the monsoon season would reveal drought conditions throughout the year. The thematic maps provide a spatial extent of drought classes all through the district. Inverse Distance Weighting (IDW) was used in this study to generate thematic maps of meteorological drought using SPI data of 21 grid locations. Maps are generated for both SPI 6 and SPI 12 for 1-and 6-month lead times obtained via hybrid and standalone machine learning models. Figure 7 shows the meteorological drought severity maps for August 2006 based on SPI 6 of 1-month lead forecasting. It is quite evident from the map that the Gulbarga district suffered heavy drought in the year 2006. In the observed SPI 6 map, it is seen that majority of the district is reeling under drought. Both the WP-ANN and WP-SVR forecast maps commensurate with the observed map, with WP-ANN slightly better. This again upholds that the hybrid wavelet packet ANN is the best model for forecasting SPI 6 of 1-month lead time. Figure 8 shows the meteorological drought severity maps for August 2006 based on SPI 6 of 6-month lead forecasting. Here, indeed, the whole of the district was under severe-tomoderate drought conditions which is best revealed by the WP-ANN forecast map. Figure 9 shows the meteorological drought severity maps for August 2006 based on SPI 12 of 1-month lead forecasting. Referring to Fig. 9, it could be seen that a major part of the district was under slightly wet condition. Here, again, the WP-ANN and WP-SVR forecast maps commensurate better with the observed map. However, the WP-ANN model is much reliable for forecasting SPI 12 of 1-month lead time. Figure 10 shows the meteorological drought severity maps for August 2006 based on SPI 12 of 6-month lead forecasting. While most part of the district showed moderate drought, the ANN and SVR maps showed slightly wet conditions. Since the forecasting period is 6 months ahead, the accuracy was less. The ANN and SVR maps failed to emulate the observed SPI 12 map. However, the WP-ANN was found to be closely matching with the observed map. For 6-month lead forecasting, the scenario is quite different and complex compared to 1-month lead forecasting.\n\n\nSummary and conclusions\n\nAn early indication of possible drought can help to set out drought mitigation strategies and measures in advance. Therefore, drought forecasting plays an important role in the planning and management of water resource systems and thereby reduces drought-related impacts significantly. This study aimed to determine the most effective machine learning techniques for forecasting droughts in the Gulbarga district of Karnataka. The SPI was used due to its advantages over other drought indices and because of its ease for calculation at different time scales. SPI for 6 months and 12 months were calculated and then forecasted using ANN, SVR, hybrid WP-ANN, and WP-SVR models for a lead time of 1 and 6 months.\n\nThe WP-ANN models were found to be the most effective for forecasting SPI 6 and SPI 12 in most of the locations. WP-ANN models consistently showed lower values of RMSE and MAE compared to the other models explored in this study. In general, for SPI 12 all models were found to provide comparatively satisfactory forecasts at 1-month and 6-month lead time compared to SPI 6. This is because SPI 12 is the normalization of rainfall over the last 12 months, and as a result, it is not as sensitive to changes in precipitation from one month to next as it is in the case of SPI 6. Forecast results deteriorated as the forecast lead time increased from 1 to 6 months. The wavelet packet pre-processing of SPI time series aids in improving the model performance many folds by capturing helpful information on various resolution levels. For example, at location 6, while forecasting SPI 6 of 1-month lead time, the R 2 increased from 0.65 for ANN to 0.9 for WP-ANN, with an increase of 38.46%, which is very significant. The pre-processing of SPI time series using WPT enhanced the performance of both ANN as well as SVR models. The performance of WP-ANN outperformed the performance of WP-SVR in most of the cases.\n\nFig. 2\n2Selected grid stations for generation of SPI within Gulbarga district of Karnataka\n\nFig. 3\n3Sample\n\nFig. 4\n4Sample\n\nFig. 5\n5Sample\n\n\nMean Absolute Error (MAE):\n\nFig. 6 Fig. 7 of 1\n671Sample Drought severity maps based on SPI 6\n\nFig. 8\n8Drought severity maps based on SPI 6 of 6-month lead forecasting\n\nFig. 10\n10Drought severity maps based on SPI 12 of 6\n\nTable 1\n1Classification of drought based on SPI valuesSPI values \nClass \n\n< (\u2212 2) \nExtreme drought \n\u2212 1.5 to \u2212 1.99 \nSevere drought \n\u2212 1.0 to \u22121.49 \nModerate drought \n0 to \u2212 0.99 \nMild drought \n0 to + 0.99 \nSlightly wet \n+ 1 to + 1.49 \n\n\nTable 2\n2Model performance metrics pertaining to SPI 6 forecast for 1-month lead timeBold numerical values represent the performance indices of best model \n\n\nTable 3\n3Model performance metrics pertaining to SPI 6 forecast for 6-month lead timeBold numerical values represent the performance indices of best model \n\n\nTable 4\n4Model performance metrics pertaining to SPI 12 forecast for 1-month lead timeBold numerical values represent the performance indices of best modelGRID \nloca-\ntion \n\nStatistic \n\nModels \n\nGRID location Statistic Models \n\nGRID location Statistic Models \n\nANN WP-ANN SVR WP-SVR \n\nANN WP-ANN SVR WP-SVR \n\nANN WP-ANN SVR WP-SVR \n\n1 \n\nR 2 \n\n0.89 \n\n0.93 \n\n0.87 0.9 \n\n8 \n\nR 2 \n\n0.86 \n\n0.93 \n\n0.83 0.91 \n\n15 \n\nR 2 \n\n0.79 0.86 \n\n0.86 \n\n0.93 \n\nRMSE 0.41 \n\n0.29 \n\n0.42 0.38 \n\nRMSE 0.45 \n\n0.31 \n\n0.48 0.34 \n\nRMSE 0.27 0.21 \n\n0.35 \n\n0.24 \n\nMAE \n\n0.32 \n\n0.23 \n\n0.3 \n\n0.28 \n\nMAE \n\n0.32 \n\n0.22 \n\n0.32 0.24 \n\nMAE \n0.18 0.15 \n\n0.23 \n\n0.17 \n\n2 \n\nR 2 \n\n0.83 \n\n0.94 \n\n0.83 0.93 \n\n9 \n\nR 2 \n\n0.83 \n\n0.9 \n\n0.81 0.89 \n\n16 \n\nR 2 \n\n0.85 \n\n0.94 \n\n0.89 0.92 \n\nRMSE 0.38 \n\n0.22 \n\n38 \n\n0.23 \n\nRMSE 0.41 \n\n0.31 \n\n0.43 0.32 \n\nRMSE 0.38 \n\n0.24 \n\n0.33 0.27 \n\nMAE \n\n0.26 \n\n0.17 \n\n0.27 0.17 \n\nMAE \n\n0.27 \n\n0.23 \n\n0.28 0.24 \n\nMAE \n\n0.27 \n\n0.18 \n\n0.22 0.21 \n\n3 \n\nR 2 \n\n0.77 \n\n0.88 \n\n0.75 0.85 \n\n10 \n\nR 2 \n\n0.84 0.92 \n\n0.83 \n\n0.92 \n\n17 \n\nR 2 \n\n0.85 \n\n0.92 \n\n0.8 \n\n0.9 \n\nRMSE 0.37 \n\n0.26 \n\n0.39 0.29 \n\nRMSE 0.47 0.2 \n\n0.29 \n\n0.19 \n\nRMSE 0.35 \n\n0.25 \n\n0.42 0.29 \n\nMAE \n\n0.26 \n\n0.18 \n\n0.28 0.24 \n\nMAE \n0.38 0.14 \n\n0.19 \n\n0.14 \n\nMAE \n\n0.23 \n\n0.18 \n\n0.26 0.19 \n\n4 \n\nR 2 \n\n0.81 \n\n0.93 \n\n0.86 0.92 \n\n11 \n\nR 2 \n\n0.77 \n\n0.9 \n\n0.76 0.83 \n\n18 \n\nR 2 \n\n0.79 \n\n0.86 \n\n0.74 0.83 \n\nRMSE 0.53 \n\n0.32 \n\n0.45 0.34 \n\nRMSE 0.37 \n\n0.25 \n\n0.46 0.38 \n\nRMSE 0.27 \n\n0.21 \n\n0.32 0.24 \n\nMAE \n\n0.35 \n\n0.25 \n\n0.3 \n\n0.25 \n\nMAE \n\n0.26 \n\n0.18 \n\n0.31 0.26 \n\nMAE \n\n0.18 \n\n0.15 \n\n0.21 0.17 \n\n5 \n\nR 2 \n\n0.83 \n\n0.9 \n\n0.82 0.87 \n\n12 \n\nR 2 \n\n0.84 \n\n0.88 \n\n0.82 0.87 \n\n19 \n\nR 2 \n\n0.86 \n\n0.95 \n\n0.85 0.94 \n\nRMSE 0.4 \n\n0.32 \n\n0.42 0.37 \n\nRMSE 0.28 \n\n0.25 \n\n0.3 \n\n0.26 \n\nRMSE 0.33 \n\n0.19 \n\n0.33 0.21 \n\nMAE \n\n0.27 \n\n0.25 \n\n0.27 0.29 \n\nMAE \n\n0.2 \n\n0.2 \n\n0.21 0.17 \n\nMAE \n\n0.23 \n\n0.14 \n\n0.22 0.15 \n\n6 \n\nR 2 \n\n0.88 \n\n0.95 \n\n0.83 0.92 \n\n13 \n\nR 2 \n\n0.8 \n\n0.89 \n\n0.78 \n\n0.9 \n\n20 \n\nR 2 \n\n0.84 0.89 \n\n0.85 \n\n0.93 \n\nRMSE 0.36 \n\n0.24 \n\n0.42 0.3 \n\nRMSE 0.29 0.19 \n\n0.28 \n\n0.18 \n\nRMSE 0.36 0.29 \n\n0.35 \n\n0.24 \n\nMAE \n\n0.23 \n\n0.17 \n\n0.25 0.18 \n\nMAE \n\n0.2 \n\n0.13 \n\n0.18 \n\n0.13 \n\nMAE \n0.23 0.2 \n\n0.22 \n\n0.18 \n\n7 \n\nR 2 \n\n0.85 \n\n0.9 \n\n0.79 0.88 \n\n14 \n\nR 2 \n\n0.88 \n\n0.94 \n\n0.85 0.92 \n\n21 \n\nR 2 \n\n0.84 \n\n0.91 \n\n0.81 0.9 \n\nRMSE 0.38 \n\n0.27 \n\n0.43 0.31 \n\nRMSE 0.41 \n\n0.29 \n\n0.46 0.31 \n\nRMSE 0.31 \n\n0.27 \n\n0.34 0.27 \n\nMAE \n\n0.28 \n\n0.21 \n\n0.32 0.23 \n\nMAE \n\n0.28 \n\n0.23 \n\n0.35 0.24 \n\nMAE \n\n0.24 \n\n0.2 \n\n0.26 0.21 \n\nAcknowledgementsThe authors would like to thank the Indian Meteorological Department, Pune, for providing the necessary data required for research and the Department of Applied Mechanics & Hydraulics, National Institute of Technology Karnataka for the necessary infrastructural support.\nThe palmer drought severity index: limitations and assumptions.
