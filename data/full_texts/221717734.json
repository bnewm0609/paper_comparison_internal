INTRODUCTION\n\nRecent incidents in cyberspace prove that Advanced Persistent Threats (APT) has become the most common attack against public and private organizations, such as finance, energy, government and so on. The adversaries behind these attacks usually take long time to collect information about their targets. Once they gain entry into the internal network of target systems, malwares with new signatures and carefully movement will be adopted to hide intrusion track as much as possible, thereby persisting in the network for longer periods. According to the 2019 FireEye M-trends report [1], 56% of users were attacked by the same or similar hacking groups at least once in 2017, and in 2018 the number had increased to 64%.\n\nIn order to search evidence of adversary activities and adjust development of defense tools, security researchers need more detailed information about the attack. In this case, it is essential for them to cooperate with each other and exchange all information. Security researchers proposed threat intelligence to promote information sharing, and a number of threat intelligence models are constructed to suit different organizational processes and modeling goals. These models have structured and strict standards to characterize each aspect of the adversary, which are helpful to improve operational efficiency while analyzing attack and adjusting deployment of security softwares. Based on these models, security experts improved efficiency while handling data, and quickly associate finding evidence with historical information to restore the process of attack events and identify the hacking group behind these attacks. The associated data includes infrastructures, malwares, tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs), etc. Although there has been a great improvement in restoring a detailed hacking process, few works have been done to analyze the characteristics of adversaries in multiple dimensions, such as similarity measure between APT groups, prediction about next move, even the thinking model and preferences of APT groups. However, it is important for researches to know the habits, the capabilities and the thinking way of APT groups. Matt Berninger, a FireEye security analyst, has used a document clustering approach to analyze the similarity between apt groups in 2019 [2]. However, this work focused on the data level similarity analysis, ignoring the semantic links between different items in threat intelligence.\n\nThe concepts of meta-paths are proposed by Sun to systematically capture numerous semantic relationships across multiple types of objects in Heterogeneous Information Networks [3], such as bibliographic networks, knowledge networks, co-citation network and so on. In a heterogeneous information network, two objects are similar if they are connected by a semantic path. For example, if two apt groups both use the same TTP and the same software, we can assume that the two groups have some similarities, the more TTP and software they use in common, the higher the degree of similarity. It's obvious that the similarity in behavior comes from the similarity in their thinking and doing habits, which provides us the motivation to cluster closer groups into one community. Moreover, the more information of adversary activities we identify, the higher the accuracy of clustering.\n\nOur study differs from previous research in the following three aspects. First, we focus on the statistical characteristics of apt group, and propose a three-layer model to discuss how to use these threat intelligence items. Second, we introduce a similarity measure approach to quantify similarity degree between apt groups' behaviors. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to analyze apt group's similarity at the semantic level. Third, we use Girvan-Newman [27] algorithm to find community structure, experimental results show that there is a distinct community structure from the similarity network.\n\n\nII. RELATED WORK\n\n\nA. Sharing Standards in Cyber Threat Intelligence\n\nIt is difficult to obtain effective analysis conclusion from isolated security event analysis, so threat information sharing is crucial. In order to achieve a unified understanding, some standards are proposed for information exchange.\n\nSTIX\u2122 (the Structured Threat Information Expression) is a structured language for capturing and sharing cyber threat information [4]. STIX provides a method to describe the details and contents of Threat Intelligence, including cyber observables, indicators, incidents, adversary TTPs and so on. Based on STIX, security researchers can analyze cyber threats, specify indicator patterns for cyber threat, manage cyber threat prevention and response activities, and share cyber threat information [7]. Due to its flexible and extensible characteristics, it has emerged as a consensus, and has been applied in many cyber frameworks.\n\nPRE-ATT&CK (Adversarial Tactics, Techniques & Common Knowledge for Left-of-Exploit) proposed by MITRE Corporation, which is a classification and description standard of adversary activities in the early stages of cyber attack lifecycle [5]. Another standard proposed by MITRE Corporation is Adversarial Tactics, Techniques, and Common Knowledge (ATT&CK) [6], which describes the adversary behavior after initial access. PRE-ATT&CK and ATT&CK are more detailed descriptions than cyber kill chain, defining the stage of attack, techniques and software, and represents them with unique string which can be associated with other standards such as CAPEC [8], CVE [9] and CWE [10] etc.\n\n\nB. Cyber Threat Framework\n\nSharing standards describe threat related items, but due to the different context and purpose, applications are different. For Improving Critical Infrastructure Cybersecurity National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) published Cybersecurity Framework(CSF) in February, 2014 [11] and updated in April, 2018 [12], which defines a highlevel approach for analysis from an infrastructure risk management perspective. the Framework Core is organized into five core functions: Identify, Protect, Detect, Respond, Recover. Functions are further divided into twenty-one categories and over a hundred subcategories, and provide context to every category with reference to other frameworks. In addition, the CSF framework defines four levels of risk management: Partial, Risk-Informed, Repeatable, Adaptable. The framework provides public and private organizations with benchmark to improve risk management while take their operations.\n\nTo support the sharing of threat information, the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI) published its Cyber Threat Framework (CTF) in March 2017 [13]. The CTF framework provides a common structure which contains four components: Stages, Objectives, Actions, Indicators. In March 2018, the National Security Agency integrates the ODNI CTF with ATT&CK, and released \"\"NSA/CSS Technical Cyber Threat Framework v2\" report [14], which \"provides a baseline of standard definitions to discuss adversary activities throughout the adversary lifecycle\".\n\nThe framework mentioned above focus on describing adversary lifecycle, Vasileios Mavroeidis proposed The Cyber Threat Intelligence Model (CTI) to help cyber defenders understand their position against ever-changing threats [15]. Unlike the hierarchical model proposed by Ryan Stillions [16], the CTI model provides a way to describe what kinds of data are needed to analyze potential attack attribution, and help assessing security more efficiency.\n\n\nC. Similarity Measure Algorithms\n\nSimilarity measure in an information network refers to finding top k objects that are the most similar to a given object. According to the different connection relations between objects, information networks can be divided into heterogeneous information network and homogeneous information networks, the number of types in the former network equal to one, and the latter is greater than one.\n\nSimilarity search algorithms in information networks can be roughly divided into two categories: feature-based methods and link-based methods. Feature-based measurement method uses the feature attribute value of the object to measure the similarity, such as cosine similarity [17], Euclidean distance [18], Jaccard coefficient, etc. FireEye' researcher has used the method of cosine similarity to calculate the similarity between apt groups in March 2019 [2]. However, this method does not consider the semantic meanings between objects, and cannot meet the similarity search requirements of network data. G. Jeh, etc. [19][20] investigated symmetric similarity measurement and asymmetric similarity measurement, but these methods do not consider the difference of links between objects, so it cannot be applied to heterogeneous information networks.\n\nIn 2011, Sun et al. [21] proposed PathSim (Meta Path-Based Similarity) approach to solve the similarity search problem in heterogeneous information networks, the author analyzed the semantic meanings between objects, then realize similarity measurement between objects of the same type. Lao et al. [22] proposed a restricted path random walk algorithm PCRW (Path-Constrained Random Walks) to perform similarity search on a directed graph constructed from rich data. Although there is a number of works which have researched the similarity of attacks from specific attack actions, few works have been studied with the behavior patterns, thinking habits and tendencies of an APT group, which is a different perspective for the analysis of threat intelligence.\n\n\nIII. METHODOLOGY\n\nThis section discusses the leverage of threat intelligence items at different levels first. Then, a knowledge network with different semantic meanings between objects was constructed. Based on the knowledge network, we use a similarity measure algorithm to calculate similarity by counting meta-paths of two groups in heterogeneous information network. Finally, a clustering algorithm named Girvan-Newman is applied into finding community groups.\n\n\nA. The Three-layer Model for Statistical Analysis Goal, Behavior and Capability\n\nSince there are many models and frameworks defined to describe related threat items, the main purpose of these models and frameworks is to share information, helping security analysts hunting threats, continuous monitoring abnormal activities, and adjusting its security policies and tools. However, with the accumulating data of threat intelligence, we need to analyze APT groups from a statistical perspective. In this work, a three-layer model is proposed to analyze the multi-level characteristics of attack organizations, including Goal, Behavior, and Capability. Goal: The Goal of an APT Group is dynamic from a statistical point of view. An APT group may have different types of targets in publicly reports, there are some reasons behind to drive them to launch an attack. These organizations are usually well-funded, with multiple people working for the same goal. The goals motivating cyber-attacks can be divided into Cultural, Social, Economic, and Political [23]. Take Cobalt Group as an example, the group aims to steal money via targeting ATM systems, payment systems and SWIFT systems, and its targets are mainly in Europe and Asia, so this group want to take economic benefits.\n\nBehavior: The Behavior reflects activities taken by an APT group after its target is determined. Elements of the behavior-layer include TTP and software. When attackers are penetrating into their target systems, the decisions are different. Since people have certain or potential habits, every group may choose different TTP and tools even performing the same task. Therefore, behaviors usually reflect the preferences of an APT group.\n\nCapability: The Capability includes exploiting and creating vulnerabilities, obfuscation and encryption, removing evidences, infrastructure and so on. The capability can reflect the threat level of a hacking group. With accumulated threat intelligence, security analysts can determine whether this group has a national background or a mature architecture guiding them to penetrate through their capabilities.\n\nThe three-layer model mentioned above can be correlated with existing models, such as STIX, ATT&CK. When sharing threat intelligence through STIX, the number of data items at different levels will vary greatly, the number of data in goallevel is one or two orders of magnitude, and three orders of magnitude in behavior-level, and four or five orders of magnitude in capability-level. If these different levels of data are put together, unnecessary processing trouble will be bought during deeper analysis. The characteristics of these levels are also different, goals represent targets which group is interested in, and behavior reflects the preferences of an APT group, and capability represent the comprehensive level of the group. As the data increases, researchers can also expand from the analysis of single threat event to a long-term portrait of APT groups.\n\n\nB. Similarity Search at Behavior Level\n\nThe behavior-layer represents the habits and preferences of an APT group. Some groups are good at constructing welldesigned content to perform spear-phishing attacks, and some groups get used to finding vulnerabilities in web applications. After entering into the internal network, the softwares they use are also different. Although the behavior of the attack is related to the target, it can also reflect its potential tendency. An APT group can't master all TTPs and softwares, there must be differences and similarities between different groups.\n\nIn order to analyze similarity between APT groups, a knowledge network at behavior level should be constructed at first. The knowledge network is a common heterogeneous information network with different semantic meanings between objects. In the process of attacking targets, on the one hand, attackers need to decide their process, on the other hand, they need to choose attack tools to complete specific operations, so the semantic relationship between Group and TTP and between Group and Software are both \"use\". With the integration of attack tools, a software can perform multiple functions, so the semantic relationship between Software and TTP is \"contain\". The schema of the knowledge network is as follows. According to the defining of meta path [24], two objects can be connected with a semantic path, different meta-paths represent different semantics. For example, the link between two APT groups may follow the \"Group-TTP-Group\" path, \"Group-Software-Group\" and so on. There are four different meta paths that exist in the knowledge network, are named as \"GTG\", \"GSG\", \"GSTG\", \"GSTSG\". There are three ways to collect path instances: path count, random walk, and pairwise random walk. Considering that there are only four types of meta-paths, path count method is used to count the total path instance in this paper. Each calculation method of meta paths is given as: \nb b c c c c b b c c c c b b b b u u u u \u00a7 \u00b7 \u00a7 \u00b7 \u00a7 \u00b7\u00b8\u00a8\u00b8\u00a8\u00b8 u \u00fc\u00b8\u00a8\u00b8\u00a8\u00a9 \u00b9 \u00a9 \u00b9 \u00a9 \u00b9 \u00a7 \u00b7u\u00a8\u00a9 \u00b9 P K K K M O M M O M M O M L L L K M O M L\nwhere m is the number of groups ^\u00ec G , n is the number of TTPs ^j T , k is the number of tools ^l S .\n\nFinally, we normalize the matrix and weight these matrixes. The result is stored in a 94\u00d794 matrix,\n1 2 3 4 D E J O P P P P P , where D , E , J , O are the weight of 1 P , 2 P , 3 P , 4 P respectively.\n\nC. Clustering\n\nTherefore, it is almost impossible to determine the number of communities first, we need to discover the community structure step by step. Different from other community algorithms, such as K-L(Kernighan Lin) algorithm [26], the community size needs to be specified; Spectral Dichotomy algorithm [27] can only the community into two, Girvan-Newman algorithm can find the exact number of communities through continuous fitting. Detailed steps of GN (Girvan Newman) algorithm are shown as follows:\n\n(1) Calculate the betweenness centrality of all sides in the network;\n\n(2) Remove the side with the highest betweenness centrality;\n\n(3) Recalculate the betweenness centrality of all edges in the network after edge removal;\n\n(4) Skip to step 2 and recalculate until no edge exists in the network.\n\nAfter applying the GN algorithm, the connected component in the final remaining network are communities.\n\n\nIV. EXPERIMENT AND ANALYSIS\n\nIn this section, a knowledge network at behavior level is constructed by collecting MITRE ATT&CK data, then similarities between APT groups are calculated based on meta-paths, the potential community are discovered based on the similarity result.\n\n\nA. Dataset and Data Setup\n\nTo verify the proposed method, we collect the data from [24], this web page provides a index of APT groups currently found, and give a detailed description, including a brief introduction, associated group descriptions, techniques used, software and reference. In order to analysis similarity, we construct a knowledge network of behavior level based on the collected data at first, including 94 Groups, 239 TTPs, and 271 Software. The knowledge network formed is shown in Figure  4.\n\nAs shown in Figure 4, the concept of Group, TTP, Software are linked by the roles use and contain. On the left of figure 5, there are six instances of meta path \"Group->TTP<-Group\", this means these four ATP groups have used \"Template Injection\" in their attacks. Instances of meta path \"Group->Software<-Group\" is shown on the right of figure 5, since \"Mimikatz\" is a very common hacking tool, many apt organizations will use it to quickly obtain accounts, passwords, etc. After the instances are stored, the SPRSQL language is used to query the correspondence between stored instances, and find the count of meta-paths in the knowledge network. According to the similarity measure, our study needs to query three types of relationships, and brings it into matrixes, the count number is shown in the Table I.   TABLE I. THE SEMANTIC RELATIONSHIPS\n\n\nSemantic relationships Total number\n\nGroup use TTP 1342\n\nGroup use Software 478\n\nSoftware contain TTP 2539\n\nIn the process of data statistics, since there are no G0042 and G0057 in [24], the number of APT groups is 94, and other APT groups are stored sequentially. The corresponding relationship between indexes and Group identities is shown in Table II. \n\n\nB. Result and Analysis\n\nDue to the limitation of data, some types of meta-paths actually don't exist. For example, group \"G0012\" does not have \"software\" items, so the number of meta-paths GSG, GSTG, GSTSG is zero. Therefore, these situations need to be considered when assigning weights. In the calculation process, different weight assignments need to be based on expert experience. We performed several different sets of experimental assignments to try to find the structure in the community classification. The weights are shown in the Table  III.   TABLE III. THE ASSIGNED WEIGHTS By setting different weights, we bring the calculation results of similarity to Girvan-Newman algorithm, the resolution degree considered in our analysis was defined as 1.0. As evident from the figure 6, the GN algorithm divides groups into three categories, and the clustering results have shown the community structure does exist and very robust. Except in the second round, G0016 was divided into the second community, and the results of other rounds were the same as shown in Table IV. This also proves that analyzing attacker behaviors can indeed help to analyze the attacker's habits and preferences. Because of the small amount of data, it is difficult to divide the community accurately, but we can find some potential connections. For example, there are three APT groups using the tool \"SDelete\", two of them are suspected to be attributed to the Russian. The main reason is that there are some differences between different regions APT groups in usage habits. With the accumulation of threat intelligence, more relevance between these groups maybe come out. \n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\n\nSimilarity measure has been widely studied in logical networks to associate different typed relationships between different typed objects, such as bibliographic networks, social media networks, and the knowledge network. Our research focuses on analyzing the similarity between adversary behaviors, and cluster the attackers by finding these connections. The similarity analysis of the attacker's behavior is helpful to understand the attacker's habits. Further researches can be carried out on this basis in the later research. As attack events has time effect, we can also add time dimension to analyze the attackers' thinking mode and potential connections between attackers, which helps the security team to deal with the threat quickly and restore the whole picture of the attack.\n\nFigure 1 .\n1the Three-layer Model for Statistical Analysis\n\nFigure 2 .\n2the schema of the knowledge graph\n\nFigure 3 .\n3Meta Path of behavior level\n\nFigure 4 .Figure 5 .\n45Part of the knowledge network Instances of Meta Paths\n\nFigure 6 .\n6Community Structures.\n\nTABLE II .\nIITHE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN INDEXES AND APT GROUPSIndexes \n1-41 \n42-55 \n56-94 \n\nAPT groups \n1-41 \n43-56 \n58-96 \n\n\n\nTABLE IV .\nIVTHE CLUSTERING RESULTSRound \nclass_0 \nclass_1 \nclass_2 \n\n1 \n3,25 \n\n\n.
