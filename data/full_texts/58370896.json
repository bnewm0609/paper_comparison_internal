And for some items to receive higher ratings than others -Some products are widely perceived as better(or worse) than others ! Its unwise to explain the full rating value in this form ! We should identify the user and item bias Latent Factor Method Matrix Factorization Methods\n\n\nAdding Biases\n\nFor example: ! Suppose we want to estimate user john's rating of the movie Titanic ! And the average rating over all movies is 3.7 stars ! Titanic is better than an average movie, so it tends to be rated 0.5 starts above the average movie ! John is a critical user, who tends to rate 0.3 stars lower than the average ! Thus, the estimate for Titanic's rating by John would be (3.7+0.5-0.3) Latent Factor Method Matrix Factorization Methods\n\n\nAdditional Input Sources\n\nA system must deal with cold start problem, wherein many users supply very few ratings ! We need to incorporate additional sources to relieve this problem ! Using implicit feedback to gain insight into user preferences ! Eg: Demographics, such as gender, age group, zip code, income level.\n\n-!\nitems and users by vectors of factors inferred from item rating patternsRely on matrix types of input data ! One dimension representing user ! The other representing items Two data types ! High-quality explicit feedback \u00a7\uf0a7Includes explicit input by users regarding their interest in products \u00a7\uf0a7We refer to explicit user feedback as ratings \u00a7\uf0a7Usually sparse matrix, since any single user is likely to have rated only a small percentage of reflects option by observing user behavior \u00a7\uf0a7Purchase history, browsing history, search patterns, mouse movements -Usually denotes the presence or absence of an event Typically High portion of missing values caused by sparseness in the useritem rating matrix\n! What makes these techniques even more convenient is that models can integrate naturally many crucial aspects of the data, such as multiple forms of feedback, temporal dynamics, and confidence levels.\nTemporal DynamicsTime-drifting nature ! So far, the presented models have been static ! In reality, product perception and popularity constantly change as new selections emerge ! Similarly, customer's inclinations evolve, leading them to redefine their tasteInputs With Varying Confidence Levels! Are all observed ratings deserve the same weight or confidence?-For example, massive advertising might influence votes for certain items, which do not aptly reflect longer-term characteristics ! The user might be unaware of the existence of the item, or unable to consume it due to its price -Consuming an item can also be the result of factors different from preferring it \u00a7\uf0a7a user may watch a TV show just because he/she is staying on the channel of the previously watched show \u00a7\uf0a7a consumer may buy an item as gift for someone else, despite not liking the item for himself", "annotations": {"author": "[{\"end\":94,\"start\":59},{\"end\":132,\"start\":95},{\"end\":167,\"start\":133},{\"end\":205,\"start\":168}]", "publisher": null, "author_last_name": "[{\"end\":71,\"start\":66},{\"end\":109,\"start\":101},{\"end\":144,\"start\":140},{\"end\":182,\"start\":174}]", "author_first_name": "[{\"end\":65,\"start\":59},{\"end\":100,\"start\":95},{\"end\":139,\"start\":133},{\"end\":173,\"start\":168}]", "author_affiliation": "[{\"end\":93,\"start\":73},{\"end\":131,\"start\":111},{\"end\":166,\"start\":146},{\"end\":204,\"start\":184}]", "title": "[{\"end\":56,\"start\":1},{\"end\":261,\"start\":206}]", "venue": null, "abstract": null, "bib_ref": null, "figure": "[{\"attributes\":{\"id\":\"fig_0\"},\"end\":2159,\"start\":1459}]", "paragraph": "[{\"end\":683,\"start\":280},{\"end\":1140,\"start\":701},{\"end\":1458,\"start\":1169}]", "formula": null, "table_ref": null, "section_header": "[{\"attributes\":{\"n\":\"1.\"},\"end\":278,\"start\":265},{\"end\":699,\"start\":686},{\"attributes\":{\"n\":\"2.\"},\"end\":1167,\"start\":1143},{\"end\":1462,\"start\":1460}]", "table": null, "figure_caption": "[{\"end\":2159,\"start\":1463}]", "figure_ref": null, "bib_author_first_name": null, "bib_author_last_name": null, "bib_entry": null, "bib_title": null, "bib_author": null, "bib_venue": null}}}, "year": 2023, "month": 12, "day": 17}
