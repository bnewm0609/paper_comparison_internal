It has been shown to cause a variety of lesions in DNA#, including pyrimidine dimers of the cyclobutane type and other nucleic acid base photoproducts (Tyrrell, 1973;Brash and Haseltine, 1982;Bose et al., 1983), single-strand breaks (Rosenstein and Ducore, 1983), and DNA-protein cross links (Peak et al., 1984a). The shorter-wavelength UV radiation of the solar spectrum (220-290 nm) is effectively blocked by the ozone in the stratosphere and is therefore of less importance to human exposure than is mid-and near-UV radiation'' (290-405 nm). Cellular damage in the near-UV region is strongly dependent upon the presence of oxygen, indicating a sensitized indirect, photodynamic type of action involving reactive oxygen species (Webb and Brown, 1979;Peak et al., 1983). In contrast, far-UV radiation is thought to induce most deleterious effects as a result of the direct absorption of photons by DNA (Peak and Peak, 1983;Peak el al., 1984~). IIFar-UV radiation, energy < 290 nm; mid-UV radiation, 290-320 nm; near-UV radiation, > 320 nm.\n\nIn photosensitized reactions, the energy present in the photons of near-UV radiation is not transferred directly to ground-state molecular oxygen, which does not absorb radiation in this region; rather the energy is absorbed by an intermediate primary chromophore, the photosensitizer, which in turn activates ground-state molecular oxygen. The actual reactive species of oxygen and the mechanisms whereby they are produced by near-UV radiation remain enigmatic. Known photosensitizers for near-UV radiation include porphyrins, flavins and quinones (Jagger, 1983). Other sensitizers, including reduced coenzyme I (NADH), which enhance DNA breakage caused by 334 nm radiation, were described by Peak et al. (1984~). In the present study we demonstrate that monochromatic UV radiation from 290 to 405 nm can excite the ubiquitous cellular pyridine nicotinamide cofactors NADH and NADPH by photosensitization, resulting in the formation of the toxic oxygen metabolite 0; from ground-state molecular oxygen.\n\n\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\n\nCytochrome c type 111 (horse heart) and NADH and NADPH (enzymatically reduced) were purchased from Sigma Chemical Co., St. Louis, MO. Copper-zinc superoxide dismutase (SOD) from bovine liver (3700 U/mg protein) was a gift of Diagnostic Data, Inc., Mountain View, CA.\n\nSolutions of 0.05 mM cytochrome c with or without 2 mM NADH or NADPH and 50 pg/mZ SOD in phosphate buffered saline (pH 7.4) were irradiated in quartz cuvettes with isolated monochromatic high pressure Hg+ lines (25\u00b0C) from a 2.5 kW Hg-Xe lamp (Hanovia) in combination with a quartz predispersion prism and a 500-mm Bausch and Lomb grating monochromator. The following filters were used to eliminate scattered light at shorter wavelengths (Webb and Peak, 1981): Corning band pass 2900,290 nm; Corning 7-51,334 nm; Corning 0-52 ground 125 to half thickness, 365 nm; Optics Technology LP400, 405 nm. The fluence rates used were 5.5 (290 nrn), 130 (334 nm), 700 (365 nm), and 300 (405 nm) W m-' as measured at the position of the center of the cuvette with a YSI-Kettering model 65A radiometer (Yellow Springs Instrument Co., Yellow Springs, OH). Aerobic solutions were stirred with a stream of humidified air bubbles; anaerobic solutions were bubbled for 15 rnin prior to irradiation with nitrogen at 960 mm Hg pressure that had been passed over copper ribbon heated to 500\u00b0C and through a column of anoxic distilled water for humidification.\n\nThe molar quantity of 0; formed by irradiation was calculated from the reduction of cytochrome c as measured by its absorbance at 550 nm relative to a nonirradiated solution of cytochrome c (McCord and Fridovich, 1969) with a Beckman spectrophotometer UV 5260 and an extinction coefficient for reduced cytochrome c of AEsso = 21 x lo3 M-' cm-' (Johnston, 1984). Quantum yields were calculated by using only the SOD-inhibitable reduction of cytochrome c using the extinction coefficients for the solutions under the experimental conditions, the Beer-Lambert law and the formula: nm) of NADH and NADPH, respectively, with or without added SOD. For NADH, at a dose of 5 kJ m-' approximately 0.5 nmol 0; is produced, as calculated by cytochrome c reduction. The addition of SOD prior to irradiation decreases the amount of reduced cytochrome c by 85%. The demonstration that SOD decreases the reduction of cytochrome cis evidence that this reduction of cytochrome c is mediated by 0;. Likewise, data for cytochrome c reduction in the presence and absence of SOD by 334, 365, and 405 nm UV radiation for NADH and NADPH are presented in Fig. lb,f; c,g; and d,h respectively. Values obtained for 0; production (SOD-inhibitable cytochrome c reduction) at the four wavelengths used are presented in Table 1. In control experiments, no 0, formation was observed when these solutions were irradiated at these wavelengths under strict anaerobic conditions or in the absence of NADH or NADPH (data not shown).\n\nSimilarly, heat-inactivated ( 9 0 T for 5 min) SOD or catalase had no effect on the reduction of cytochrome c caused by radiation. Quantum yields were calculated for the efficiency of 0 2 production as a function of the amount of incident UV radiation. Yields were low with both farand near-UV radiation ( Table 1). The most efficient wavelength for production of 0; is 290 nm, at which 4.0 X lo-* and 2.1 x lo-' 0; molecules per photon were produced with NADH and NADPH, respectively. *Quantum yields are expressed as number of molecular superoxide anions produced per photon irradiation.\n\n\nDISCUSSION\n\nThe cytotoxic and mutagenic effects of far-UV radiation are thought to be largely due to pyrimidine dimer formation resulting from the direct absorption of photons by DNA (Rothman and Setlow, 1979). This direct action on DNA apparently requires no chromophores other than the DNA and does not involve active oxygen species. On the other hand, near-UV radiation is not appreciably absorbed by DNA (Sutherland and Griffin, 1980), and it produces no direct action on DNA. However, it has been demonstrated that near-UV is capable of producing toxicity, which was potentiated in the presence of oxygen (Webb and Brown, 1979;Peak et al., 1983). Oxygen has long been known to participate in the toxic effects of near-UV radiation (Tyrrell, 1976). Bacterial killing can be enhanced up to 16-fold in the presence of oxygen in contrast to the absence of oxygen (Webb and Brown, 1979). The mechanisms that produce this oxygen effect of near-UV radiation are not well understood but are thought to involve the production of one or more reactive oxygen intermediates such as OF, ' 0 2 , or OH. (Peak et al., 1981(Peak et al., , 1982. The data in this report describe the production of one of these reactive species, O;, as a result of a one-electron transfer from photosensitized NADH and NADPH to ground-state molecular oxygen, a process similar to photochemical reactions involving porphyrins (Jagger, 1983). Our results imply that 0; produced via a UV-photosensitization reaction with intracellular NADH and NADPH may be responsible, at least in part, for the observed oxygen enhancement of cytotoxicity.\n\nIt is well documented that these reactive oxygen species are toxic to cells and several mechanisms have evolved to protect cells against their lethal effects. In particular, the enzyme superoxide dismutase is postulated to ameliorate the toxic effects of O;, and this enzyme is ubiquitously present in aerobic organisms. Anaerobic organisms are not normally exposed to 0; and do not possess SOD (Fridovich, 1981) and are less resistant to the cytotoxic effects of oxygen and UV radiation (Jones et al., 1980). The wellknown observation of the lack of oxygen effects in the toxicity of far-UV radiation upon aerobic organisms may be due to the production of many more direct photoproducts in the DNA by the more energetic far-UV radiation than lesions resulting from sensitization via activated oxygen species. Further, aerobic organisms have cellular defense systems against reactive oxygen metabolites (SOD, catalase, pcarotene, etc.). At longer wavelengths, oxygen effects for toxicity are observed due to the relative reduction in direct photoproduction efficiency coupled with the relatively massive fluences required at these wavelengths, which produce sufficient 0; to overcome cellular defenses. Anaerobes, on the other hand, demonstrate an oxygen effect after far-UV radiation as demonstrated by reduced survival after irradiation of Bacteroides fragilis at 254 nm in the presence of oxygen compared with its absence (Jones et al., 1980), presumably due to a lack of defenses against 0;. We hypothesize that the production of 0; proceeds via a type I1 photosensitization reaction, and that 0, may be responsible for some of the biological effects of near-UV radiation. Several reactions are involved in 0; production that are mediated by the interaction of UV radiation with photosensitizers and ground state oxygen. The ground-state sensitizer (S) absorbs the photon and produces an unstable, excited singlet state, 'S (Eq. 2). (Species in parentheses in Eqs. 2-4 represent postulated excitation states of NADH and NADPH.) The singlet IS crosses over to a more stable triplet state, 3S (Eq. 3), which is sufficiently long-lived to undergo a charge-transfer reaction with ground-state oxygen to produce 0;\n\n(NADH'; NADPH') 'S + 3S (NADH3; NADPH3) (NADH3; NADPH3) 3S + 3 0 2 -+ S+\n+ 0; (NADH\"; NADPH+') (3)(4)\nThe present study demonstrated that 0; is produced upon interaction of near-UV radiation and the ubiquitous cellular coenzymes NADH and NADPH. The reactions producing 0, are typically inefficient, producing low yields of 0,. The quantum yields for the production of 0; at each wavelength (Table 1) show that even at the most energetic wavelength, 290 nm, the molar quantity of 0; produced is very low, producing 4 x molecules of 0, per photon of incident light. Nevertheless, sufficient reactive oxygen was produced by this UV treatment to enhance DNA breakage by 334 nm radiation (Peak et al., 1984~).\n\nDuring preparation of this manuscript, data from Shugar's Laboratory were reported (Czochralska et al., 1984) which included results similar to ours. After near UV-irradiation, NADH and NADPH showed spectral changes as a result of photooxidation of these coenzymes. Superoxide dismutase was able to reduce the magnitude of the photooxidation of NADH and NADPH, which is evidence for the involvement of 0; in these reactions. Hydrogen peroxide, a dismutation product of O;, was also detected (Czochralska et al., 1984). Further evidence for the mechanism of 0; formation proposed in Eqs. 2-4 was obtained by laser excitation of NADH at 353 nm, resulting in the radical cation NADHC' (Eq. 4) (Czochralska and Lindqvist, 1983).\n\nNear UV radiation is not blocked by the earth's protective ozone layer. We, therefore, used radiation at the wavelengths to which human skin is exposed and which are responsible for the increased incidence of skin cancer observed in humans chronically exposed to sunlight. The superoxide anion has been demonstrated to cause a variety of biochemical lesions, including single-strand breaks in DNA (Brawn and Fridovich, 1981) and mutations in prokaryotic (Weitzman and Stossel, 1981; Moody and Hassan, 1982) and eukaryotic cells (Cunningham and Lokesh, 1983;Cunningham et al., 1984). Mutations in dermal cells induced by 0, generated by interaction of solar UV with cellular NADH and NADPH may therefore have relevance in the etiology of sunlight-induced dermal carcinogenesis.\n\nFigureFigure 1 .\n1la,e demonstrates the linear increase in 0; formation as a function of aerobic irradiation (290 '.'[(b) J.
