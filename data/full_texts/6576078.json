These new isosurfaces have the same separating properties as the MC surfaces but they are comprised of quad patches that tend to eliminate the common negative aspect of poorly shaped triangles of the MC isosurfaces.

Both the dual surface algorithm and the iterative smoothing scheme are easily implemented.\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nThe marching cubes (MC) algorithm ( see [10], [11], [12] ) is a widely used technique for computing triangular mesh isosurfaces from discretely sampled volume data over rectilinear lattices. Here we introduce the concept of a dual surface. This dual surface tends to eliminate the poorly shaped triangles often present in MC surfaces. In a nutshell, we obtain this dual surface in the following manner. First, we extend the concept of the MC surface to a patch version which eliminates the edges of the MC surface interior to voxels to obtain a surface, S, with polygon bounded patches where each vertex is included in exactly four patches. Then for each patch of S there is associated a vertex of the dual surface. The dual consists of quad patches which are connected in exactly the same manner as the connectivity of the vertices of the surface S. See Figures 1 and 2. nielson@asu.edu The 4*-network consists of the edges of the MC-Patch surface. An example is shown in the middle image of Figure 1. There is considerable structure to the 4*-network in that it consists of a collection of three, mutually orthogonal planar curves. Here we assume that k j i , , F which guarantees that each vertex is at the intersection of exactly two of these planar polygons. Also, we assume that MC surface is without boundary so that none of its edges are in the boundary planes of the domain lattice. These are not fundamental restrictions, but simply make the discussion here simpler not having to deal with special cases.\n\nIn Section 2, we give the formal definition of the MC-Dual surface and details for computational algorithms. Section 3 contains several examples and applications of the MC-Dual surface. Applying the ideas of the MC-Dual to the MC-Dual itself leads to a new surface which has the same edge connectivity as the original MC-Patch surface. This is discussed in Section 4. The relationship of the present work to other research in the area is explained in Section 5.\n\n\nDUAL MARCHING CUBES\nWe let M j F j , , 1\ndenote the patches of and S In order to proceed with a more rigorous definition of the dual, it will be useful to introduce some of the basic concepts of the MC algorithm and some notation associated with it. Input to the marching cubes algorithm consists of a three dimensional array of values\n(1) M j V V V F j n j j j j ,, 1 , , , 2 1\ndenote the individual vertices which form the boundary of each patch. The topology of is captured in the list of index pointers . The basic strategy consists of producing fragments of the surface one voxel at a time. The triangles produced for a particular voxel depend upon the case/configuration of this voxel. These cases are determined by the relationship of the value of the field function at a lattice point and threshold value. The 256 (= 2^8) cases are grouped into a total of 23 configurations with the equivalence relationship of a rigid rotation. Representers of these equivalence classes are shown in Figure 3.\nS z k y j x i F F k j i , , , , M n , , 1 , 2 1 j j j j j , ,(2)\nwhere each adjacent pair of indices (including cyclic pairs) indicates an edge of S. And now a simple but important observation. Since each vertex, i V , of S lies on an edge of the lattice and since each edge of the lattice has exactly four voxels that share this edge we know that each vertex, i V , of S has exactly four patches which touch (contain) it.\n\nThis topology (neighbourhood connectivity) of the surface fragments, can be represented with a list of 4-tuples 11 10 01 00 (3) where this indicates that i V is common to 11  are connected diagonally as shown in Figure 4.\nN i i i i i , 1 , , ,\nAnd now we introduce a space of MC-Patch surfaces by allowing the vertices to slide any where along their respective edges of the lattice L. We denote this collection of surfaces as X , where is an enumerated volume consisting of a distinguished subset of L. The edges joining a point in to points not in are the same edges containing the vertices of the MC surface. That is,  Definition: Let S is be in X then is a surface comprised of a collection of quad patches with the following properties S 1) For each patch of S there is a vertex j of the dual surface, , lying in the interior of the voxel contianing .  \nC14 C11 C10 C13 C12 C15 C19 C16 C17 C18 C9 C8 C7 C6 C5 C4 C2 C3 C1 C0 C20 C22 C21 ijk F z k y j x i : , ,(4)Q i11 Q i0 1 Q i00 Q i10j F Q S j F P S i S S X S S M j F j , , 1 M j V V V G Q j n j j j j , , 1 , , , 1 1 N i i , , 1 N i Q Q Q Q P i i i i i ,, 1 , , , 11 10 01\n\nS S\n\nIn a manner similar to defining X by allowing the vertices of a specific surface to vary along its edges, we define the space of dual surfaces, by allowing the vertices, j Q , of the specific surface to be anywhere in their respective voxels. S Again, we summarize up to this point. 1) The topology (connectivity of vertices or patches) for both X and is completely determined by the enumerated volume consiting of a subset of the vertices of the lattice L. 2) If we say that two vertices are connected provided there is an edge joining them and that two patches are connected if they have a common edge, then the following hold: The connectivity of the vertices of X is the same as the connectivity of the patches of and the connectivity of the vertices of is the same as the connectivity of the patches of X . 3) There is a one-to-one correspondence between the edges of X S and . The edge joining two vertices of S corresponds to the common edge to their associated quad patches.\n\n\nS\n\nThe way we have presented and described the MC-Dual surface, seems to indicate that it is necessary to compute the surface S and then from this surface compute the dual surface. While for some applications, this might be desirable, it is not necessary and it is certainly possible to directly compute the dual surface. Analogous to the configuration of Figure 3, for the computation of S, we have Figure 5 for . Each configuration of Figure 5 indicates the number of vertices of each configuration produces and how these are connected to the vertices of neighboring voxels. The determination of the connectivity is through the edges. Each quad patch emanating from a vertex intersects the edge as shown in the figure. This edge is connected to the vertex of the adjoining voxel whose patch intersects this common edge. An examination of this figure will reveal that it is carefully constructed so as maintain the same face connectivity of lattice points on the ambiguous faces ( see [11] ). With two distinguished lattice points on opposing corners, we have chosen arbitrarily, but consistently, to separate these lattice points. S Simple splatting algorithm for rendering a dual surface: If no post processing, requiring the topology information, is needed and if all that is required is to render the dual surface then it is possible to do a simple algorithm based upon simply visiting each edge of the lattice edges that has a sign change and render the patch associated with it. For simplicity, assume that the value of a dual vertex is the centroid of the midpoints of the edges associated with this vertex. We simply look at each of the four voxels which share this edge, determine which patch the edge lies in for this voxel and its configuration and compute (or look up) the value of its dual vertex. Having done this for all four voxels which share this edge, we simply then render the quad patch and move onto the next lattice edge with a sign change. lattice and represents a CT scan of the SIGGRAPH 1989 teapot with small version of the AVS lobster inside.\n\n\nS S S\n\n\nEXAMPLES OF MC-DUAL SURFACES\n\nIn Figure 6, we compare the smooth shaded rendering of the MC surface with that of the MC-Dual surface. The big difference is in the specular reflection. The MC surface has many long thin triangles and these lead to abrupt changes and near discontinuities in the highlights. The MC-Dual surface tends to diminish this negative aspect of MC surfaces. Figure 7 illustrates this same improvement, but with a different example. While it is possible to improve somewhat the smooth rendering of the MC surface by using alternative methods of computing estimates of the normal vectors (see [4] ) this problem of long thin triangles is really a phenomena of the uniform sampling of the field function used by the MC algorithm which is diminished by the use of the dual surface.\n\nThe next example illustrates a rather different aspect and application of the MC-Dual surface. Here we have an enumerated volume of size 512x512x200 where each voxel edge is approximately .02 inches. This data is typical of data resulting from the application of segmentation algorithms to scanned medical data, ( See Hu et al. Without additional information or assumptions, we can obtain a rendering of this enumerated volume by displaying the separating midpoint surface. We show this surface and a zoom-in in Figure  8. The midpoint surface is rather blocky, making it difficult to discern shape information. The dual is also a separating surface that makes no assumptions about the values of the field function, but, as is shown in the bottom image of Figure 8, is much smoother and reveals much better shape information.  The top image and middle zoom-in illustrate an enumerated volume foot with a midpoint surface. The MC-Dual, which is also a separating surface that tends to be smoother, is shown in the bottom image.\n\n\nDUAL OF THE DUAL\n\nIn this section, we describe a specific mapping from a MC-Dual surface R , back to a MC-Patch surface, X R\n\n. For each edge of the lattice with a sign change there is an associated quad patch of R. We define to be the surface of R X whose vertices are the intersections of the quad patches of R with the edges of the lattice L. For this we will require that whatever quad patch is used, it must have the property that it always intersects its associated edge of the lattice. For the examples presented here, we use a quad patch comprised of two triangles. There are potentially two possible ways to triangulate a quadrilateral. We consider the projection of the quad patch boundary onto the plane perpendicular to the edge associated with the quad patch. See Figure 9. If this planar quadrilateral is convex then either diagonal is acceptable. If it is not, then one of the points is in the triangle formed by the other three. This point is joined to its opposing point to form the diagonal. The intersection point is then computed using barycentric coordinates. Under some circumstances and modifications, it is also possible to use a bilinear quad patch, but we forego the details of this now.   Figure 13, we show results for a random initial separating surface. In Figure 14, we show some results of the present method applied to segmented MRI data (see Hu et al. [6] ). Rather than use a zoom-in, we have used a down-sampled version of the actually data set so that the effects of the -operator are more apparent.\n\n\nAn example of a Fixed-Point Shroud is shown in Figures 12. In\n\n\nSUMMARY AND REMARKS\n\n\n5.1\n\nRelation to Other Work in the Area In this section, we discuss how the present techniques relate to others in the literature. We first note that meshes dual to the general triangular mesh produced by the MC algorithm are really quite different than the dual meshes we have described here which are dual to the MC-Patch surfaces. This includes the methods of Ohtake and Belyaev [14] which is motivated by the observation that a tangential surface element that is tangential to an implicit surface has a better chance to approximate it than ones that interpolate to it. They use the dual mesh of the general triangular mesh produced by the MC method and additional subdivision to gain better approximations to features\n\nThe cuberille method was first described by Herman and Liu [5] and later Chen et al. [1] discussed methods for estimating normals for displaying these surfaces. The cuberille method is described in terms of voxels belonging to objects and not lattice points as we have used here, but considering the voxels with lattice points being the centers of our voxels we have an equivalent context. Within this context, the boundary surfaces of the cuberille method can be computed per voxel using the scheme indicated in Figure 15. Gaubin [15] has noted that the resulting surfaces are not proper two-dimensional manifolds in that several quad patches can share an edge and mentions ( see Kalvin [8] ) the possibility of regularizing these surface to manifolds by inserting vertices and duplicating edges with a shrinking type of approach. This would be different than the table-look-up technique we have described here and could possibly be viewed as shrinking the surface fragments of Figure 14 to those of Figure 5.\n\nThe edges of the cuberille produced surfaces are subsets of the edges of SurfaceNets ( see Frisken [3] ) which include one vertex per surface cube. A surface cube of this method is defined to be 8 voxel neighbors not all of the same binary value indicating inclusion of the segmented object. Vertices are joined across cube faces and a spring model is used to compute the actual final location of each vertex. Subsequently triangles join the vertices leading to surfaces that can be rendered. A related method is that of Whitaker [16] which he describes as a \"reformulation of the technique of constrained elastic surface nets\" and level sets are used to estimate surfaces of minimal area.\n\nJu et al. [7] describe their method with: \"This method is an interesting hybrid of the EMC method and the SurfaceNets method. It uses the EMC method's feature vertex rule for positioning all vertices of the contour while using the SurfaceNets method to determine the connectivity of these vertices.\" Here, EMC refers to the method of Kobbelt et al. [9].\n\nIn some applications, for example where the rendering of the surface is the only aspect of interest, the lack of the manifold property ( of the three previously mentioned methods) may not be an important problem, but where surface intrinsic properties are needed (e. g. normals, curvature, etc. ) or where any post geometric processing of surfaces is done (simplification, multiresolution, etc.) then the manifold property is important. The separating surfaces described here have this manifold property. This comes at the expense of dealing with more than one vertex per voxel. If the configurations C6, C7, C10, C12, C13, C15, and C18 never occurred, then a much simpler approach could be taken, but these configurations do occur is most applications. We have found that typically these configurations comprise about 1.3% of all configurations C1 to C22. \n\n\n5.3\n\nAdditional Remark If a configuration C16 or C19 ( see Figure 3 and Figure 5 ) share a common ambiguous face, then we get a dual surface where two edges become coincident. The surface is still a two manifold in that no edge is shared by more that two quad patches. This can be viewed as a situation where a topological tunnel has geometrically collapsed. This phenomenon is a result of the decision to be consistent with the MC topology given in Figure 3 to always separate the opposing vertices on the ambiguous faces. Figure 15. The connectivity of the quad patches for the cuberille method.\n\n[5] G. Herman and H. Liu. Three dimensional display of human organs from computed tomograms, Proc. Comp. Graph. Im., 9:1-21, 1979. We have presented our new method as a general framework and have not been specific about certain aspects of the process. For the examples presented here, the vertices of the MC-Dual were simply taken as the centroids of the vertices of the associated patch. How to define and compute the MC-Dual vertices is a wide open research topic with the possibility of variety of new techniques based upon the application domain and/or the information that might be available (e. g. Hermite data). Incorporating the ideas of (the geometry of) surface nets into this context would be interesting. We have investigated some techniques which produce dual surfaces with certain specific Gaussian curvature characteristics and we will report on this in the near future. We are also investigating techniques that will make the -operator the identity operator (or nearly). That is, the vertices of the quad patches are selected so as to yield specified intersection points on the lattice edges. Also, the specific choice of the quad patch for the MC-Dual and its influence on the dualof-the-dual is an open question with choices having effects on the overall characteristics of the Fixed-Point Shroud. Here we used the simple two-triangle quad patch and alluded to the use of a bilinear patch. Patches of higher order continuity would be interesting and potentially useful. In the case where the centroid and two-triangle patch are used, it is easy to see that a new vertex of the dual-of-the-dual is a convex combinations of its star vertices. This property tends to force a number of the patches of the Fixed-Point Shroud to be degenerate with vertices at points of the lattice. Different techniques for choosing the dual vertices will, of course, lead to different results which make this whole topic rather interesting.\n\n\nThe Specific Choices for the Dual Points and the Quad Patches\n\nFigure 2 .\n2The edges of the MC-Patch surface are in black, the vertices of the original MC surface are at the intersections of these polygon curves. The edges of the dual surface, , are in white, where each one is associated with (appears to cross) an edge of the MC-Patch surface. Every vertex of the original MC surface appears to be surrounded by a quad patch of the dual surface.
