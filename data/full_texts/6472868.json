L. W. V. Jensen is explored.Consider the polynomials pn that are orthonormal with respect to the weight function exp(-\\x\\\u00df/\u00df) on the real line, where \u00df is a positive real number.Denoting by y\" the leading coefficient of pn (n > 0) and writing an = y\" i/y\" for n > 1 and an = 0 for n < 0, G. Freud conjectured that / jB-1 Y1/\u00df W A\"L\u00b0-/\"'/'=((/-2)/2) holds for every positive even \u00df (see[3,Conjecture, p. 5]; his conjecture has a slightly different form, as he considered the weight function |jc|pexp(-|jc|^) rather than the one above).He also entertained the possibility that this conjecture is valid for all positive real \u00df.In case \u00df > 0 is even, he proved that if the limit on the left exists then it must have the value on the right-hand side (see [3, Theorem 1 on p. 4]), and he established the conjecture for \u00df = 2, 4, and 6 (see [3, pp.5-6]).He accomplished these by extracting information from the formula(2) -=\\ Pn(x)p\"-X(x)x-l\\x\\ exp -|x| /\u00df) dx,\n\nvalid for all n > 0, which he obtained in a somewhat more general setting in [2, Lemma 1,p. 93].This formula is established via integrating by parts the right-hand side of the equation -= / {nynx\"~l)p\"-AxYxp(-\\x\\ /\u00df)dx = / Pn(x)(pn-Ax)exp(-\\x\\\u00df/\u00df)) dx.\n\nConjecture (1) for positive even values of \u00df was established by Al.Magnus in December 1983; his proof will appear in [19].Previous important works related to Freud's conjecture are Mhaskar-Saff [12] and Rahmanov [16].In particular, they establish the weaker result .^\"\u2022,/\u00ed(n\u00ab,)1/\"-^y;---\u00ab-((/_-2;/2)\"V\u00cdholds for every real \u00df > 0 (cf.[12, formula (3.11) in Theorem 3.3] and the last formula of Theorem 1 in [16, \u00a74, p. 183]).\n\nThe aim of the present paper is to extract additional information from (2) so as to establish Theorem 1.Let \u00df > 0 be an even integer.Then an/nx/^ has an asymptotic expansion (3) aJn^-ZW 1 = 0\n\nIn other words, 2/ m (4) a\"/n^=\u00bfZc2ln-2'+o(n-2'\")\n1 = 0\nfor every integer m > 0 as n -* oo.\n\nA detailed discussion of asymptotic expansions can be found e.g. in P. Henrici [6,Chapter 11,pp.351 ff].We do not know whether or not there is a value of n for which the series on the right of (3) converges.Theorem 1 is known in the special cases \u00df = 2,4,6, which are exactly the cases in which Freud [3, pp. 5-6] established the validity of (1).In case \u00df = 2, thcpn(x/ /2 ) are the Hermite polynomials (save for a constant factor depending on n), and it is easy to see that an= {\u00f1 (cf.(8) below).For \u00df = 4, Theorem 1 was proved by J. S. Lew and D. A. Quarks, Jr. [10], and for \u00df = 6, it was established in M\u00e1t\u00e9-Nevai [11].The polynomials pn for \u00df -4 were discussed by Nevai in [14 and 15].The latter paper uses the asymptotic expansion given in (3) to derive asymptotic properties of the polynomials pn in case /? = 4.\n\nFrom now on throughout this paper, we will assume that \u00df is a positive even integer, and we will write (5) \u00df = 2k + 2 (k>0).\n\nThen (2) becomes (6) f -f\u00b0x2k + 1Pn(x)pn_AxYM-x2k+2/(2k + 2)) dx, which is easier to handle than ( 2) is in general because of the absence of the absolute value signs.By using the recurrence formula (7) xp\"(x) = an+xpn + x(x) + a\"pn_x(x) (-oo < n < oo)\n\nrepeatedly (see e.g.[1, formula (2.4), p. 17]-the a\" there is not the same as our a\"-or [17, formulas (3.2.1) and (3.2.2), p. 42]; note that pn does not occur on the right-hand side of ( 7), as the weight function is even), it is possible to express the right-hand side of (6) as a homogeneous polynomial of degree 2k + 1 of the variables an+j for certain small values of/ (in fact, |/| < k, as we will see).This polynomial can be described as follows.Imagine an elevator that can travel between floors numbered by integers between -oo and + oo which stops at every floor and then continues either in the same direction or in the opposite direction (or stops altogether).Each passage between adjacent floors, briefly called a passage, takes a unit length of time.The length of a trip is the number of passages it consists of.The polynomial in question can be described as the sum of terms corresponding to all trips of length 2k + 1 from floor 0 to floor -1 in the following way.For such a trip, the corresponding term will be the product of factors an+j for each passage between floors/ and/ -1 in either direction (i.e. up or down).\n\nIt is not difficult to verify that this is indeed a correct description of the polynomial obtained on the right-hand side of (6).In fact, applying (7) repeatedly to the expression x2k+1pn(x) on the right-hand side of (7), each application decreases the exponent of x.After 2k + 1 applications, the expression obtained will be a linear combination of pn+l(x) for |/| < 2k + 1, with polynomials of an+j as coefficients.In view of the orthogonality relations, the coefficient of pn_x(x) will be the value of the integral on the right of (6).After t applications of (7) to x2k+lpn(x), we will have a linear combination of x2k+l^'pn+l(x) for |/| < t, the coefficient of this polynomial being the sum of terms corresponding, in the way described above, to all trips of length t from floor 0 to floor /.This can be easily proved by induction on /.The case t = 2k + 1 and / = -1 gives the polynomial described in the preceding paragraph.(The formula expressing xjpn(x) as a linear combination of pn+l(x) for |/| </, obtained by repeated apphcations of recurrence equation (7) as described above, is discussed in Nevai [13,Lemma 12,p. 45] in the more general case when p\"(x) itself occurs also on the right-hand side of the recurrence equation).\n\nThus, ( 6) becomes (8) n/an = p(a\"+j:\\j\\^k),\n\nwhere P is the polynomial described above; note that P does not depend on n directly.(Now it is clear why no an+j for |/| > k occurs on the right-hand side of (8): because the floors k + 1 or -k -2 can not be reached on the trips mentioned in the description of P.) (8) can also be written as n = anp{an+/ \\A^k).\n\nIt will be easy to derive Theorem 1 with the aid of the results of M\u00e1t\u00e9-Nevai [11] from Theorem 2. Let z be an arbitrary complex number with \\z\\ = 1.Then k (9) zZ zld(x0P(xJ:\\jUk))/dx!^0 l=-k holds provided Xj = l/or|/| < k.\n\nIn order to prove this theorem, we will calculate the first order partial derivatives\nof Patxj = 1,|/| < k: Lemma 1. We have dP(x\u00a1: I/| < k) <10> '\u00bf for \\l\\ < k andxj = 1 (\\j\\ < k).\nIn hght of the description of the polynomial P above, it is easy to give a description of the value of the partial derivative on the left-hand side of (10).It is the number of all passages between floors / and / -1 (up or down) summed over all trips of length 2k + 1 from floor 0 to floor -1.\n\nWe will discuss the following, more general situation.Let L, h, p,q be integers such that L > 0 and \\p -q\\ = 1.Let RLh(p, q) be the number of passages from floor p to floor q (in this direction) summed over all trips of length L from floor 0 to floor h.Then (11) dP(Xj: l/l < k)/dx, = R2k+l,-A\u00a1 -1, /) + *2*+i,-iC / -1)\n\nfor all Xj = 1 (l/l < k) according to the description of the left-hand side given in the preceding paragraph.Thus Lemma 1 will be an easy consequence of Lemma 2. Let L, p, q, h be integers such that L > 0 and\\p -q\\ -l.In order that RLj,(p, q) > 0 it is necessary that (12) L = h (mod 2).\n\nProvided that this is satisfied, we have (13) RlAp><)-\u00bfJ/) (if d < 0 this sum is taken to be 0), where d is defined by the equation\n(14) d = dL,h(p, q) = (L -(|p| +l+\\h- q\\))/2.\nProof.The necessity of (12) for RLh(p, q)> 0 is obvious.Assume ( 12) from now on.It then follows that d as defined by ( 14) is an integer, since h and \\p\\ + 1 + \\h -q\\ = \\p\\ + \\q -p\\ + \\h -q\\ have the same parity.On account of this equality, (14) can be written as (15) d=dL\u00bf(p,q)={L-(\\p\\ + \\q-p\\ + \\h-q\\))/2, which will be useful later.To prove (13), observe that RL,h(P>(\u00a1) satisfies the following equations:\n\n(i) RLth(p,q) = RL,-\"(-p,-q), ( 16)\nOO RL,h(p,<i) = RL,2P-h(p,2p- i)> (\u00dci) RL,h(P>l) = RL,2q-h(P^)-\nIndeed, (i) corresponds to reversing the entire run of the elevator, i.e., for a given trip, of length L from floor 0 to floor h, replacing each passage up with a passage down, and each passage down with a passage up.The resulting trip will be of length L, will start at floor 0 and stop at floor -h.(ii) corresponds to reversing the run of the elevator after it reaches floor p for the first time during its trip, and (iii) corresponds to reversing its run after it reaches floor q the last time during its trip.It is easy to see from ( 14) or ( 15) that dLh(p,q) satisfies the analogous equations.Thus the right-hand side of ( 13) also satisfies the analogous equations.\n\nTherefore, it is sufficient to establish (13) in case (17) 0^p<q^h.\n\nIndeed, (16)(i) allows one to assume thatp > 0, (16)(ii), that q > p, and (16)(iii), that h > q.Assume (17) from now on; then we have (18) d=(L-h)/2 according to (15).We can now prove (13) by induction on L.\n\nTo this end, observe first that ( 13) is valid in case L < h, since both sides are 0 (there is no way to reach floor h from floor 0 in L steps, and the sum on the right of ( 13) is empty).Assuming L > h (and ( 17)), we have (19) RlAp> q) -Rl-lh-Ap, q) + Rl-i,h+Ap> q) + V^-m-iwhere dqh = 1 if q = h and 0 otherwise, and NL_Xh_x is the number of all trips from floor 0 to floor h -1 in L -1 steps, that is (assuming ( 17)),\n\n\nL-l \\ (L-l (20) N^\"-''-\\(L-h)A)~\\ d\n\nThe first equality here holds in view of the fact that a trip of length L-l from floor 0 to floor h -1 consists of (L + h -2)/2 passages up and (L -h)/2 passages down, arranged in an arbitrary order, and the second equality holds in view of (18).Equation ( 19) is simply saying that the last passage of each trip from floor 0 to floor \u00ab is a passage either from floor h -1 to floor h, or from floor h + 1 to floor h, and the last term adds the number of passages from floor p to q that takes place as the last passage of the trip.This number is NL_X h_x if q = h (asp = h -1 in this case according to (17)), and otherwise it is 0.\n\nAssume now that L > h and (13) holds for every quadruple (L -1, h', p', q') replacing (L, h, p,q).(The latter is assumed to satisfy (17), but the former is not required to satisfy the analogue of (17), as in view of (16) this restriction is not necessary).We distinguish two cases (a) h > q, and (b) h = q.In both cases, dL-i,h + Ap,q) = d-1 (= dLh(p,q) -1), and , ..id in case (a), \u00bf\u00bf-l.A-l(/>>?)=, -. \u25a0 /,x {d -1 in case (b).\n\nThus, according to the induction hypothesis, (19) becomes\nd i r -, \\ d-\\\nL-l j RL,\u00c1P,q)= E (L/1)+ i ( j --00 ' ' _/' = -00 \u00een case (a) (we use the convention (21) (J) = 0 for/<0; thus it does not matter whether the lower limit of the sums is/ = 0 or/ = -oo, but the latter choice is technically more convenient), and\n1 'L-l\\ , ^ (L-l\\ \u00a1L-l *\u00ab<>\u2022\u00ab>-\u00a3 ; +a[j + d y = -oo * ' y = -oo x '\nin case (b) (the last term on the right is explained by (20)).Hence (13) follows.This completes the proofof the lemma.An alternative proof of Lemma 2 is based on Lemma 3. The identity\n(22) \u00ca,X+.2',1'-V)- I '*+' + 1 J \\ n -J \\ J\nholds for all reals x and y and every integer n.\n\nAccording to (21), the limits of the sums on both sides could just as well be taken to be 0 and n.We will give a direct proof of this identity and discuss its relationship to an identity of J. L. W. V. Jensen after the\n\n\nAlternative\n\nProof of Lemma 2. We will describe another way to derive (13) from ( 12) and ( 17); the justification for the assumption of ( 17) was given in the first proof of Lemma 2.\n\nAssume ( 12) and ( 17).We will count the number of passages from floor p to floor q that take place in the time interval [p + 2/, p + 2/ + 1], where -oo <j< oo.The number of ways to reach floor p from floor 0 inp + 2/ passages is P + 2J j by p + j passages up and / passages down arranged in an arbitrary order (the case / < 0, while absurd, causes no trouble in view of ( 21)).The number of ways to reach floor h at time L, starting at floor q at timep + 2/ + 1 = q + 2/ (cf.( 17)) is / L-q-lj \\ \\(L-h)/2-j) by h -q + (L -h)/2 -j passages up and (L-h)/2 -j passages down.(These numbers are integers in view of ( 12)).It is important to notice that h-q+(L-h)/2 -j > (X -h)/2 -j in view of (17), so the fact that either of these numbers might be negative causes no trouble, since the above binomial coefficient is 0 in this case according to (21) (in the absence of this inequality, it might happen that the left-hand side is negative, while the right-hand side is not; in this case the above binomial coefficient need not be 0, and this would cause errors in the calculation).The number of passages from floor p to floor q in the above time interval is the product of the above binomial coefficients.Summing for/, we obtain (in case ( 17) holds) that where the second equality holds according to Lemma 3 (note thatp + (L -q) + 1 = L in view of ( 17)).In virtue of (18), this is identical to (13) in case (17) holds.Thus the second proof of Lemma 2 is complete.Proof of Lemma 3. We will outline two ways identity ( 22) can be obtained.The shorter one is to derive it, from an identity of J. L. W. V. Jensen saying that holds for every complex x, y, and /, and every integer n > 0 (cf.[7, p. 313; 4; 5, p. 246; 9, Problem 28 in \u00a71.2.6 (p.28; solution p. 485)], plus some papers quoted in [5]).To derive (22) from this, apply the transformation (z\u00a1) = (-l)'(\"z+{_1) to all three binomial coefficients occurring in (22); the resulting identity will be a special case of (24) with t = -1 (cf.( 21)).\n\nAnother way to prove identity (22) avoids the appeal to (24).To outline this proof, first notice that, both sides of (22) being polynomials of degree < n in x and y, it is sufficient to prove (22) in case x + y is an integer > -1.Writing I(x, y, n) for the formula in (22), it is easy to show by an application of the identity (j~\\) + (71) = (j) that I(x, y -1, n -1) and I(x, y -1, n) imply I(x, y, n).\n\nTherefore, to complete a proof by induction, we have to show only that I(x, y, 0) and I(x, -x -1, n) (n > 0) are valid.The former is obvious, and the latter can be written as (25) -Jr\u00bfC;)(-i)n^(;) = i, \"\u2022 y' = 0V '\n\nwhere P(j) \u2022\u25a0 n\"_i(* +/ + /).The sum on the left-hand side, however, equals the \u00abth difference (E -l)nP(0) of P(x) at jc = 0 (here E is the forward shift operator: Ef(x) = f(x + 1)) according to the binomial theorem.Thus, the left-hand side of (25) equals the leading coefficient of P; thus (25) is verified (cf.e.g.[8, pp. 131-132] or formula (35) in [9, p. 63]).The proof of Lemma 3 is complete.Above, we used Lemma 3 to give an alternative proof of Lemma 2. Another way of looking at the two proofs of Lemma 3 is that they establish the second equality in (23) for all integers L > 0 and p, q, h satisfying ( 12) and ( 17) (the first proof giving the third expression in (23) and the second one giving the second expression).As these restrictions allow n = (L -h)/2 to be any integer, and x = p and y = L -q to be any integers x > 0 and y > L -h = 2n, respectively, one obtains a purely combinatorial proof of (22) in this way in all those cases when (22) can be expected to express a combinatorial fact.\n\nWe are now in a position to give the Proof of Lemma 1.Using (11) and ( 13) one obtains (10).In case / = 0 in (11), one obtains but this is easily seen to be equal to the expression given on the right-hand side of (10).In case / \u00a5= 0, one obtains the right-hand side of (10) directly.The proof of Lemma 1 is complete.Theorem 1 will be a simple corollary of Lemma 4. Let X,, 0 </</: + 2 (k > 0), be a strictly convex sequence of real numbers, i.e. such that (/ + l)K,(x) = \u00bf 1/2 + \u00bf cosrx = (l/2)(sin((/ + l)x/2)/sin(x/2))2 7=0\\ r=l / (interpret the right-hand side as its limit at points where the denominator is 0; cf.e.g.[18, Vol.I, p. 88]).It is seen from here that K\u00a1(x) > 0; moreover, K0(x) = 1/2 ( > 0) for every x.Thus (28) is impossible in view of (26).The proof is complete.\n\nNote that only A2A, > 0 was used in most cases instead of the full force of (26).We need to assume strict inequality either only in case / = 0 or else, for example, in case / = r and / = \u00ed for some r, s with 0 < r < s < k that are relatively prime (this latter is sufficient, since, as is easily seen, Kr(x) = Ks(x) = 0 cannot happen for any x).\n\nWe are now able to present the Proof of Theorem 2. Observe that we have i(l:M<Jfc)-(2* + 1)\n\nfor the polynomial P discussed in ( 8)- (10).Indeed, for Xj = 1 (|/| < k) all terms of P being 1, this is just the number of terms in P, i.e. the number of trips of length 2k + 1 from floor 0 to floor -1 (k passages up and k + 1 passages down, arranged in an arbitrary order).Thus, in view of (10) (and the product rule for differentiation), Comparison with the former formula shows that the latter formula is valid even in case / = 0. Putting Xk+X = Xk+2 = 0 (which, again, is in harmony with the latter formula), it is seen that \"\u2022-iV\u00eeYi\"\u00ab?\u00bb)\u00bb \u00ab\u00ab'<*>\u25a0 Therefore Lemma 4 shows that (29) must hold for |z| = 1.This establishes (9), completing the proof of Theorem 2. Finally, we will show how Theorem 2 and the results of M\u00e2t\u00e9-Nevai [11] can be put together to give the Proof of Theorem 1.
