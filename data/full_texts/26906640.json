Typically, the effects of ultraviolet light are studied, as it is this part of the spectrum, which has been found to be the primary source of photoactivity. Nevertheless, some ROS are observed when tissue is illuminated with visible light [3,4]. The levels of ROS produced in this manner appear to be too low to cause significant damage to cells, except at high doses of illumination [4]. However, it has been proposed that ROS production is the mechanism by which low energies of visible light affect cells [5], a phenomenon which has been observed in many studies. Reported effects include cell proliferation [6,7] and differentiation [8], stimulation of collagen synthesis [9] and fertilizing capability of sperm cells [10]. Clinical uses for visible light include wound healing and pain attenuation [11].\n\nLittle research has been done on the photochemical mechanisms of the effects of visible light. The light must be absorbed by an endogenous chromophore in order for it to have an effect. The cell contains various molecules capable of absorbing visible light, but it is unclear which ones are capable of having significant biological effects when excited. Karu [12] has reviewed the subject and suggested cytochrome c oxidase as the primary photoacceptor, based on the similarity between its absorption spectrum and the action spectrum of the proliferation increase in HeLa cells. Various mechanisms, including ROS production, are postulated by Karu as to how the excited cytochrome c oxidase affects the cell. However, other proteins, such as NAD(P)H oxidase [5] and hemoglobin [10] have also been suggested as a source of ROS.\n\nThe hypothesis that ROS mediate the effects of visible light is supported by the findings that low levels of ROS have various non-destructive effects on cells, and are naturally produced as signal messengers [13]. In addition, antioxidants have been reported to inhibit the effect of visible light on cells [7,10].\n\nIn this study, we used electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy to detect free oxyradicals formed during illumination. The aim of the study was to identify the endogenous photosensitizer which is responsible for light-induced ROS formation, and thus to better understand the role of ROS formation in the interaction of visible light and tissue.\n\n\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\n\n\nCardiac Sample Preparation\n\nCardiac cells from 1-2 day old rats were grown for 4-6 days in culture dishes coated with gelatin/collagen, as\n\nThe article describes research performed by Maor Eichler as partial fulfillment of the requirements for his PhD at Bar-Ilan University.\n\n*Correspondence to: Maor Eichler, MSc, Department of described previously [14], except that 10 mm culture dishes with 10 7 cells each were used. The cells were then rinsed three times with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and scraped off into a solution of PBS with 1 mM phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride (PMSF) and 2.1 mM leupeptin. One milliliter samples were prepared from 3\u00c210 7 cells. Homogenization was done with a Dounce homogenizer.\n\n\nSperm Sample Preparation\n\nSperm cells were obtained from fresh ram semen and rinsed three times by centrifugation in the suspension buffer. For experiments on live cells, the cells were suspended in Ringer glucose phosphate buffer [15]. For preparation of homogenates, cells were suspended in PBS with 1 mM PMSF and 2.1 mM leupeptin. One milliliter samples were prepared from approximately 1 mL of sperm. Homogenization was by sonication for 40 seconds at level 6 of a B-12 Sonifier (Branson, CT).\n\n\nEPR Measurements\n\nTen microliters of 0.18 M 5,5-dimethyl-1-pyrroline Noxide (DMPO) was added to 90 mL of sample. The samples were then drawn into a gas-permeable Teflon capillary (Zeus, NJ) and inserted into a narrow quartz tube open at both ends. The tube was then placed into the EPR cavity, and the spectra were recorded on a Bruker EPR 100d Xband spectrometer while illuminating the samples in the EPR cavity. The EPR measurement conditions were as follows: frequency, 9.75 GHz; power, 20 mW; scan width, 60 G; resolution, 1,024; receiver gain, 6.3\u00c210 4 ; conversion time, 164 milliseconds; time constant, 655 milliseconds; number of scans, 2. Samples were illuminated by a homemade tungsten halogen lamp at 40 mW/cm 2 . For all measurements, illumination started 1 minute before scanning and continued for the duration of the measurement.\n\n\nOptical Measurements\n\nA Schott BG-37 filter was used to selectively transmit wavelengths below 500 nm and a Schott UG-1 filter for wavelengths below 400 nm. A solution of FMN was used to transmit wavelengths above 500 nm (10% transmission at 500 nm). A Schott KG-3 filter was used for broadband measurements to control for losses due to reflection. Absorption was measured by a Cary 300 Scan spectrophotometer (Varian). The emission spectrum of the light source was measured with an AQ-6315 optical spectrum analyzer (Ando, Japan).\n\n\nDialysis\n\nSamples were dialyzed for 18 hours in Sigma cellulose membrane dialysis tubing ( > 90% retention of cytochrome c after 10 hours). Samples were dialyzed against 0.5 L Ca 2\u00fe and Mg 2\u00fe -free PBS or $2 mL PBS with protease inhibitors.\n\n\nFractionation\n\nCardiac cell homogenates were centrifuged at 600g for 10 m to pellet nuclei, unbroken cells and cellular debris. The supernatant was centrifuged at 13,000g for 15 m to pellet mitochondria. The supernatant was further centrifuged for 1 hour at 100,000g to pellet the remaining microsomal membranes. Pellets were resuspended in 1 mL PBS with 1 mM PMSF and 2.1 mM leupeptin to produce the nuclear, mitochondrial, and microsomal fractions. The final supernatant represented the cytosolic fraction.\n\n\nChemicals\n\nAll chemicals were obtained from Sigma. Bovine cytochrome c was purchased in an oxidized state. Cytochrome c was reduced by sodium dithionite, which was then removed by dialysis. Redox states of cytochrome c were confirmed by measuring the absorption spectrum.\n\n\nRESULTS\n\nIn both cardiac and sperm cells, illumination produces a quartet characteristic of the adduct DMPO-OH. It is not clear that hydroxyl radical is produced, as DMPO-OH may result from the decay of other adducts, such as DMPO-OOH [16]. The signals of other adducts, such as DMPO-H, are occasionally visible, but these signals are difficult to reproduce.\n\nThe dependence of free radical production on the wavelength of illumination was tested with the aid of several filters, as described in Materials and Methods. No significant signal was detected for illumination by wavelengths above 500 nm or below 400 nm (Fig. 1). The absence of any signal resulting from UV illumination is presumably because of the very low intensity of UV light emitted from our lamp (Fig. 2). These results are obtained in both cardiac and sperm cells, and in both live cells and cell homogenates.\n\nCardiac cell homogenate was fractionated by centrifugation, in order to determine the localization of the endogenous photosensitizer in the cell. The cytosolic fraction produced the strongest DMPO-OH signal when illuminated (Fig. 3). The absorption spectrum of the cytosolic fraction shows the presence of reduced cytochrome c (Fig. 4). However, we found that neither reduced nor oxidized cytochrome produce free radicals when illuminated, even at high concentrations (not shown).\n\nDialysis of cell homogenate against 0.5 L buffer completely abolished the DMPO-OH signal. To eliminate the possibility that dilution of the protease inhibitors led to destruction of the photosensitizer, homogenates were dialyzed in a small volume of buffer with protease inhibitors. This led to a small signal being observed in both the homogenate and in the dialysis buffer (Fig. 5), indicating that the endogenous photosensitizer is small enough to cross the dialysis membrane (<12 kD). These results were obtained in both cardiac and sperm cells.\n\nAs the results indicate that the endogenous photosensitizer is small, water-soluble and active only at wavelengths below 500 nm, we hypothesized that it is a flavin. We found that flavin mononucleotide and riboflavin produce a DMPO-OH signal when illuminated. To estimate the flavin concentration required to produce the DMPO-OH signal seen in cell samples, various concentrations of FMN were illuminated both alone and when added to cell homogenate (Fig. 6).\n\n\nDISCUSSION\n\nSimilar results were obtained from cardiac cells and sperm cells. This suggests that the results represent a general property of cells, as opposed to the property of a specific cell type.\n\nA significant result of this study is that the ROS observed by EPR when cells are illuminated by white light [4] are apparently created solely by light from the blue part of the spectrum (400-500 nm), even though this part of the spectrum represents only a small fraction of the light emitted by the halogen lamp. This was true for both cardiac cells and sperm cells. Little research has been done so far on the non-destructive effects of blue light on cells. Studies on E. coli and HeLa cells have found that blue light promotes proliferation at doses an order of magnitude lower than red light [12], although other studies have found a more  moderate difference in wavelength dependence [17]. The high sensitivity to blue light is consistent with a free radical mechanism, but as it is common for chromophores to absorb blue light more strongly than red light, the similarities of the wavelength dependences may be coincidental. In addition, the 400-500 nm range has been found to be primarily responsible for light-induced cell death [18]. As most studies of biological effects of visible light use monochromatic light with longer wavelengths [6][7][8][9][10]19], it is difficult to reconcile our results with the hypothesized connection between ROS and the effects of visible light, except for effects which depend on blue light. However, the formation of ROS in this study by long wavelengths cannot be completely ruled out. One possibility is that ROS such as H 2 O 2 and singlet oxygen, which do not react with DMPO and thus were not observed, have biological effects. Another possibility is that ROS have significant effects at concentrations below the threshold of detection in this study.\n\nThe endogenous photosensitizer responsible for the ROS production observed here was not localized to the mitochondria or any cellular membrane. This appears to rule out the heme of mitochondrial cytochromes as candidates. A possible exception is cytochrome c, which was observed spectroscopically in the aqueous fraction of the cells. The presence of cytochrome c outside of the mitochondria is probably due to the fact that it is relatively weakly bound to the mitochondrial membrane. However, cytochrome c did not produce free radicals when illuminated in either redox state. In addition, the dialysis experiments rule out any coenzyme which is tightly bound to a protein the size of cytochrome c (12 kD) or larger. Thus, cytochrome c is not responsible for the free radical production, and it is unlikely that any other protein is either.\n\nFlavin is present in cells primarily as FAD and FMN. Flavins are small, water-soluble molecules known to initiate free radical reactions when excited by light, and they do not absorb wavelengths above 500 nm. There is approximately 50 mM of flavin in mammalian heart tissue, similar to concentrations in other tissues [20]. This is enough to produce an EPR signal considerably larger than the one observed here. Most flavin molecules in the cell are bound to proteins, and this may reduce their reactivity. The DMPO-OH signal observed in cell homogenates matches that of $100 nM FMN. If only free or loosely bound flavin molecules act as photosensitizers, an assumption supported by the results of the dialysis experiments, then there must be $100 nM free flavin in our homogenates. Because the cell contents are diluted by one to two orders of magnitude during sample preparation, the cells must have micromolar concentrations of free flavin to produce the observed free radical signal. This is consistent with the free flavin values reported by Tu and Weissman [21]. The absence of observable flavin absorption in the cytosol (Fig.  4) can be explained by the difficulty in detecting submicromolar concentrations of flavin (e 450 $10,000), particularly when there is interference by scattering.\n\nFlavins have previously been found to be responsible for visible light induction of free radical reactions in cell medium [22] and in beverages [23]. The chemistry of photosensitization of biomolecules by riboflavin has been studied extensively and found to be complex [24][25][26][27]. Photosensitization by flavins has been suggested to have significant biological effects, such as mutagenesis [28]. However, this is to our knowledge the first study identifying flavins as the endogenous photosensitizers responsible for ROS formation in cells illuminated by visible light. Because ROS have been shown to have significant physiological effects, we conclude that light-induced free radical formation sensitized by flavins may play a significant role in interactions between blue light and tissue. sperm homogenate cardiac homogenate PBS Fig. 6. Free radical production by flavin mononucleotide. FMN of 0, 10, 100 and 1,000 nM were added to samples containing sperm cell homogenate, cardiac cell homogenate or PBS, and the samples were then illuminated. In all samples, 1 mM FMN produces a signal considerably larger than those observed in homogenates with no added FMN, and 10 nM FMN has little effect. 100 nM FMN produced the signal nearest to that produced in homogenates.\n\nFig. 1 .\n1Wavelength dependence of free radical production. A clear signal is observed only at wavelengths above 400 nm and below 500 nm. The signal fits that of the DMPO-OH quartet, with a N \u00bc a H \u00bc 15 G. Results from illuminated homogenized cardiac cells and live sperm cells are shown. All results are presented on the same scale. Whole cardiac cells and homogenized sperm cells produced similar results.\n\nFig. 2 .\n2Emission spectrum of light source.

A clear signal is observed only in illuminated cytosolic fractions, whereas the signal is considerably weaker in mitochondrial fractions. Other fractions (nuclei/debris and microsomes) also gave little or no signal when illuminated (not shown).\n\nFig. 4 .Fig. 5 .\n45Absorption spectrum of cytosolic fraction of cardiac cells. The narrow peak at 550 nm, the low, broad peak at approximately 515 nm, and the larger Soret band fit the absorption spectrum of reduced cytochrome c. The gradual rise at lower wavelengths is probably a result of Rayleigh scattering.
