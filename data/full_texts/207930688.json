Recently, we have witnessed fast growing research effort on wireless communication using RISs. RISs have been utilized to realize new wireless transceiver architectures in [12]-[15], which may bring a paradigm-shift on the transceiver design and reduce the hardware cost of future wireless communication systems. Moreover, RISs can artificially reshape the electromagnetic wave propagation environment [16]. In current wireless communication systems, the wireless environment, i.e., the physical objects that influence the propagation of the electromagnetic waves, is uncontrollable. During the research and design processes of wireless communication systems, one can only design transceivers, signal processing algorithms, and transmission protocols to adapt to the radio environment. RISs, on the other hand, may in principle make the wireless environment controllable and programmable, thus bringing unprecedented new opportunities for enhancing the performance of wireless communication systems [17] [18]. Against this background, various RIS-assisted wireless communication systems have recently been studied, by providing cost-effective and energy-efficient solutions that offer performance improvements and coverage enhancement in wireless networks. [19]. For example, [20] showed that, by jointly optimizing active and passive beamforming in an RIS-assisted wireless network, the energy consumption and the coverage performance can be significantly improved. The joint beamforming design was also investigated for improving the physical layer security [21] [22]. The authors of [23]-[25] optimized the achievable rate of RIS-assisted systems in different communication scenarios. The energy efficiency of RIS-based downlink multi-user MISO systems was maximized in [26] [27]. Energy harvesting performance, ergodic spectral efficiency, symbol error probability, and outage probability of RIS-assisted wireless communications were derived and optimized in [28]-[31]. The comparison with relays was carried out in [32]. The impact of hardware imperfections, like discrete phase-shift and phase-dependent amplitude, were studied in [29] [33] [34].However, the major limitation of existing research on RIS-assisted wireless communications is the lack of tractable and reliable physical and electromagnetic models for the RISs. Most of the existing research works are based on simplistic mathematical models that regard the RIS as a diagonal matrix with phase shift values. The responses of the RISs to the radio waves have not yet been extensively studied from the physics and electromagnetic point of view, which may lead to relatively simplified algorithm designs and performance predictions. To the best of the authors' knowledge, in particular, there is no experimentally validated path loss model for RIS-assisted wireless communications, even in the simple free-space propagation environment. The path loss\n\nI. INTRODUCTION\n\nIt is foreseen that the commercial service of the fifth-generation (5G) of mobile communications will be launched on a worldwide scale from 2020. Massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) base stations (BSs) with full-digital transceivers are being commercially deployed and tested in several countries [1]. Meanwhile, the success of millimeter wave (mmWave) trials and testbeds across the world ensures that mmWave wireless communications will be realized by 2020 [2]. As the two key technologies of the 5G physical layer, massive MIMO and mmWave will significantly increase the network capacity and resolve the spectrum shortage issue in current cellular communication systems [3]. On the other hand, the International Telecommunication Union (ITU) predicted that the exponential growth of the global mobile data traffic will continue, which will reach 5 zettabytes (ZB, 1 ZB = 10 21 Bytes) per month by 2030 [4]. The ever-increasing traffic demands are driven by the emerging data-intensive applications, such as virtual reality, augmented reality, holographic projection, autonomous vehicle, tactile Internet, to name a few, which can hardly be offered by 5G. Therefore, there has been increasing research interest from both academia and industry towards the sixth-generation (6G) of mobile communications.\n\nLooking forward to future 6G wireless communication technologies, one possibility is to further extend the spectrum to terahertz (THz) band [5] and the antenna array scale to ultramassive MIMO (UM-MIMO) [6] [7], which can further boost the spatial diversity and expand the available spectrum resources. Besides, artificial intelligence (AI), orbital angular momentum (OAM) multiplexing, visible-light communications (VLC), blockchain-based spectrum sharing, quantum computing, etc., to name just a few, are being actively discussed as potential enabling technologies for 6G mobile communication systems [8]. Furthermore, reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) 1 , which are an emerging technology to manipulate electromagnetic waves, have drawn significant attentions due to their capability in tailoring electromagnetic waves across a wide frequency range, from microwave to visible light. RIS technology is enabled by metasurfaces comprised of sub-wavelength unit cells with tunable electromagnetic responses, such as amplitude, phase, polarization and frequency, which can be controlled by external signals in a real-time reconfigurable manner during the light-matter interaction [9]- [11]. Their programmable electromagnetic properties make RISs especially appealing for wireless communications. models used in most existing works do not consider physical factors such as the size of the RISs, and the near-field/far-field effects of the RISs. Therefore, channel measurements are urgently needed, which may provide authentic information on the path loss of RIS-assisted wireless communications for researchers working in this emerging research field. Motivated by these conditions, we develop the free-space path loss models of RIS-assisted wireless communications in different scenarios based on the physics and electromagnetic nature of the RISs. We validate them by using numerical simulations, and we also conduct the channel measurements through fabricated RISs in an anechoic chamber to practically corroborate our findings. In particular, our main contributions are summarized as follows:\n\n1) We introduce a system model for RIS-assisted wireless communications from the perspective of electromagnetic theory, which takes into account important physical factors like the physical dimension of the RISs, and the radiation pattern of the unit cells. A general formula is derived to characterize the free-space path loss of RIS-assisted wireless communications.\n\n2) Based on the derived general formula, we propose three free-space path loss models for RIS-assisted wireless communications, which capture three relevant scenarios and unveil the relationships between the free-space path loss of RIS and the distances from the transmitter/receiver to the RIS, the size of the RIS, the near-field/far-field effects of the RIS, as well as the radiation patterns of antennas and unit cells.\n\n3) We report the world's first experimental results that assess and validate the path loss of RIS-assisted wireless communications. Three different RISs (metasurfaces) of various size are utilized in the measurements. The measurement results are shown to be in good agreement with the modeling results. Besides, the power consumption of the RISs and the effect of the incident angle are also measured and discussed.\n\n\nII. PRELIMINARIES\n\nThis section reviews several basic concepts, which will be used in the free-space path loss modeling of RIS-assisted wireless communications in the next section.\n\n\nA. Far Field and Near Field\n\nThe far field and near field are two different regions of the electromagnetic (EM) field around an antenna or antenna array. When a transmitter is sufficiently far away from an antenna array, the spherical wave generated by the transmitter can be approximately regarded as a plane wave at the antenna array side. Specifically, when the maximum phase difference of the received signal on the antenna array does not exceed \u03c0 8 , the transmitter is in the far field of the antenna array [35]. Based on this assumption, the boundary of the far field and the near field 2 of the antenna array is defined as L = 2D 2 \u03bb , where L, D and \u03bb denote the distance between the transmitter and the center of the antenna array, the largest dimension of the antenna array and the wave length of the signal, respectively [35]. It's worth noting that when the transmitter is replaced by a receiver, the above definition remains the same due to the reciprocity of the antenna array.\n\nWe will use the same definition of the far field and near field for the RIS in the next section.\n\nWhen the distance between the transmitter/receiver and the center of the RIS is less than 2D 2 \u03bb , the transmitter/receiver is considered to be in the near field of the RIS. Otherwise, they are in the far field of the RIS.\n\n\nB. Power Radiation Pattern and Gain\n\nThe power radiation pattern defines the variation of the power radiated or received by an antenna as a function of the direction away from the antenna, which allows us to visualize where the antenna transmits or receives the maximum power. The normalized power radiation pattern can be written as a function F (\u03b8, \u03d5) in the spherical coordinate system as shown in Fig. 1. An example of normalized power radiation pattern is the following\nF (\u03b8, \u03d5) = \uf8f1 \uf8f2 \uf8f3 cos 3 \u03b8 \u03b8 \u2208 0, \u03c0 2 , \u03d5 \u2208 [0, 2\u03c0] 0 \u03b8 \u2208 \u03c0 2 , \u03c0 , \u03d5 \u2208 [0, 2\u03c0](1)\nThe specific normalized power radiation pattern represented by (1) is only a function of the elevation angle \u03b8 and is maximized when \u03b8 = 0, which indicates that the corresponding antenna has maximum gain towards the direction of \u03b8 = 0. The term antenna gain describes how much power is transmitted or received in the direction of peak radiation relative to that of an isotropic antenna, which, by assuming 100% antenna efficiency, can be written as [36] Gain = 4\u03c0 2\u03c0 \u03d5=0 \u03c0 \u03b8=0 F (\u03b8, \u03d5) sin \u03b8d\u03b8d\u03d5 .\n\n(2) 2 The near field of an antenna array includes two regions: reactive near field and radiating near field. When the distance from the antenna array is less than \u03bb 2\u03c0 , we are in the reactive near field. When the distance is larger than \u03bb 2\u03c0 and less than 2D 2 \u03bb , we are in the radiating near field [35]. The near field in this paper exclusively refers to the radiating near field.\n\nConsider the antenna with power radiation pattern described by (1) as an example, its gain is equal to 8 (9.03 dBi) under the assumption of 100% radiation efficiency, which means that the power transmitted or received in the direction of peak radiation (\u03b8 = 0) is 9.03 dB higher than that of an isotropic antenna. In the next section, we will use the definition of normalized power radiation pattern not only for the antennas of the transmitter and receiver, but also for the unit cells of the RIS in the free-space path loss modeling of RIS-assisted wireless communications. \n\n\nIII. FREE-SPACE PATH LOSS MODELING OF RIS-ASSISTED WIRELESS COMMUNICATIONS\n\nIn this section, we describe the overall system model and develop the free-space path loss model for RIS-assisted wireless communications in different scenarios.\n\n\nA. System Model\n\nWe consider a general RIS-assisted single-input single-output (SISO) wireless communication system as shown in Fig. 2. Since this paper aims to study the free-space path loss modeling of RIS-assisted wireless communications, the direct path between the transmitter and the receiver is ignored in the rest of the paper. The RIS is placed in the x-y plane of a Cartesian coordinate system, and the geometric center of the RIS is aligned with the origin of the coordinate system.\n\nLet N and M denote the number of rows and columns of the regularly arranged unit cells of the RIS, respectively. The size of each unit cell along the x axis is d x and that along the y axis is d y , which are usually of subwavelength scale within the range of \u03bb 10 and \u03bb 2 . F (\u03b8, \u03d5) is the normalized power radiation pattern of the unit cell, which reveals the dependence of the incident/reflected power density of the unit cell on the incident/reflected angle. G is the gain of the unit cell, which is defined by (2) and is only related to the normalized power radiation pattern F (\u03b8, \u03d5) of the unit cell. U n,m denotes the unit cell in the n th row and m th column with the programmable reflection coefficient \u0393 n,m . The center position of U n,m is\n((m\u2212 1 2 )d x , (n\u2212 1 2 )d y , 0), where m \u2208 1 \u2212 M 2 , M 2\nand n \u2208 1 \u2212 N 2 , N 2 , assuming that both of N and M are even numbers. We use the symbols d 1 , d 2 , \u03b8 t , \u03d5 t , \u03b8 r and \u03d5 r to represent the distance between the transmitter and the center of the RIS, the distance between the receiver and the center of the RIS, the elevation angle and the azimuth angle from the center of the RIS to the transmitter, the elevation angle and the azimuth angle from the center of the RIS to the receiver, respectively. Let r t n,m , r r n,m , \u03b8 t n,m , \u03d5 t n,m , \u03b8 r n,m and \u03d5 r n,m represent the distance between the transmitter and U n,m , the distance between the receiver and U n,m , the elevation angle and the azimuth angle from U n,m to the transmitter, the elevation angle and the azimuth angle from U n,m to the receiver, respectively. As shown in Fig. 2, the transmitter emits a signal to the RIS with power P t through an antenna with normalized power radiation pattern F tx (\u03b8, \u03d5) and antenna gain G t . The signal is reflected by the RIS and received by the receiver with normalized power radiation pattern F rx (\u03b8, \u03d5) and antenna gain G r . Let \u03b8 tx n,m , \u03d5 tx n,m , \u03b8 rx n,m and \u03d5 rx n,m represent the elevation angle and the azimuth angle from the transmitting antenna to the unit cell U n,m , and the elevation angle and the azimuth angle from the receiving antenna to the unit cell U n,m , respectively.\n\nThe following key result presents the connection between the received signal power of the receiver and the various parameters described above in RIS-assisted wireless communication systems.\n\nTheorem 1. The received signal power in RIS-assisted wireless communications is as follows \nP r = P t G t G r Gd x d y \u03bb 2 64\u03c0 3 M 2 m=1\u2212 M 2 N 2 n=1\u2212 N 2 \u221a F combine \u0393 n,\nwhere F combine =F tx \u03b8 tx n,m , \u03d5 tx n,m F \u03b8 t n,m , \u03d5 t n,m F \u03b8 r n,m , \u03d5 r n,m F rx \u03b8 rx n,m , \u03d5 rx n,m , which accounts for the effect of the normalized power radiation patterns on the received signal power.\n\nProof : See Appendix A.\n\nTheorem 1 reveals that the received signal power is proportional to the transmitted signal power, the gains of the transmitting/receiving antennas, the gain of the unit cell, the size of the unit cell, the square of the wave length. In addition, Theorem 1 also indicates that the received signal power is related to the normalized power radiation patterns of the transmitting/receiving antennas and unit cells, the reflection coefficients of the unit cells, and the distances between the transmitter/receiver and the unit cells. However, their specific relationships are not that straightforward, which needs further analysis and discussions in the rest of this paper. Theorem In this paper, we develop the free-space path loss models for RIS-assisted wireless communications in different scenarios, which can be classified into two categories: RIS-assisted beamforming and RIS-assisted broadcasting as shown in Fig. 3. In the RIS-assisted beamforming scenario, the received signal power is maximized for specific user. On the other hand, in the RIS-assisted broadcasting scenario, the signal evenly covers all users in a specific area. We regard (3) as the general formula. As each considered scenario depends on the design of the reflection coefficients of the unit cells, as well as the near-field/far-field effects of the RIS, (3) will be further discussed in different cases to draw more insights on the free-space path loss of RIS-assisted wireless communications.\n\n\nB. Far Field Beamforming Case\n\nThe signals reflected by all the unit cells of RIS to the receiver can be aligned in phase to enhance the received signal power, which makes RIS especially appealing for beamforming applications. Therefore, it is important to study the free-space path loss in the RIS-assisted beamforming scenario. The case where both of the transmitter and receiver are in the far field of the RIS is first discussed as follows. \nP r =P t G t G r GM 2 N 2 d x d y \u03bb 2 F (\u03b8 t , \u03d5 t )F (\u03b8 r , \u03d5 r )A 2 64\u03c0 3 d 1 2 d 2 2 \u00d7 sinc M \u03c0 \u03bb (sin \u03b8 t cos \u03d5 t + sin \u03b8 r cos \u03d5 r )d x sinc( \u03c0 \u03bb (sin \u03b8 t cos \u03d5 t + sin \u03b8 r cos \u03d5 r )d x ) sinc N \u03c0 \u03bb (sin \u03b8 t sin \u03d5 t + sin \u03b8 r sin \u03d5 r )d y sinc \u03c0 \u03bb (sin \u03b8 t sin \u03d5 t + sin \u03b8 r sin \u03d5 r )d y 2 .(4)\nIf \u03b8 r = \u03b8 t and \u03d5 r = \u03d5 t + \u03c0, (4) is maximized as\nP max r = G t G r GM 2 N 2 d x d y \u03bb 2 F (\u03b8 t , \u03d5 t )F (\u03b8 r , \u03d5 r )A 2 64\u03c0 3 d 1 2 d 2 2 P t .(5)\nThe path loss corresponding to (5) is\nP L beam f arf ield = 64\u03c0 3 (d 1 d 2 ) 2 G t G r GM 2 N 2 d x d y \u03bb 2 F (\u03b8 t , \u03d5 t )F (\u03b8 r , \u03d5 r )A 2 .(6)\nProof : See Appendix B.\n\nProposition 1 is more insightful compared with the general formula (3) in Theorem 1 and equation (4) is referred to as the far-field formula. Proposition 1 reveals that the free-space path loss of RIS-assisted wireless communications is proportional to (d 1 d 2 ) 2 in the far field case. The free-space path loss is also related to the unit cells' normalized power radiation pattern F (\u03b8, \u03d5), which is fixed once the RIS is designed and fabricated. Furthermore, when the reflection coefficients of all the unit cells are the same, the RIS performs specular reflection, that is, the incident signal is mainly reflected towards the mirror direction (\u03b8 r = \u03b8 t and \u03d5 r = \u03d5 t + \u03c0).\n\nThe above analysis assumes that all the unit cells share the same reflection coefficient. The design of \u0393 n,m is discussed in the following proposition, which enables the RIS to beamform the reflected signal to the receiver in any desired direction (\u03b8 des , \u03d5 des ) through intelligent reflection 3 .\n\nProposition 2. Assume that the directions of peak radiation of both the transmitting and receiving antennas point to the center of the RIS, and the reflection coefficients of all the unit cells share the same amplitude value A and different phase shift \u03c6 n,m (\u0393 n,m = Ae j\u03c6n,m ). The received signal power through intelligent reflection in the far field case can be written as\nP r =P t G t G r GM 2 N 2 d x d y \u03bb 2 F (\u03b8 t , \u03d5 t )F (\u03b8 r , \u03d5 r )A 2 64\u03c0 3 d 1 2 d 2 2 \u00d7 sinc M \u03c0 \u03bb (sin \u03b8 t cos \u03d5 t + sin \u03b8 r cos \u03d5 r +\u03b4 1 )d x sinc( \u03c0 \u03bb (sin \u03b8 t cos \u03d5 t + sin \u03b8 r cos \u03d5 r +\u03b4 1 )d x ) sinc N \u03c0 \u03bb (sin \u03b8 t sin \u03d5 t + sin \u03b8 r sin \u03d5 r +\u03b4 2 )d y sinc \u03c0 \u03bb (sin \u03b8 t sin \u03d5 t + sin \u03b8 r sin \u03d5 r +\u03b4 2 )d y 2 ,(7)\nwhere \u03b4 1 m\u2212 1 2 d x +\u03b4 2 n\u2212 1 2 d y = \u03bb\u03c6n,m 2\u03c0 . When \u03b8 r = \u03b8 des and \u03d5 r = \u03d5 des as desired, (7) is maximized as\nP max r = P t G t G r GM 2 N 2 d x d y \u03bb 2 F (\u03b8 t , \u03d5 t )F (\u03b8 des , \u03d5 des )A 2 64\u03c0 3 d 1 2 d 2 2 ,(8)when \u03b4 1 = \u2212 sin \u03b8 t cos \u03d5 t \u2212 sin \u03b8 des cos \u03d5 des and \u03b4 2 = \u2212 sin \u03b8 t sin \u03d5 t \u2212 sin \u03b8 des sin \u03d5 des . The corresponding design of \u03c6 n,m is \u03c6 n,m = mod ( 2\u03c0 \u03bb (\u03b4 1 m\u2212 1 2 d x +\u03b4 2 n\u2212 1 2 d y ), 2\u03c0) = mod (\u2212 2\u03c0 \u03bb ((sin \u03b8 t cos \u03d5 t + sin \u03b8 des cos \u03d5 des ) m\u2212 1 2 d x + (sin \u03b8 t sin \u03d5 t + sin \u03b8 des sin \u03d5 des ) n\u2212 1 2 d y ), 2\u03c0).(9)\nProof : See Appendix B.\n\nAccording to the phase shift design described by (9) of Proposition 2, the incident signal from direction (\u03b8 t , \u03d5 t ) to the RIS can be manipulated to reflect towards any desired direction (\u03b8 des , \u03d5 des ) in the far field case, which is referred to as intelligent reflection. Besides, (4) and (7) also indicate that the free-space path loss of RIS-assisted wireless communication has the same scaling law for specular reflection and intelligent reflection in the far-field beamforming case. 3 The intelligent reflection here refers to intelligently controlling the reflection nature of the RIS by properly programming the reflection coefficients of the unit cells of the RIS.\n\n\nC. Near Field Beamforming Case\n\nIn the previous subsection, the path loss analyses for the RIS-assisted beamforming assume that both of the transmitter and the receiver are in the far field of the RIS. The case study\n\nwhere the transmitter and/or the receiver are in the near field of the RIS is discussed in this subsection, which enables the RIS to focus the reflected signal to the receiver by properly design the reflection coefficients \u0393 n,m .\n\nProposition 3. Assume that the reflection coefficients of all the unit cells share the same amplitude value A and different phase shifts \u03c6 n,m and that the RIS-assisted wireless communication system operates in the near field case. The received signal power is written as follows\nP r = P t G t G r Gd x d y \u03bb 2 A 2 64\u03c0 3 M 2 m=1\u2212 M 2 N 2 n=1\u2212 N 2 F combine e \u2212j(2\u03c0(r t n,m +r r n,m )\u2212\u03bb\u03c6n,m) \u03bb r t n,m r r n,m 2 .(10)\nFor the desired receiver at (x r , y r , z r ), (10) is maximized as\nP max r = P t G t G r Gd x d y \u03bb 2 A 2 64\u03c0 3 M 2 m=1\u2212 M 2 N 2 n=1\u2212 N 2 \u221a F combine r t n,m r r n,m 2 ,(11)\nwhen \u03c6 n,m = mod( 2\u03c0(r t n,m + r r n,m ) \u03bb , 2\u03c0).\n\nThe path loss corresponding to (11) is\nP L beam nearf ield = 64\u03c0 3 G t G r Gd x d y \u03bb 2 A 2 M 2 m=1\u2212 M 2 N 2 n=1\u2212 N 2 \u221a F combine r t n,m r r n,m 2 .(13)\nProof : See Appendix B.\n\nProposition 3 gives the phase gradient design of the RIS for the maximization of the received signal power in the near field case and equation (11) is referred to as the near-field beamforming formula. Proposition 3 also formulates the free-space path loss of RIS-assisted wireless communication in the near field beamforming case. However, its dependence on d 1 and d 2 can not be directly inferred from (13), which will be further discussed based on the simulation results in the next section.\n\n\nD. Near Field Broadcasting Case\n\nThe studies conducted in the previous subsections assume that the RIS is employed for beamforming, and, then, the received power is maximized for one specific user. The scenario\n\nwhere the RIS is utilized for broadcasting is discussed in this subsection. When the transmitter is in the near field of the RIS, it means that the transmitter is relatively near to the RIS, thus the electromagnetic wave transmitted to the RIS can be regarded as spherical wave as discussed in Section II. If the RIS is large enough (for example, both of its length and width are 10 times larger than the wavelength), then the incident spherical wave will form a circular and divergent phase gradient on the RIS surface, which is due to the different transmission distances from the transmitter to each unit cell of the RIS. \nP r \u2248 \uf8f1 \uf8f2 \uf8f3 GtAr\u0393 2 4\u03c0(d 1 +d 2 ) 2 P t = GtGr\u03bb 2 A 2 16\u03c0 2 (d 1 +d 2 ) 2 P t , (\u03b8 r , \u03d5 r ) \u2208 \u2126 \u2229 \u2126 t 0, (\u03b8 r , \u03d5 r ) / \u2208 \u2126 \u2229 \u2126 t(14)\nwhere |\u0393 n,m | = |\u0393| = A, and the solid angle \u2126 is enclosed by the extension lines from the mirror image of the transmitter (Tx mirror ) to the edge of the RIS, as illustrated in Fig. 4. The solid\n\nangle \u2126 t is formed by the main lobe of the transmitting antenna of Tx mirror . If the elevation angle \u03b8 r and the azimuth angle \u03d5 r of the receiver are within the intersection of \u2126 and \u2126 t , the receiver can receive the reflected signal from RIS, otherwise it can hardly receive any signal.\n\nThe free-space path loss in the near-field broadcasting scenario can be formulated as\nP L broadcast nearf ield \u2248 16\u03c0 2 (d 1 + d 2 ) 2 G t G r \u03bb 2 A 2 .(15)\nProof: In the near field broadcasting case, the free-space path loss of RIS-assisted wireless communications can also be characterized by the general formula (3) in Theorem 1. In addition, a more insightful result can be obtained by using the approximation based on geometric optics, which is typically employed in ray tracing. For the convenience of analysis, assume that all the unit cells of the RIS share the same reflection coefficient here. As shown in Fig. 4, the mirror image of the transmitter, namely Tx mirror , can be obtained by taking the RIS as the symmetric plane. The signal transmission process is equivalent to that the signal is transmitted from Tx mirror and received by the receiver after travelling distance (d 1 + d 2 ), thus we can get Proposition 4\n\naccording to the conventional free-space path loss model [37]. Similarly, when the receiver is in the near field of the RIS, the same result holds according to the transmitter-receiver reciprocity property revealed by Theorem 1. Formula (14) is referred to as the near-field broadcasting formula, which describes the relationship between the received and transmitted signal power of RIS-assisted wireless communications in the near field broadcasting case, and is more insightful compared with the general formula (3) in Theorem 1.\n\n\nE. Path Loss Model Summary\n\nBased on the modeling results above, the free-space path loss models of RIS-assisted wireless communications in different scenarios are summarized in Table I. \n\n\nApplications\n\n\nConditions Path Loss Notes\n\nBeamforming Transmitter and receiver are in the far field of RIS (6) \u03c6n,m are designed as in (9) Beamforming Transmitter and/or receiver are in the near field of RIS (13) \u03c6n,m are designed as in (12) Broadcasting Transmitter and/or receiver are in the near field of RIS  (4), the near-field beamforming formula (11), the near-field broadcasting formula (14),\n\nand their corresponding path loss formulas (6), (13) and (15), respectively. Three different RISs and two different antennas (corresponding to those used in our measurements, described in Section V) are utilized in the simulations, with their parameters specified in Table II.  \n\n\nX-band horn antenna\n\nF tx (\u03b8, \u03d5) = F rx (\u03b8, \u03d5) = cos 62 \u03b8 when \u03b8 \u2208 0, \u03c0 2 , F tx (\u03b8, \u03d5) = F rx (\u03b8, \u03d5) = 0 when \u03b8 \u2208 \u03c0 2 , \u03c0 .

Gt = Gr = 14.5 dB according to (2) under the assumption that the radiation efficiency is 100%.\n\nThe operating frequency is f = 4.25 GHz.\n\nThe electrical sizes of the RISs are 35\u03bb\u00d735.7\u03bb for the large RIS1, 17.5\u03bb\u00d711.9\u03bb for the large RIS2, and 1.36\u03bb\u00d75.44\u03bb for the small RIS, respectively.\n\nA. RIS-assisted Beamforming 1) Specular Reflection in the Far Field Beamforming Case: P t = 0 dBm, \u03b8 t = \u03c0 4 , \u03d5 t = \u03c0, \u2220\u0393 n,m = \u03c6 n,m = 0. The large RIS1 and X-band antennas are employed in the simulation. When d 1 and d 2 are both greater than 71.4 m, the far field condition of RIS1 is fulfilled. The small RIS and C-band antennas are also employed in the simulation under the same conditions. When d 1 and d 2 are both larger than 1 m, the far field condition of the small RIS is fulfilled. Fig.   5(a) and Fig. 6(a) show the simulated received signal power distribution in various directions in the large RIS1 case and the small RIS case, respectively. It can be seen that the received signal power is maximized when \u03b8 r = \u03c0 4 and \u03d5 r = 0, which indicates that both of the large RIS1 and the small RIS specularly reflect the incident signal. Moreover, the larger the electrical size of the RIS is, the more concentrated the power of the reflected signal. As shown in Fig. 5(b) and Fig.   6(b), the far-field formula (4) matches well with the general formula (3), which validates that the free-space path loss is compliant with (6) under the scenario of RIS-assisted beamforming through specular reflection of RIS in the far field case.  2) Intelligent Reflection in the Far Field Beamforming Case: P t = 0 dBm, \u03b8 t = \u03c0 4 , \u03d5 t = \u03c0. The large RIS1 and X-band antennas are employed in the simulation, and the phase shifts \u03c6 n,m are designed to steer the reflected signal to a desired direction of \u03b8 des = \u03c0 3 and \u03d5 des = 7\u03c0 4 according to (9). The small RIS and C-band antennas are also employed in the simulation, and \u03c6 n,m are designed to steer the reflected signal to a desired direction of \u03b8 des = \u03c0 6 and \u03d5 des = 0. Fig. 7(a) and Fig. 8(a) show that the received signal power is maximized when \u03b8 r = \u03c0 3 , \u03d5 r = 7\u03c0 4 and \u03b8 r = \u03c0 6 , \u03d5 r = 0, respectively, which indicates that both of the large RIS1 and the small RIS successfully reflect the incident signal to the desired direction. As shown in Fig. 7(b) and Fig. 8(b), the far-field formula (7) with phase design matches well with the general formula (3), which validates that the free-space path loss adheres to (6) under the scenario of RIS-assisted beamforming through intelligent reflection of RIS in the far field case.  3) Intelligent Reflection in the Near Field Beamforming Case: P t = 0 dBm, \u03b8 t = \u03c0 4 , \u03d5 t = \u03c0. The large RIS1 and X-band antennas are employed in the simulation, and \u03c6 n,m are designed to focus the reflected signal towards the desired receiver at a certain location of d 2 = 100m, \u03b8 r = \u03c0 4 and \u03d5 r = 0 according to (12). The transmitter is in the near field of RIS1. Fig. 9(a) shows the power distribution of the simulated received signal when d 1 = 3.5 m and d 2 = 100 m. It can be observed that the reflected signal has been successfully focused to the desired receiver (d 2 = 100m, \u03b8 r = \u03c0 4 and \u03d5 r = 0) by applying (12). Fig. 9(b) shows that as d 1 increases, the near-field beamforming formula (11) fits better with the far-field formula (4), although the transmitter is in the near field of the RIS. This is because, when both d 1 and d 2 increase, the distances between the transmitter/receiver and each unit cell become more similar, and the RIS is gradually covered by the main lobe of the transmitting/receiving antenna. Therefore, (11) can be written as\n\u03c6 r =0 \u03c6 r =\u03c0/2 \u03c6 r =3\u03c0/2 \u03c6 r =\u03c0 \u03c6 r =\u03c0/4 \u03c6 r =7\u03c0/4 \u03c6 r =5\u03c0/4 \u03c6 r =3\u03c0/4 \u03b8 r =\u03c0/6 \u03b8 r =\u03c0/3 (\u03b8 r =\u03c0/4, \u03c6 r =0) (a)\u03c6 r =0 \u03c6 r =\u03c0/2 \u03c6 r =3\u03c0/2 \u03c6 r =\u03c0 \u03c6 r =\u03c0/4 \u03c6 r =7\u03c0/4 \u03c6 r =5\u03c0/4 \u03c6 r =3\u03c0/4 \u03b8 r =\u03c0/6 \u03b8 r =\u03c0/3 (\u03b8 r =\u03c0/4, \u03c6 r =0) (a)P max r \u2248 P t G t G r Gd x d y \u03bb 2 A 2 64\u03c0 3 M 2 N 2 F (\u03b8 t , \u03d5 t )F (\u03b8 r , \u03d5 r ) d 1 2 d 2 2 ,(16)\nby applying F tx (\u03b8 tx n,m , \u03d5 tx n,m ) \u2248 1, F rx (\u03b8 rx n,m , \u03d5 rx n,m ) \u2248 1, F (\u03b8 t n,m , \u03d5 t n,m ) \u2248 F (\u03b8 t , \u03d5 t ), F (\u03b8 r n,m , \u03d5 r n,m ) \u2248 F (\u03b8 r , \u03d5 r ), r t n,m \u2248 d 1 , and r r n,m \u2248 d 2 into (11). Formula (16) is exactly the same as (5), which reveals that the free-space path loss gradually approaches (6) under the RIS-assisted beamforming scenario in the near field case when both d 1 and d 2 increase. The above conclusion also holds for the small RIS as it is not related to the size of RIS. B. RIS-assisted Broadcasting 1) Specular Reflection in the Near Field Broadcasting Case: P t = 0 dBm, \u03b8 t = \u03c0 4 , \u03d5 t = \u03c0, \u2220\u0393 n,m = \u03c6 n,m = 0. The large RIS1 and X-band antennas are employed in the simulation. When d 1 or d 2 is less than 71.4 m, the near field condition of the large RIS1 is fulfilled. Fig. 10(a) shows the simulated received signal power distribution in various directions when d 1 = 2 m and d 2 = 100 m. It can be seen that a specific area which is defined as solid angle \u2126 \u2229 \u2126 t in (14) is lit up. As shown in Fig. 10(b), the near-field broadcasting formula (14) fits well with the general formula (3) when d 1 = 1 m, 2 m, and 3.5 m, which reveals that the free-space path loss follows (15) under the scenario of RIS-assisted broadcasting through specular reflection of a large RIS in the near field case. In addition, the general formula curve gradually moves from the near-field broadcasting formula curve to the far-field formula curve as d 1 increases as shown in Fig. 10(c)-(e), which indicates a transition process between the near field and the far field of the RIS. It is worth noting that the curves of the far-field formula and the near-field broadcasting formula almost overlap when d 1 = 28 m. Therefore, we redefine the boundary of the far field and the near field of the RIS as L bound , by letting (6) equals to (15) as\ndBm \u03c6 r =0 \u03c6 r =\u03c0/2 \u03c6 r =3\u03c0/2 \u03c6 r =\u03c0 \u03c6 r =\u03c0/4 \u03c6 r =7\u03c0/4 \u03c6 r =5\u03c0/4 \u03c6 r =3\u03c0/4 \u03b8 r =\u03c0/6 \u03b8 r =\u03c0/3 (\u03b8 r =\u03c0/4, \u03c6 r =0) (a)G t G r GM 2 N 2 d x d y \u03bb 2 F (\u03b8 t , \u03d5 t )F (\u03b8 r , \u03d5 r )A 2 64\u03c0 3 L 2 bound d 2 2 = G t G r \u03bb 2 A 2 16\u03c0 2 (L bound + d 2 ) 2 .(17)\nWhen d 2 is much larger than L bound (the receiver is in the far field of RIS), (17) is solved as\nL bound \u2248 M N Gd x d y F (\u03b8 t , \u03d5 t )F (\u03b8 r , \u03d5 r ) 4\u03c0 .(18)\nFor the large RIS1 simulation, L bound equals to 28.77 m, which is in good agreement with Fig.   10(d). In the rest of the paper, (18) is referred to as the boundary of the far field and the near field for RIS-assisted wireless communications. 2) Intelligent Reflection in the Near Field Broadcasting Case: P t = 0 dBm, \u03b8 t = 0. The large RIS2 and X-band antennas are employed in the simulation. \u03c6 n,m are designed to steer the reflected signal towards two desired directions: \u03b8 des = \u03c0 4 , \u03d5 des = 0 and \u03b8 des = \u03c0 4 , \u03d5 des = \u03c0. \u03c6 n,m = 0 when mod(m, 4) = 0 or 1 and \u03c6 n,m = \u03c0 when mod(m, 4) = 2 or 3 [9]. Fig. 11(a) shows the received signal power distribution in various directions when d 1 = 1 m and d 2 = 100 m. It can be observed that the large RIS2 successfully shapes the reflected signal into the two desired directions for broadcasting at the same time. As shown in Fig. 11(b), the near-field broadcasting formula (14) fits relatively well with the general formula (3), which reveals that the free-space path loss also follows (15) under the scenario of RIS-assisted broadcasting through intelligent reflection of large RIS in the near field case. \n\u03c6 r =0 \u03c6 r =\u03c0/2 \u03c6 r =3\u03c0/2 \u03c6 r =\u03c0 \u03c6 r =\u03c0/4 \u03c6 r =7\u03c0/4 \u03c6 r =5\u03c0/4 \u03c6 r =3\u03c0/4 \u03b8 r =\u03c0/6 \u03b8 r =\u03c0/3 (a)\u03c6 r =0 \u03c6 r =\u03c0/2 \u03c6 r =3\u03c0/2 \u03c6 r =\u03c0 \u03c6 r =\u03c0/4 \u03c6 r =7\u03c0/4 \u03c6 r =5\u03c0/4 \u03c6 r =3\u03c0/4 \u03b8 r =\u03c0/6 \u03b8 r =\u03c0/3 (a)\n\nC. Path Loss Simulation Summary\n\nThe numerical simulations have verified the free-space path loss models of RIS-assisted wireless communications summarized in Table I via the general formula (3). In addition, the boundary of the far field and the near field of the RIS is redefined in (18), which can be used to determine whether the transmitter/receiver is in the near or far field of the RIS.\n\n\nV. VALIDATION OF PATH LOSS MODELS VIA EXPERIMENTAL MEASUREMENTS\n\nExperimental measurements are carried out to further validate the free-space path loss models of RIS-assisted wireless communications derived in the previous sections. We set up the freespace path loss measurement system in a microwave anechoic chamber and utilize three different metasurfaces to act as the RIS in different scenarios. which indicates that the metasurface performs specular reflection for most of our measurements.\n\n\nA. Measurement Setup\n\nIn addition, we also measured an intelligent reflection scenario, in which the incident wave is perpendicular to the metasurface and the reflected wave is manipulated into two directions simultaneously.  Fig. 13 shows the metasurfaces, X-band horn antennas, and C-band horn antennas utilized in the free-space path loss measurements in different scenarios. Their main parameters are consistent with those used for the simulations described in Table II at the beginning of Section IV. \n\n\nB. Measurement Results\n\nWe utilize the two large RISs and the small RIS to measure the free-space path loss in the RIS- with the theoretical general formula (3) and the proposed near-field broadcasting formula (14).\n\nThe measurement results practically validate that the free-space path loss of RIS-assisted wireless communication follows (15) under the scenario of specular reflection through a large RIS in the near field broadcasting case. The path loss is proportional to (d 1 + d 2 ) 2 . It should be noted that in order to fairly compare the measurement result with the theoretical models, we measured the actual value of G t G r A r G lineloss (the product of the Tx antenna gain, Rx antenna gain, Rx antenna effective aperture, and cable loss) and substituted it into the proposed theoretical formulas.  2) Intelligent Reflection of Large RIS2 in the Near Field Broadcasting Case: The incident wave is perpendicular to the large RIS2 and the reflected wave is reflected towards two paths (\u03b8 r = \u03c0 4 , \u03d5 r = \u03c0 and \u03b8 r = \u03c0 4 , \u03d5 r = 0) simultaneously, as sketched in Fig. 15(a). Fig. 15(b) illustrates the measured received signal power along the two paths versus d 2 when d 1 = 1m. We can see that the trend of the two measurement curves are exactly the same as that of the proposed theoretical curves, and the difference between them is only about 3 dB, which may be caused by the measurement imperfections. For example, the metasurface is not completely perpendicular to the ground, which causes the deviation of the reflected wave angle. The measurement results validate that the free-space path loss of RIS-assisted wireless communication follows (15) under the scenario of intelligent reflection through a large RIS in the near field broadcasting case.\n(b)\n3) Specular Reflection of Small RIS in the Far Field Beamforming Case: Let all the unit cells of the small RIS have the same reflection coefficient by applying a same control voltage (0 V) to them. The transmit power is fixed to 0 dBm and the small RIS specularly reflects the incident signal to the direction of \u03b8 r = \u03c0 4 and \u03d5 r = 0, along which we measured the received signal power as depicted in Fig.12. Fig.16 illustrates the measured received signal power versus d 1 and d 2 . We observe that the measurement results are in good agreement with the theoretical general formula (3) and the proposed far-field formula (4). The difference between them is only about 2 dB, which may be caused by the measurement imperfections. The measurement results practically validate that the free-space path loss of RIS-assisted wireless communication follows (6) under the scenario of specular reflection through RIS in the far field beamforming case. The free-space path loss is proportional to (d 1 d 2 ) 2 when the RIS-assisted wireless communications aim to achieve beamforming in the far field case.      which is based on the assumption that \u0393 n,m is not sensitive to the changes of the incident angle \u03b8 t . If \u0393 n,m is sensitive to \u03b8 t , especially if its phase \u03c6 n,m is sensitive to \u03b8 t , the channel reciprocity of RIS-assisted wireless communications will not hold anymore. We measured the relationship between the control voltage and the phase shift of the unit cells of our small RIS under different incident angles as plotted in Fig. 17. It can be observed that the used RIS is highly sensitive to the incident angle. Therefore, it is necessary to develop metasurfaces that are insensitive to the incident angle, thus ensuring channel reciprocity in RIS-assisted wireless communications. The power of the incident signal into unit cell U n,m can be expressed as P in n,m = G t P t 4\u03c0r t n,m 2 F tx \u03b8 tx n,m , \u03d5 tx n,m F \u03b8 t n,m , \u03d5 t n,m d x d y ,\n\n\n(a)\n\n\nRx horn antenna\n\nand the electric field of the incident signal into U n,m is given by \n\nwhere Z 0 is the characteristic impedance of the air, and r t n,m can be written as\nr t n,m = x t \u2212 m\u2212 1 2 d x 2 + y t \u2212 n\u2212 1 2 d y 2 +z t 2 .(21)\nAccording to the law of energy conservation, for the unit cell U n,m , the power of the incident signal times the square of the reflection coefficient is equal to the total power of the reflected signal, thus we have P in n,m \u0393 2 n,m = P ref lect\nn,m ,(22)\nwhere P ref lect n,m is the total reflected signal power of the unit cell U n,m , and the reflection coefficient can be written as \u0393 n,m = A n,m e j\u03c6n,m ,\n\nwhere A n,m and \u03c6 n,m represent the controllable amplitude and phase shift of U n,m , respectively.\n\nThe power of the reflected signal received by the receiver from U n,m can be expressed as \n\nwhere A r represent the aperture of the receiving antenna, and r r n,m can be written as\nr r n,m = x r \u2212 m\u2212 1 2 d x 2 + y r \u2212 n\u2212 1 2 d y 2 +z r 2 .(25)\nBy combining (19), (22) and (24), the electric field of the reflected signal received by the receiver from U n,m is obtained as \n\nThe total electric field of the received signal is the superposition of the electric fields reflected by all unit cells toward the receiver, which can be written as\nE r = M 2 m=1\u2212 M 2 N 2 n=1\u2212 N 2 E r n,m .(27)\nThe received signal power of the receiver is\nP r = |E r | 2 2Z 0 A r ,(28)\nwhere the aperture of the receiving antenna can be written as\nA r = G r \u03bb 2 4\u03c0 .(29)\nWe obtain Theorem 1 by substituting (26), (27), and (29) into (28).\n\n\nAPPENDIX B\n\nProof of Proposition 1\n\nThe position of the transmitter in Fig. 2 is (x t , y t , z t ) = (d 1 sin \u03b8 t cos \u03d5 t , d 1 sin \u03b8 t sin \u03d5 t , d 1 cos \u03b8 t ).\n\nBy combining (21) and (30), when the transmitter is in the far field of the RIS, r t n,m can be further expressed as\nr t n,m = d 1 sin \u03b8 t cos \u03d5 t \u2212(m\u2212 1 2 )d x 2 + d 1 sin \u03b8 t sin \u03d5 t \u2212(n\u2212 1 2 )d y 2 +(d 1 cos \u03b8 t ) 2 \u2248 d 1 \u2212 sin \u03b8 t cos \u03d5 t (m\u2212 1 2 )d x \u2212 sin \u03b8 t sin \u03d5 t (n\u2212 1 2 )d y ,(31)\nSimilarly, the position of the receiver in Fig. 2 is (x r , y r , z r ) = (d 2 sin \u03b8 r cos \u03d5 r , d 2 sin \u03b8 r sin \u03d5 r , d 2 cos \u03b8 r ).\n\nBy combining (25) and (32), when the receiver is in the far field of the RIS, r r n,m can be further expressed as \n\nIn the far field case, (\u03b8 t n,m , \u03d5 t n,m ) and (\u03b8 r n,m , \u03d5 r n,m ) can be approximated as (\u03b8 t , \u03d5 t ) and (\u03b8 r , \u03d5 r ), respectively. In addition, as assuming that the direction of peak radiation of both the transmitting antenna and receiving antenna point to the center of the RIS, we have F tx (\u03b8 tx n,m , \u03d5 tx n,m ) \u2248 1 and F rx (\u03b8 rx n,m , \u03d5 rx n,m ) \u2248 1 in the far field case.

The RF signal generator provides the RF signal with a constant power to the Tx horn antenna, which illuminates the metasurface through distance d 1 . The signal reflected by the metasurface propagates over distance d 2 , and is received by the Rx horn antenna and the RF signal analyzer, which gives the measurement result of the received signal power. Because multipath propagations are greatly suppressed in the microwave anechoic chamber and the blocking object cuts off the direct path between the Tx antenna and the Rx antenna, the received signal mainly comes from the reflection of the RIS, which ensures the feasibility of the free-space path loss measurements of RIS-assisted wireless communications. Since d 1 and d 2 need to be flexibly changed during the measurement to study the relationship of the path loss as a function of d 1 and d 2 , we utilize the two aisles perpendicular to each other in the anechoic chamber and place the metasurface at the junction of the two aisles. The angles between the metasurface and the two aisles are both 45 degrees,\n\nFig. 12 .\n12Free-space path loss measurement system of RIS-assisted wireless communications: (a) diagram.

The L bound (boundary between the far field and the near field) of the large RIS1, the large RIS2 and the small RIS is 28.77 m, 4.8 m and 0.866 m according to(18), respectively. This makes it possible to measure the path loss in the near field case of the two large RISs and in the far field case of the small RIS, as the area of the microwave anechoic chamber is about 6 m \u00d7 5 m.1) Specular Reflection of Large RIS1 in the Near Field Broadcasting Case: Let all the unit cells of the large RIS1 have the same reflection coefficient by applying a same control voltage (0 V) to them. The transmit power is fixed to 0 dBm and the large RIS1 specularly reflects the incident signal as depicted inFig.12(a). Fig.14illustrates the measured received signal power versus d 1 and d 2 , from which we can observe that the measurement results are in good agreement\n\nFig. 14 .\n14Measurement results of specular reflection through the large RIS1 in the near field broadcasting case.

Relationship between the control voltage and the phase shift of the unit cells of the used small RIS. 5) Power Consumption of the RISs: The power consumption of our small RIS is almost zero. The small RIS here is a kind of varactor-diode-based programmable metasurface and it is almost passive because the current in the varactor diodes of the unit cells is negligible when it is working. The power consumption of the two large RISs is related to the states of their unit cells. The large RISs here are a kind of PIN-diode-based programmable metasurface. The phaseshift of each unit cell can be adjusted between 0 and \u03c0 by electrically controlling the \"on\" and \"off\" state of the PIN diode of each unit cell. When the PIN diode is off, the unit cell does not consume any energy. When the PIN diode is on, on the other hand, the power consumption of one unit cell is about 0.33 mW. For example, the total power consumption of the large RIS2 is 0.280 W when it performs the intelligent reflection described above. It should be noted that the above discussions are only for the power consumptions of the metasurfaces themselves. The controller which provides the control voltages to the unit cells of the metasurface also consumes energy, and its power consumption is related to the controller's circuit design. For example, the power consumption of the controller for the small RIS here is about 0.72 W, while that for the large RIS2 is about 10 W.VI. CONCLUSIONIn this paper, we have theoretically developed the free-space path loss models of RIS-assisted wireless communications based on the electromagnetic and physics properties of the RISs. The general formula which yields the free-space path loss of RIS-assisted wireless communications in different scenarios was first proposed. Subsequently, three more insightful free-space path loss models have been derived, namely the far-field formula, the near-field beamforming formula and the near-field broadcasting formula, to characterize the free-space path loss of RIS-assisted beamforming and broadcasting, respectively. In addition, the boundary of the far field and the near field regimes of RIS-assisted wireless communications has been discussed according to the numerical simulations. Moreover, free-space path loss measurements of RIS-assisted wireless communications have been conducted in a microwave anechoic chamber by considering different scenarios. The measurement results match quite well with the modeling results, which validates the proposed path loss models. This work may help researchers in analyzing and simulating the performance of various RIS-assisted wireless communication systems for application to\n\nF\nrx \u03b8 rx n,m , \u03d5 rx n,m A r ,\n\n\n2 cos \u03b8 r ) 2 \u2248 d 2 \u2212 sin \u03b8 r cos \u03d5 r (m\u2212 1 2 )d x \u2212 sin \u03b8 r sin \u03d5 r\n\nTABLE I :\nIFree-Space Path Loss Models of RIS-assisted Wireless Communications in Different Scenarios.\n\nTABLE II :\nIIThe Parameters of Three Different RISs and Two Different Antennas Utilized in Simulations.\nAlso known as intelligent reflecting surfaces (IRSs) and passive large intelligent surfaces (LISs) in the literature.\n\nAsia-Pacific leads 5G innovation, Huawei enables sustainable development of a digital economy.
